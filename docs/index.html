    <p class=""><a href="https://setapp.com/"><span>Setapp, the app subscription service for Mac Apps</span></a>, is no longer just for Mac Apps. Last week Setapp announced that it has added seven iOS apps to the service including Ulysses, Paste, Gemini Photos, Taskheal, SQLPro Studio, Mind Node, and PDF Search with more to come in the future. </p><p class="">I have several developer friends with Apps in Setapp and I never hear the usual grumbling from them about not getting enough revenue share from the service. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. So it’s good knowing they are taking care fo the developers and as a user, I dig the service because they just keep finding more apps that I like and would never have found otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p class=""> </p>

<p>Note that with an Apple Silicon Mac, unsigned software won&rsquo;t run at all. You can sign it without needing a developer account, but you can&rsquo;t notarize it, so it will be treated to these dialogs.</p>

<p>New in macOS 11 on Apple silicon Mac computers, and starting in the next macOS Big Sur 11 beta, the operating system will enforce that any executable must be signed with a valid signature before it&rsquo;s allowed to run. There isn&rsquo;t a specific identity requirement for this signature: a simple ad-hoc signature issued locally is sufficient, which includes signatures which are now generated automatically by the linker. This new behavior doesn&rsquo;t change the long-established policy that our users and developers can run arbitrary code on their Macs, and is designed to simplify the execution policies on Apple silicon Mac computers and enable the system to better detect code modifications.</p>
<p>This new policy doesn&rsquo;t apply to translated x86 binaries running under Rosetta, nor does it apply to macOS 11 running on Intel platforms.</p>

<p>While Englebart came up with the idea for the mouse, it was English who built it out of wood, electrical switches, and metal wheels in 1963.

    <figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bitbar-menubar.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="BitBar in action" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Three BitBar plugins in action.</figcaption></figure><p>I really can’t recommend Mat Ryer’s <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar">BitBar</a> enough. It’s a free Mac utility that lets you put more or less anything you want in your menu bar. I keep finding more uses for it—at this point I’ve got four separate BitBar items in my menu bar.</p>
<p>At its simplest, BitBar is an app that runs plug-ins that display information in your menu bar. (It’s named because it was initially built to display Bitcoin prices.) There’s a whole collection of plug-ins at <a href="http://getbitbar.com">getbitbar.com</a>, so if you’re not comfortable writing your own, you might find exactly what you want. It’s also easy to modify existing plugins to do what you want—all a BitBar plugin is, is a script that runs, gets data, and then returns a value that is displayed in the menu bar.</p>
<p>Last week a friend of mine upgraded to Catalina and, in the process, lost an old Mac utility he used to display the currently playing track in iTunes/Apple Music. I suggested he look at BitBar, which has a <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Music/music.10s.sh">plugin that does just that</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that while it worked, BitBar’s plugin didn’t do exactly what he wanted. Most notably, he wanted the current track to be displayed in the format <code>Song Title - Album (Year) - Artist</code>. Since this particular plugin was a shell script, I was able to open it in BBEdit and quickly <a href="https://pastebin.com/UfBX9H4k">customize it</a> to meet his needs.</p>
<p>For example, the existing music plug-in didn’t display the year, but I was able to include a little bit of inline AppleScript within the shell script that did the trick:</p>
<pre><code>year=$(osascript -e'
set theYear to "0"
tell application "Music"
    try
        set theYear to (year of current track as string)
    on error errText
        ""
    end try
end tell
if theYear = "0" then
    return ""
else
    return ("(" &amp; theYear &amp; ")")
end if
');
</code></pre>
<p>I also ripped out a bunch of features that my friend didn’t really want, like play/pause/next/previous controls and a bunch of metadata in the dropdown menu. (Yes, BitBar will let you not just create custom text in the menu bar, but in the items that display when you click on the menu bar item.)</p>
<p>Last week Dan Moren updated a plug-in that I wrote a while back that looks at the live-stream servers of our various podcast networks and displays the current number of listeners in the menu bar. (He re-wrote the thing in PHP, since that’s a language he’s comfortable with.)</p>
<p>I’ve also got the current temperature from my weather station in my menu bar thanks to BitBar. Since I was more comfortable writing in AppleScript than in a shell script, my weather “plugin” is a single line – <code>osascript ~/weatherscript.scpt</code> – that runs a small AppleScript script that queries my weather station and returns the current temperature data, which BitBar displays.</p>
<p>Finally, I use a tiny plugin that pings my Linode server and reports back the total ping time, which is useful in determining at a glance if I’m really having network issues or if it’s just my imagination.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable in literally any scripting language that can execute on your Mac, you can build BitBar plugins to display anything you can think of in your menu bar.</p>

<p><strong>About the bag</strong></p>
<p>The bag is a <a href="https://geni.us/pJRt?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Rite in the Rain Side-Bound Notebook Cover</strong></a>. It fits a plethora of things and it’s only 5.5&#8243; x 8.5&#8243;. It’s made of Cordura, so it’s super-tough and has just enough structure to protect my brushes, palettes, and paper from the inside of my backpack.</p>

They’re compact, with a mixing palette, and various sizes of magnetic pans so you can create your own custom selection of color. They also make pre-filled palettes to give you a jump start.</p>
<p>I filled my pans with <a href="http://danielsmith.com/daniel-smith-essentials-watercolor-5ml-set-6-colors/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Daniel Smith Watercolors</strong></a>. They have more than 250 colors, which is enough to bend your brain. I started with their Essentials Set and picked up one of their Dot Cards so I could test-drive some of the colors my favorite artists use before picking some more to buy…I’m up to 34 colors now.</p>
<p>I started off with travel brushes that have a little water well in the handle, but I didn’t like how I couldn’t control the flow very well, and pretty much used them like normal brushes. So I upgraded to still <a href="https://geni.us/N8R1L6e?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>very affordable synthetic sable travel brushes</strong></a>. My prize one is real sable, from <a href="https://www.rosemaryandco.com/watercolour-brushes?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Rosemary &amp; Co</a>, but the set from Amazon is great and 3 brushes cost as much as the single nicer one.</p>
<p>I like to use <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/products/fluid-100-watercolor-paper-blocks/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>watercolor blocks of various sizes</strong></a>. The pages are glued together in a “block”, which means the paper stays flat without having to tape it down. Fluid Watercolor Blocks are a good value and quality, and come in a wide array of sizes. One of the 4&#8243; x 6&#8243; blocks fits right in the bag, or I’ll carry a bigger one along with it.</p>

Memory issues, trouble concentrating, mood changes, weight gain, and balance issues are just the start of the list. Not getting enough sleep also lowers your libido. We’re talking less sex, people! Seriously, a doctor friend once explained it to me simply: “Not getting enough sleep is like operating the human body while intoxicated.”<br><br>I’m all for playing with your schedule. If you need to get up at 3:00 a.m. to be the best you, then absolutely do it. But if you think you can do that without getting enough sleep, you’re kidding yourself.</p>

It easily shaves hardened clumps of litter from that litter box that would cause a plastic scoop to fold in half. It&#8217;s actually a beautiful looking tool, too. If Raymond Loewy designed a scoop, it would look like this (maybe the handle wouldn&#8217;t be covered with textured plastic). Cleaning cat litter is an unpleasant daily chore for me, but the DuraScoop makes it much less unpleasant.</p>

    <p>For the past few decades all the old guard political reporters have bemoaned the fact that political conventions serve no real purpose anymore and are basically just prime time ads for the political parties. Well guess what? COVID-19 has finally turned them literally into party advertisements: just a bunch of prerecorded segments edited together into a 2-hour infomercial.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s great! The pace is livelier than live conventions; more people get to speak since their segments can be more tightly controlled; and in an era of media sophistication I&#8217;ll bet viewers like it better. They know perfectly well how it&#8217;s being put together and they don&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a semi-prediction: Four years from now conventions might remain virtual. It&#8217;s a helluva lot cheaper for the parties. It makes for a better show. And the candidates have tighter control over the whole thing. The only thing missing is the buckraking parties that can only take place in person, but maybe modern fundraising techniques make those unnecessary anyway. Check back in four years to see if I&#8217;m right.</p>

    <p>David Shayer, in a rather incredible story for TidBITS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing
code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of
iPod Software — my boss’s boss — abruptly entered and closed the
door behind him. He cut to the chase. “I have a special assignment
for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two
engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod.
Report only to me.”</p>

<p>The next day, the receptionist called to tell me that two men were
waiting in the lobby. I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew,
the engineers who would actually build this custom iPod. I’d love
to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats and were glancing
in window reflections to make sure they hadn’t been tailed, but
they were perfectly normal thirty-something engineers. I signed
them in, and we went to a conference room to talk.</p>

<p>They didn’t actually work for the Department of Energy; they
worked for a division of Bechtel, a large US defense contractor to
the Department of Energy. They wanted to add some custom hardware
to an iPod and record data from this custom hardware to the iPod’s
disk in a way that couldn’t be easily detected. But it still had
to look and work like a normal iPod.</p>

<p>They’d do all the work. My job was to provide any help they needed
from Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a wild story. <a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1295727727606104064">Tony Fadell, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project was real w/o a doubt.</p>

<p>There was whole surreal drama and interesting story about how this
project was kicked off and then kept secret.</p>

    <p>David E. Sanger and Julian E. Barnes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/tiktok-security-threat.html">reporting for The New York Times last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok has long presented a parenting problem, as millions of
Americans raising preteens and teenagers distracted by its viral
videos can attest. But when the C.I.A. was asked recently to
assess whether it was also a national security problem, the answer
that came back was highly equivocal.</p>

<p>Yes, the agency’s analysts told the White House, it is possible
that the Chinese intelligence authorities could intercept data or
use the app to bore into smartphones. But there is no evidence
they have done so, despite the calls from President Trump and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to neutralize a threat from the
app’s presence on millions of American devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that TikTok is owned and controlled by a Chinese company is reason enough to be suspicious, and in my opinion <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/18/tiktok-tim-wu">reason enough to ban the service</a>. But there is no evidence to date that TikTok is a security threat in the sense that their app might be doing anything secretly nefarious on our phones. We should be concerned just by what TikTok is doing on the surface, what we see and know TikTok does — its potential as a propaganda arm of the PRC.</p>

<p>In terms of intercepting data it shouldn’t have access to, there’s no sign TikTok has ever done so and there’s no reason to think they <em>could</em> even if they wanted to. All iOS and Google Play Android apps are installed in sandboxes — no app, TikTok or otherwise, has access to data outside its sandbox. <em>Sandbox</em> is arguably a poorly-chosen word from a layperson’s perspective. It’s nothing like a real-world playground where kids can, if unsupervised, freely move from one sandbox to another (or throw sand outside their own sandbox). <a href="https://cocoacasts.com/what-is-application-sandboxing/">An application sandbox is like a virtual world unto itself</a>. They’re implemented technically, not through voluntary compliance. They are technical containers that limit what an app <em>can</em> see and do, not a list of guidelines of what an app <em>should</em> see and do. An app doing something outside its sandbox — without explicit permission from the platform via an entitlement — is exploiting a security vulnerability, not merely breaking the rules.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s possible that TikTok could be exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS and/or Android to access data they shouldn’t be able to, but there’s never been any suggestion that they are. And if they were, it would be huge news, an enormous scandal both for TikTok <em>and</em> the platform vendor (Apple or Google). Why risk it? TikTok is already sitting on a veritable golden goose, collecting information about what sort of videos hundreds of millions of users around the world enjoy watching, and controlling the secret black-box algorithm that determines what new videos those hundreds of millions of people see each time they open the TikTok and swipe up. Even if TikTok’s intentions are truly evil, they’d be fools to risk what they have by exploiting security bugs to, say, try to read emails or texts or whatever people are spooked they’re doing.</p>

<p>Being spooked that TikTok is secretly stealing your emails is like being spooked that the ATMs in a casino are stealing your bank account PIN number. Why in the world would a casino run a crooked ATM when you’re using the ATM to take out money to lose to them in slot machines? It’s theoretically possible but makes little sense.</p>

<p>But what about stories like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/biden-campaign-tiktok/index.html">the Biden campaign banning TikTok from staffers’ phones</a>? Or Amazon’s internal IT department sending out a company-wide blast <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200710/p20#a200710p20">declaring that TikTok must be removed from any device that accesses company email</a>, only to issue a “never mind” retraction hours later? People see these stories and assume TikTok must be doing something nefarious. But I very much suspect that the stories themselves are driven by the general hysteria around TikTok being up to no good.</p>

<p>Organizations like the Biden campaign and Amazon’s IT department are banning TikTok not because they know something is fishy about it but as a sort of “cover your ass just in case” thing. Given <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/john-podesta-pizzagate-766489/">what happened to the Clinton campaign’s email</a> in 2016, you can’t blame the Biden campaign for being overly cautious, if not downright paranoid. I recommend paranoia for them. But I think the reason Amazon so quickly <em>reverted</em> its ban on TikTok was because the initial ban was based on nothing more than hearsay.</p>

<p>Consider Apple and Google. Both companies have an inordinate amount of intellectual property to protect. Both companies are surely deeply concerned about the Chinese government, in particular, attempting to infiltrate their systems. Both companies also have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-brand.html">consumer brand reputations</a> to protect with the App Store and Play Store. If either company had any actual reason to suspect TikTok of malfeasance, they’d remove TikTok from their app stores. Surely, the security experts at both companies have examined TikTok with more attention than most apps get.</p>

<p>And even if they couldn’t prove anything, they’d surely be among the very first companies to ban the TikTok app from employee devices if there were any reason to suspect they should. But they haven’t. Apple and Google employees are free to swipe swipe swipe in TikTok to their hearts’ content on the same devices they use for work communication.</p>

<p>We should be concerned about TikTok only because of what we <em>know</em> they have access to: TikTok users’ attention and their interests. There’s no evidence that TikTok has access to anything else on our phones that they shouldn’t.</p>

    <p>Tim Wu, writing at The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In China, the foreign equivalents of TikTok and WeChat — video
and messaging apps such as YouTube and WhatsApp — have been
banned for years. The country’s extensive blocking,
<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/03/censored-contagion-how-information-on-the-coronavirus-is-managed-on-chinese-social-media/">censorship</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/05/we-chat-they-watch/">surveillance</a> violate just about <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2019">every
principle</a> of internet openness and decency. China keeps a
closed and censorial internet economy at home while its products
enjoy full access to open markets abroad.</p>

<p>The asymmetry is unfair and ought no longer be tolerated. The
privilege of full internet access — the open internet — should
be extended only to companies from countries that respect that
openness themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Wu addresses the fact that Trump is almost certainly wrong in his reasons for opposing TikTok, but even then he’s ultimately right in the “even a stopped clock is right twice a day” sense. We — not just the United States but the entire free world — are being played as suckers by China. You’re either part of the open internet or you’re not — and China wants no part of the open internet.</p>

<p>The idea that being exposed to the internet would inevitably help open China was a reasonable and well-intentioned theory, but it was obviously wrong. Allowing China to export its own internet services while it blocks <em>all</em> of the services from the rest of the world is both dangerous and dumb. They’re using the internet to export authoritarianism, not to import democracy and liberalism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once a simple photo-sharing app, Instagram now offers ephemeral
social media, short-form video, long-form video, video chat,
private messaging, inspiration bookmarking and shopping. I started
spending most of my time on Instagram instead of Facebook because
Facebook was too bloated. Now it feels like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-is-turning-into-facebook-and-thats-bad-1517422670">Instagram <em>is</em>
Facebook</a>. […]</p>

<p>Still, it will likely take more than a library of hit songs and
video-editing tools for Instagram to re-create TikTok’s success.
On TikTok, you don’t need an account to become addicted. It’s pure
entertainment, like TV, without the terrible fear-of-missing-out
feeling you get by looking at posts from friends and family.</p>

<p>But unlike TV, a finely tuned algorithm figures out what you see
next. And that algorithm is freakishly good. You scroll and scroll
until you’re physically exhausted and can’t scroll any longer.</p>

<p>Instagram’s recommendations aren’t quite there yet. I watched a
haphazard mix of imported TikToks, manic 15-second cooking videos
and clips of celebrities … being celebrities. There’s little of
the eclectic weird magic found on TikTok’s main feed, its
personalized “For You” page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It feels odd talking about “the good old days” of Instagram, but well, I enjoyed Instagram a <em>lot</em> more when it was focused simply and exquisitely on photo sharing. Obviously I don’t speak for the greater world — Instagram got a lot more popular as I deemed it to be getting worse.</p>

<p>But there has to be a limit to how much Facebook can cram into Instagram before it bursts at the seams, and Reels feels like too much. TikTok just doesn’t feel Instagrammy <em>at all</em>, so I don’t think the problem with Reels is execution, I think it’s just the basic idea of using Instagram to host Facebook’s TikTok clone. It’s a bad fit, and Facebook doesn’t have the taste to know it. Facebook is like a society in a sci-fi novel that polluted and ruined its home world (Facebook), colonized a beautiful new world (Instagram), and just went ahead and immediately polluted and ruined the new world in the exact same way.</p>

<p>(Call it a hunch, or maybe just wishful thinking, but I think someone could have a nice hit with a great clone of the old original photo-sharing Instagram. Not a goliath titan of the tech industry hit, just a nice profitable hit. Like making a nice successful restaurant, never intended to be a nationwide chain with 1,000 locations.)</p>

    <p>Don Giller is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/fashion/mens-style/david-letterman-late-show-don-giller.html">unofficial archivist</a> of David Letterman’s talk show career. It’s a crying shame that a curated sample of Letterman’s output from his NBC and CBS shows isn’t on a streaming service somewhere, but all of it is in Don Giller’s archive and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWmcFDWz7evOe0Zbly3l8Q">some of it is on his YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>His latest video compilation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBSOuVS_u4&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Faces Project Part 1</a>, begins with some dialogue between Letterman and bandleader Paul Shaffer in late 1989 as they were preparing for their eighth anniversary special (which I attended!): “We’re looking at stuff that we did, you and I, eight years ago. Boy do we look dorky…. My fear is that eight years from now we’ll look at tapes from tonight and I’ll be saying the same thing.”</p>
<p>What follows is Letterman’s face from every episode of the show on NBC, 1,810 shows aired between 1982 until 1993. <a href="https://donzblog.home.blog/2020/08/18/the-making-of-the-faces-project/">Don explains how he did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Searching and selecting appropriate screen-captures took a full month. “Tedious” doesn’t begin to describe the slog…. I used iMovie 9 for its relative simplicity. Instead of importing every image into one iMovie file, which would have slowed the processing down considerably, I instead chose the modular approach, creating one file per show year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an amazing project and over 13 minutes you can watch Letterman age 11 years.</p>

    <p>One of my mother&#8217;s trees attracts a vast number of dragonflies, so I went out a couple of weeks ago and shot a bunch of pictures of them. They turned out to be pretty cooperative! I suppose this guy is some particular species of dragonfly, but trying to become an instant expert on dragonfly ID is a little beyond me at the moment. Maybe someone in comments can help.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Apparently it&#8217;s a female Flame Skimmer.</p>

    <p>One of the secrets to being an efficient computer power user is mastering the use of keyboard shortcuts. When you can tap a couple of keys and kick off something that otherwise would’ve required you to take your hands off the keyboard, move to your pointing device, push the pointer around on the screen, and click to get to a command, your efficiency blooms.</p>
<p>There are a lot of utilities out there that will let you attach almost any command you can imagine to a keyboard shortcut, and I use some of them. But for the purposes of this column, I wanted to praise the one that Apple provides with macOS itself: the Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard pane in the System Preferences app. It’s always my first stop when I’m trying to see if I can add a keyboard shortcut to my workflow.</p>
<p>The Shortcuts pane is subdivided, with nine categories on the left and the contents of the selected categories on the right. Many of Apple’s default system shortcuts are here, and you can turn them off by unchecking the box on the left of the list—which is very handy if you keep typing a shortcut by mistake.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/its-time-for-apple-to-change-the-app-store-sales-model-f9ff09dd314f"><p>But that is not the app world of 2020. It has become a huge, multifaceted market, with multiple platforms, crossover with the web, and a multitude ways to make money. Very few companies now live solely within Apple&rsquo;s city walls; they are more like multinationals, with offices in many cities, trading across borders in a global marketplace. Apple&rsquo;s simplistic feudal system, taxing income alone, feels dated.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[The] landlord&rsquo;s success is based on bringing value to the property itself, and my success derives from how well I execute on my business, the restaurant. It would feel wrong if the landlord demanded a cut of the restaurant profits, something they have had no part in.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To make it in today&rsquo;s app world, you have to find your own users. A company like Netflix will have benefited very little from being featured by Apple, and that is no doubt why they feel miffed at Apple taking 30% of income they have worked hard for.</p></blockquote>

<p>He wants a rent-like fee based on download tiers, plus a (smaller) percentage for apps that use Apple&rsquo;s payment processing.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1295031241746649089">Max Seelemann</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1295031241746649089"><p>We&rsquo;d be a step closer to fairness if apps that monetize outside would also pay for the visibility and distribution. Especially business apps and ad-driven platforms pay nothing but get all the benefits for free.</p>
<p>Developers don&rsquo;t owe Apple for the iPhone or the toolchain. That&rsquo;s nuts. Apple earns for that from the devices sales. Building an SDK is a service for the users not the developers. They sell more phones because of apps available and their quality.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/"><p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple&rsquo;s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn&rsquo;t support traditional trials or upgrades, the importance of which I&rsquo;ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/depth42/status/1295640388779347968">Frank Illenberger</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/depth42/status/1295640388779347968">
<p>I would be more than happy to pay 30% for sales through the Apple App Stores if they were first class for both customers and developers. But until we get there they have to fix a lot of problems[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The StoreKit framework is deficient. Implementing subscriptions is extremely tedious and unreliable and the customer facing purchase UI only consists of raw modal alerts loosely popping up in any order.</p>
<p>Why are subscription apps and apps with free trials treated as if they were free? This is deeply wrong, confusing, and is leading to a load of problems like unwarranted bad reviews and unfair placement in the charts.</p>
<p>Apple does not offer a path for paid upgrades but at the same time limits the types of apps that are eligible for subscriptions. This severely restricts business opportunities for a lot of apps.</p>

@tim_cook in 2015 was part of the congressional record in the antitrust hearings earlier this month. My email was about App Review gaining too much power (back in 2015!)</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple removed our popular iOS app which at the time was visited by 750k devices each day. Our app was an app recommendation app that curated the App Store into lists of best apps to download. In late 2014 it was removed from the App Store without warning.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>The reason they listed was not their true motivations.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190694">Mahmoud Hafez</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24189341">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190694"><p>I subsequently spoke to Phillip Shoemaker, who confirmed that Apple executives ordered the elimination of apps that drove downloads to the App Store. He said &ldquo;Your app drove download volume. Apple doesn&rsquo;t want any outside sources to drive ratings. So yeah, we got rid of all app recommendation apps.&rdquo; He said he thought it was unfair, but this was something Apple set out to do, and even as Senior Director of App Store (person directly in charge of App Review), he could not stop it.</p>
<p>The other thing that was hard to understand, is we used to have a great relationship with Apple. We were not flying under the radar. Since the App Store first launched in 2008, we used to be invited to all Apple events to see the new product launches, we met with the iTunes team to discuss upcoming initiates for the App Store, our apps were featured on the devices inside of many demo units into Apple Stores. It felt like a complete 180, and until this day I never got a formal conversation on what they actually objected to, beyond being pointed to a vague rule which was applied arbitrarily. They became a brick wall in terms of communication, and this is why I resorted to emailing Tim Cook. </p></blockquote>

<p>How can this be, when Tim Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/28/tim-cook-antitrust-opening-statement-app-store/">told Congress</a> that the rules are &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; and Apple wants to &ldquo;get every app we can on the store, not keep them off&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/015127.pdf">letter</a> (PDF):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/015127.pdf"><p>When we saw some apps get removed, it made us more steadfast in our mission. Because we believed the fact that we were not bothered is because we were doing it the "right1 way. We were really serving the user and the App Store. Not selling fake "recommendations" as deceptive ads. We literally turned down millions of dollars in revenues, as developers repeatedly asked to pay per install to be featured in our app (outside of tradition advertising).</p>

<p>I always thought I knew what these guidelines were trying to protect. People gaming the App Store charts and users being tricked into believing bad apps were the best. But we are not doing that. I can&rsquo;t even make up a reason why I think Apple would not want our app on the Store. It&rsquo;s a great app with [redacted] 5 star reviews and countless thank you emails from our users.</p>
<p>I fear App Review is getting too powerful. It&rsquo;s no longer about keeping iDevices safe or protecting the user&rsquo;s best interest. It&rsquo;s now about something else which I don&rsquo;t understand. I am not alone in this observation and it honestly makes developing on the platform scary.</p></blockquote>

<p>The average big company CEO now makes 320 times as much as the average worker. That doesn&#8217;t yet match the glorious heights reached at the end of the dotcom boom, but it&#8217;s getting there—and 2020 is looking good so far.</p>
<p>Just imagine: as recently as 1990, CEO pay was only about 60 times that of the average worker. That&#8217;s only 30 years ago. If a big time CEO was paid that amount today he&#8217;d be the laughingstock of his country club.</p>

    <p>On September 18, from 2-8 PM Eastern, Myke Hurley and I will be hosting the second annual Podcastathon for St. Jude, raising money for an amazing institution that treats children without their families ability to pay.</p>
<p>That work begins today. We&#8217;d love to have you join us in raising $315,000 for St. Jude. The Relay FM community really rallied around this last year, and I think 2020&#8217;s campaign will be even better.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 17. There are two things to notice. First, Italy&#8217;s blip is continuing. Second, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f51d161d-86c7-40cd-a5f6-cb72ab52b026">in the UK,</a> &#8220;The government has overhauled the way coronavirus death data is compiled in England after scientists revealed Public Health England had been counting people as having died from the virus regardless of when they tested positive. The move meant the UK death toll was revised downwards by 5,377 to 41,329 on Wednesday after a review concluded the daily death figure should only include deaths which had occurred within 28 days of a positive test. The new methodology brings England in line with rest of the UK.&#8221; Johns Hopkins caught up with this today, which is why the UK trendline is suddenly at zero and the cumulative death rate has suddenly declined to 628 per million.</p>
<p>The raw data from Johns Hopkins is <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv">here.</a></p>

<p id="p2">Today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/apple-announces-apple-music-radio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> an expansion and rebranding for Apple Music&rsquo;s radio efforts. The flagship worldwide radio station Beats 1 is being renamed Apple Music 1 while retaining the same content as before.</p>
<p id="p3">Joining Apple Music 1 in Apple&rsquo;s lineup of global radio stations will be two new stations: Apple Music Hits and Apple Music Country. The former is dedicated to well-known and well-loved songs from the &lsquo;80s, &lsquo;90s, and 2000s, while the latter highlights modern and classic country music.</p>
<p id="p4">Like Apple Music 1&rsquo;s roster of hosts and presenters, which includes Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Brooke Reese, Apple&rsquo;s two new stations will have daily on-air hosts as well. For Apple Music Hits this includes Jayde Donovan, Estelle, Lowkey, and more; Apple Music Country will be hosted by Kelleigh Bannen, Ty Bentli, and Bree, among others.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/24a9781d-41fc-42bd-8c2f-01dbb39885be.jpeg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p6">One of the unique strengths of Apple Music 1, besides its strong team of hosts, is the periodic shows by artists such as Billie Eilish, Elton John, and Frank Ocean. Apple has assembled just as impressive an assortment of shows for its new stations. Per Apple&rsquo;s press release, Apple Music Hits will feature exclusive shows from &ldquo;Backstreet Boys, Ciara, Mark Hoppus, Huey Lewis, Alanis Morissette, Snoop Dogg, Meghan Trainor, Shania Twain, and more.&rdquo; For Apple Music Country the list of shows is even longer, featuring:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  Jimmie Allen, Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, BRELAND, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs, Morgan Evans, Florida Georgia Line, Pat Green, Willie Jones, Chrissy Metz, Midland, Rissi Palmer, The Shires, Carrie Underwood, and Morgan Wallen, alongside exclusive shows from legendary producers and songwriters like Dave Cobb, Jesse Frasure, and Luke Laird, and journalist Hunter Kelly.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">Apple Music hasn&rsquo;t changed its radio product much over the years, so today&rsquo;s announcements represent a significant move for the company. While I still wish the Music app provided better tools for informing me when a new radio show I may be interested in is coming up, such as push notifications as a show&rsquo;s starting, perhaps today&rsquo;s moves are just the beginning. Now that the content side of radio has been enhanced, perhaps this fall&rsquo;s updated Music app will offer improvements to the software side of the radio experience.</p>

    <p>One of the great things about not being—or having aspirations of being—a professional Apple blogger is that there’s no compulsion to write about every Apple story that pops up. I was reminded of this a few days ago when the Apple/Epic war broke out. As my RSS reader filled with links and summaries and hot takes, a wave of relief washed over me. It was like seeing that my grades on the midterms and homework were good enough that I didn’t have to take the final exam.</p>
<p>Mind you, it’s not that I have no opinions. My chief opinion is that I should update my <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/11/simpler-syndication/">homemade feedreading system</a> to give me a faster way to delete tedious entries.</p>

    <p>The floor of <em>y</em> is the greatest integer less than or equal to <em>y</em> and is denoted ⌊<em>y</em>⌋.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ceiling of <em>y</em> is the smallest integer greater than or equal to <em>y</em> and is denoted ⌈<em>y</em>⌉.</p>
<p>Both of these notations were introduced by Kenneth Iverson. Before Iverson&#8217;s notation caught on, you might see [<em>x</em>] for the floor of <em>x</em>, and I don&#8217;t know whether there was a notation for ceiling. </p>
<p>There was also a lack of standardization over whether [<em>x</em>] meant to round <em>x</em> down or round it to the nearest integer. Iverson&#8217;s notation caught on because it&#8217;s both mnemonic and symmetrical.</p>
<p>Iverson also invented the notation of using a Boolean expression inside square brackets to indicate the function that is 1 when the argument is true and 0 when it is false. I find this notation very convenient. I&#8217;ve used it on projects for two different clients recently.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an equation from <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4AnOl">Concrete Mathematics</a> using all three Iverson notations discussed here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">⌈<em>x</em>⌉ &#8211; ⌊<em>x</em>⌋ = [<em>x</em> is not an integer].</p>
<p>In words, the ceiling of <em>x</em> minus the floor of <em>x</em> is 1 when <em>x</em> is not an integer and 0 when <em>x</em> is an integer.</p>

    <p>Emacs has a relatively convenient way to add accents to letters or to insert a Unicode character if you know the code point for the value. See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/emacs_unicode/">these notes</a>.</p>
<p>But usually you don&#8217;t know the Unicode values of symbols. Then what do you do?</p>
<h2>TeX commands</h2>
<p>You enter symbols by typing their corresponding TeX commands by using</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET tex</pre>
<p>After doing that, you could, for example, enter π by typing <code>\pi</code>.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see the backslash as you type the command, but once you finish you&#8217;ll see the symbol instead [1].</p>
<h2>HTML entities</h2>
<p>You may know the HTML entity for a symbol and want to use that to enter characters in Emacs. Unfortunately, the following does NOT work.</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET html</pre>
<p>However, there is a slight variation on this that DOES work:</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET sgml</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve set your input method to sgml, you could, for example, type <code>&amp;radic;</code> to insert a √ symbol.</p>
<p>Why SGML rather than HTML?</p>
<p>HTML was created by simplifying SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). Emacs is older than HTML, and so maybe Emacs supported SGML before HTML was written.</p>
<p>There may be some useful SGML entities that are not in HTML, though I don&#8217;t know. I imagine these days hardly anyone knows anything about SGML beyond the subset that lives on in HTML and XML.</p>
<h2>Changing input modes</h2>
<p>If you want to move between your default input mode and TeX mode, you can use the command <code>toggle-input-method</code>. This is usually mapped to <code>C-u C-\</code>. </p>
<p>You can see a list of all available input methods with <code>list-input-methods</code>. Most of these are spoken languages, such as Arabic or Welsh, rather than technical input modes like TeX and SGML. </p>
<h2>More Emacs posts</h2>

</ul>
<p>[1] I suppose there could be a problem if one command were a prefix of another. That is, if there were symbols <code>\foo</code> and <code>\foobar</code> and you intended to insert the latter, Emacs might think you&#8217;re done after you&#8217;ve typed the former. But I can&#8217;t think of a case where that would happen. TeX commands are nearly <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/09/03/prefix-codes/">prefix codes</a>. There are TeX commands like <code>\tan</code> and <code>\tanh</code>, but these don&#8217;t represent symbols per se. Emacs doesn&#8217;t need any help to insert the letters &#8220;tan&#8221; or &#8220;tanh&#8221; into a file.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Epic’s announcement that Apple is threatening to terminate their membership in the Apple Developer Program prompted me to look at the current terms of the developer program license agreement. The terms are pretty clear that Apple <em>can</em> do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><bold>11.2 Termination</bold></p>

<p>This Agreement and all rights and licenses granted by Apple
hereunder and any services provided hereunder will terminate,
effective immediately upon notice from Apple: […]</p>

<p>(f) if You engage, or encourage others to engage, in any
    misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act
    relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
    misrepresenting the nature of Your submitted Application
    (e.g., hiding or trying to hide functionality from Apple’s
    review, falsifying consumer reviews for Your Application,
    engaging in payment fraud, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a court of law, Apple seems well within its rights to terminate Epic’s membership. In the court of public opinion, Apple comes off looking heavy-handed here, especially as it pertains to Unreal Engine. To be clear, Apple is not banning or even mentioning games that use Unreal Engine; what Epic is saying is that all games that use Unreal Engine will be affected as a byproduct of Epic no longer being able to work on Unreal Engine for Apple’s platforms. It’s further escalation on both sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Epic: <em>Surprise! We snuck our own payment processing into a Fortnite update.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>Fortnite is no longer listed in the App Store and we’re not going to approve updates until Fortnite complies with our rules.</em></li>
<li>Epic: <em>We’re suing and releasing a video to all our users that paints Apple as an oppressive monopolist bully.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>We’re revoking Epic’s developer program membership.</em> (Would Apple have done this even without Epic having filed a lawsuit? Not clear.)</li>
<li>Epic: <em>Without a membership we’ll be forced to cease development of Unreal Engine for iOS and MacOS.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(Honestly, the most shocking thing about the Apple Developer Program License Agreement is that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/services-account/agreement/XV2A27GUJ6/content/pdf">the PDF</a> is entirely typeset in Arial. Clearly it should be San Francisco, but Helvetica would be acceptable. Arial should be a firing offense.)</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users
and a great business opportunity for all developers. Epic has been
one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing
into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS
customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company
as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the
Store. The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can
easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that
reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which
apply to all developers. We won’t make an exception for Epic
because we don’t think it’s right to put their business interests
ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a good statement. Epic has been clear that they aren’t seeking a permanent exception to the App Store Guidelines, or a special deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/amazon_apple_prime_video">like Amazon’s for Prime Video</a> (which Apple wasn’t going to offer them anyway — games are different). They want to see Apple (and Google) change their platforms. So the “exception” Apple speaks of, I think, would be allowing Fortnite to remain in the App Store with its own payment processing while the lawsuit is litigated — and perhaps allowing Epic to keep its developer program membership?</p>

<p>So who blinks first? I think Epic will blink, submit a Fortnite update that reverts to compliance with the App Store guidelines, and try to save face by saying, “<em>Look at what Apple forced us to do — we had to raise V-Bucks prices</em>”. But they’ll keep their lawsuit going. The lawsuit, I think they’re serious about. The Fortnite update with their own payment processing was a publicity stunt.</p>

<p>The thing is, Epic isn’t just a game publisher. They’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games">a platform vendor too</a>. One of the core things developers want from a platform vendor is stability, in every sense of the word. If I were a game developer who depends on Unreal Engine, I’d be irate at Epic. They’re creating drama and eroding trust over a fight that Unreal Engine licensees aren’t a part of and didn’t sign up for. Fortnite users — especially kids — might blame Apple for Fortnite disappearing from iOS. But professional game developers will blame Epic if Unreal Engine updates are hindered by this.</p>

    <p>India is the battleground for the soul of the internet. Global tech giants are carving another new piece in an internet that has already fractured into a Chinese net, US net and worse. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally tend to be the domain of nations and monopolies. We spent the last 3 years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. We use lasers instead of expensive underground fibre and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100× cheaper to deploy and 10× cheaper for customers.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">A few big scoops from Mark Gurman yesterday</a> that got lost in the shuffle a bit after Epic went to war against the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino,
California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early
as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said. […]</p>

<p>There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package
will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive
variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming
service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier
bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Apple One” passes the sniff test as a credible name for the bundle. But this description, if accurate, seems contrary to the spirit of the name. It’s not just <em>one</em> bundle, which to me is what Apple ought to offer. What Gurman describes is a frustrating jumble of à la carte offerings that seems no different than the current situation, where every Apple subscription offering is a standalone service, other than some sort of discount for subscribing to more than one service, but only if you subscribe to them in certain predefined tiers.</p>

<p>What Gurman is describing would offer nothing, for example, if you want Apple Music/TV+ and additional iCloud storage but have no interest in Arcade or News+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company is also developing a new subscription for virtual
fitness classes that can be used via an app for the iPhone, iPad
and Apple TV, the people said. That service will be offered in a
higher-end bundle with the rest of Apple’s services. Codenamed
“Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered
by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.,
according to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This service simultaneously seems like a very keen offering from a company that is focused more and more on health and fitness features across its platforms (especially Watch) <em>and</em> more fuel to the fire that Apple unfairly competes against popular services from third parties.</p>

<p><strike>Total scoop for Gurman here if this pans out — this is the first anyone has reported this, I believe.</strike> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/09/apple-ios-14-fitness-app-guided-workouts/">MacRumors had a report on this back in March</a>, including the codename “Seymour”, but if it’s a paid subscription and not a free app, that’s still a scoop for Gurman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will
work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as
many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to
save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the
package chosen. For example, if a family subscribes today to all
of Apple’s major services plus the highest iCloud storage tier,
that would cost about $45 a month. A new bundle could knock more
than $5 off that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not much of a discount. To me the whole point of a bundle should be twofold: a greatly simplified offering (“<em>Just buy Apple One and get it all</em>”) at a <em>very</em> compelling price (“<em>Even if you don’t think you care about, say, Arcade and News+, hey, you’re effectively getting them for free</em>”.)</p>

<p>That’s the secret sauce to Amazon Prime. It’s a simple decision — get Prime or don’t — at a compelling price that makes everything other than the free shipping on Amazon purchases feel “free”.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1293892274875768832">Peter Kafka, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long-awaited/predicted Apple bundles, coming this fall. The
problem: Bundles work when they include the thing people
love/want/need — sports for cable tv, free delivery for Amazon.
These bundles — per Bloomberg, are made up of Apple’s side gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great bundle offering does have a linchpin. And while Prime and cable TV are good examples of that, they’re at extremes pricing-wise. Prime makes it feel like a good deal for shipping and everything else is free; cable TV makes it feel like you’re paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels you never watch just to get the ones you do (sports or otherwise).</p>

<p>So let’s think this through and figure out what Apple One “should” include and cost.</p>

<p>The big difference with Apple’s services is that everything is a standalone service, with reasonable à la carte pricing. Arcade and TV+ are just $5/month, including automatic family sharing. News+ is $10/month, including sharing. Music is $10 individually, and $15/month for a family sharing account. Music and News+ cost more (and Music, alone among Apple’s content offerings, charges extra for family sharing) because Apple doesn’t own the content.</p>

<p>Then there’s iCloud, the paid storage tiers for which haven’t changed in years. Right now in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 GB: $1/mo</li>
<li>200 GB: $3/mo</li>
<li>2 TB: $10/mo</li>
</ul>

<p>My back-of-the-envelope proposal is that Apple One should cost $15/month for an individual and $20/month for family sharing, and include: Music, TV+, Arcade, and the top tier of iCloud storage. Make News+ a $5/add-on.</p>

<p>Basically: start with Apple Music as the lynchpin service in the bundle, charge $5 more than they currently are for Music alone, and include everything Apple owns the entirety of: TV+, Arcade, and iCloud storage. I think they have to charge extra for News+ to pay the participating providers — News+ is more like a bundle unto itself. And that still leaves <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209670">TV Channels</a> as extra monthly add-ons, too. What Gurman describes sounds basically like “<em>Pay for a bunch of services on top of Apple Music, get one of them free</em>”; what I’m suggesting is more “<em>Pay for one additional service on top of Apple Music, get the rest free</em>”.</p>

<p>That would make for a simple proposition at a compelling price.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>James Batchelor, writing for GamesIndustry back in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-31-30-percent-store-tax-is-a-high-cost-says-sweeney-as-fortnite-skips-google-play">when Epic decided to try launching Fortnite on Android without going through the Play Store</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company’s CEO Tim Sweeney tells GamesIndustry.biz that this is
in part to build “a direct relationship with all our customers”,
but that the decision is also “motivated by economic efficiency” — namely avoiding the need to pay Google a 30 per cent cut of all
revenue generated by the game.</p>

<p>“The 30 per cent store tax is a high cost in a world where game
developers’ 70 per cent must cover all the cost of developing,
operating, and supporting their games,” he explains.</p>

<p>“There’s a rationale for this on console where there’s enormous
investment in hardware, often sold below cost, and marketing
campaigns in broad partnership with publishers. But on open
platforms, 30 per cent is disproportionate to the cost of the
services these stores perform, such as payment processing,
download bandwidth, and customer service.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortnite, as a fully-supported-by-Android download outside the Play Store, wasn’t successful, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software">Epic begrudgingly put Fortnite back in the Play Store four months ago</a>. So I think a fair reading of Sweeney’s argument is that he’s OK with Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo requiring a 70/30 revenue split because they deserve it, because they invest in hardware, sell hardware at or below cost, and provide marketing campaigns that help publishers get their games in front of users. Google’s Play Store doesn’t earn that same 30 percent cut for some reason, even though (a) Google sells very little Android hardware itself, (b) <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/19/apple-earned-66-of-the-entire-smartphone-markets-profits-in-2019">the handset makers that do sell Android hardware generally do so at or below cost</a>, and when Epic tried going direct to users on Android they didn’t do well and determined they needed to be in the Play Store.</p>

<p>Not a great argument, in my opinion. I’d say the saga of Fortnite for Android specifically shows that Google’s Play Store does serve a role very much analogous to that of dedicated game console platforms. You can certainly argue that none of them deserve 30 percent of revenue, or that none of them should allow alternative payment services, but it doesn’t hold water to say that Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo’s rules are fine but Google Play Store’s are not.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s from 2018, and leaves out the other mobile app store: Apple’s. <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1273276548569841667">Here’s Tim Sweeney from just two months ago</a>, after being asked on Twitter why he demands Apple allow iOS apps to process payments directly but not Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consoles are unique in that the hardware is sold at or below the
cost of manufacturing, and is subsidized by software sales,
whereas iOS and Android are insanely profitable for Apple and
Google from just hardware sales and ads.</p>

<p>So I don’t have a problem with the concept of console platform
fees. Consoles could ultimately benefit from richer store
ecosystems though. What if some day you could purchase a game once
and own it on all platforms that support the game, PC, console,
and mobile?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same tweet in which he says “I don’t have a problem with the concept of console platform fees” he explains exactly why he has a problem with console fees. Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch fees are 30 percent<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-17">1</a></sup> and mandatory. Also, this doesn’t sound so much like a benefit to console <em>makers</em> as it does a benefit to console <em>players</em> and, well, to game publishers like Epic. The pro-consumer argument is perfectly valid, but it applies every bit as much to game consoles as to app stores.</p>

<p>As for the main thrust of his “game consoles are different” argument, it is undeniably true that Apple makes a lot of money from iPhone and iPad hardware sales. And Google effectively makes most of its money, across its entire business, from ads. But “<em>Apple makes enough money from hardware and Google makes enough money from ads</em>” does not a compelling argument make, unless you’re a pretty hardcore anti-capitalist, and Tim Sweeney does not exactly seem like an anti-capitalist. And in terms of the law, it seems generous to even call it <em>dubious</em>. It tastes like weak sauce even by the standards of sauce obtained from The Weak Sauce Store.</p>

<p>Even though Microsoft itself just got itself into <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">an Xbox-related high-profile controversy with Apple</a> regarding its iOS App Store policies, I suggest not holding your breath waiting for Microsoft (let alone Sony or Nintendo) to file a  friend of the court brief for Epic, or even to offer Epic a word (or tweet) of encouragement. If Epic registers a significant win against Apple and Google in this fight, the game consoles are likely next.</p>

<p>How do we know the big three game consoles charge 30 percent? Here we can turn to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/22/app-store-economists">the report Apple commissioned from economists at Analysis Group</a> last month, leading up to Tim Cook’s testimony at a congressional antitrust hearing. Here is that report’s Table 2, “Commission Rates for Select Video Game Digital Marketplaces”:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Epic says that Apple has threatened to cut off its access to all iOS and Mac developer tools as retaliation for sneaking a new payment option into Fortnite last week — a stunt that ended in the app being banned from the App Store and Epic filing a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple, claiming it places illegal restrictions on the distribution of iOS apps.</p>
<p>  Apple will terminate Epic’s inclusion in the Apple Developer Program, a membership that’s necessary to distribute apps on iOS devices or use Apple developer tools, if the company does not “cure your breaches” to the agreement within two weeks, according to a letter from Apple that was shared by Epic. Epic won’t be able to notarize Mac apps either, a process that could make installing Epic’s software more difficult or block it altogether. Apple requires that all apps are notarized before they can be run on newer versions of macOS, even if they’re distributed outside the App Store.</p>
<p>  Epic has filed for a preliminary injunction against Apple, asking the court to stop the company from cutting it off. Epic says it will be “irreparably harmed long before final judgment comes” if it does not obtain the injunction. “Apple’s actions will irreparably damage Epic’s reputation among Fortnite users and be catastrophic for the future of the separate Unreal Engine business,” Epic writes. Epic also asks for Fortnite — with its lowered prices and alternate payment option — to be returned to the App Store.

<p>A lot of people thinks that this will enough for Epic to come back to the App Store, but it also feels like Apple is dumping fuel on the antitrust fire here.</p>

    <p>Epic Games Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and has informed Epic
that on Friday, August 28 Apple will terminate all our developer
accounts and cut Epic off from iOS and Mac development tools. We
are asking the court to stop this retaliation. Details here:</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf">https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Epic’s motion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>First</em>, Apple’s actions harm millions of innocent consumers
worldwide — the players who enjoy Fortnite and other Epic games — which will sever their trust with Epic, a loss that is
impossible to quantify. Because Apple has now removed Fortnite
from the App Store, iOS users cannot receive updates and will soon
be stranded in an outdated version of the game, unable to connect
with family and friends who will play future versions on other
platforms. iOS users will also lose access to new content that
Epic regularly releases, such as the eagerly anticipated new
season of the game scheduled to launch at the end of this month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s motion suggests the only solution here is for Apple to be forced, by the court, to re-list Fortnite in the App Store while allowing Epic to continue using their own in-app purchasing system. The alternative, of course, would be for Epic to submit a Fortnite update that removes their rule-breaking in-app purchasing system. Until this is resolved, there are three possible states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple is forced to restore Fortnite in the store and allow Epic to flagrantly disregard the App Store guidelines on in-app purchasing until the legal case is settled.</li>
<li>Epic can remove its own payment system and Fortnite goes back in the App Store in compliance with the existing rules.</li>
<li>Epic refuses to submit an update in compliance with the current rules, the court refuses to force Apple to restore Fortnite in the interim, and iOS Fortnite users miss out on the new season, and new users can’t get Fortnite for iOS.</li>
</ul>

<p>(It’s worth noting that anyone who previously downloaded Fortnite for iOS can still get it. Like if you previously downloaded it and subsequently deleted it, or if you get a new iPhone or iPad and need to reinstall all your apps, or even if someone other than you in your family account previously installed it. I don’t know if that will change on August 28, if Apple goes through with revoking Epic’s developer account.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Left unchecked, Apple’s actions will irreparably damage Epic’s
reputation among Fortnite users and be catastrophic for the future
of the separate Unreal Engine business. If the Unreal Engine can
no longer support Apple platforms, the software developers that
use it will be forced to use alternatives. The damage to Epic’s
ongoing business and to its reputation and trust with its
customers will be unquantifiable and irreparable. Preliminary
injunctive relief is necessary to prevent Apple from crushing Epic
before this case could ever get to judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll just go out on a limb here and guess that no matter how this gets resolved, we won’t be seeing any more <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unreal%20engine%20demo%20apple%20keynote">Unreal Engine demos on stage at Apple keynotes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The morning Epic made these options available, Apple removed
Fortnite from the App Store, ensuring that millions of players
would imminently lose the ability to use Fortnite to connect with
their family and friends. Soon after, Epic filed its suit against
Apple challenging its monopoly on app stores and in-app purchases.
Less than twelve hours later, Apple notified Epic it was
terminating Epic from the Apple Developer Program, blocking <em>all</em>
Epic products from distribution through Apple’s App Store. Apple
specifically stated it would terminate Epic’s access to
development tools, including those necessary for Epic to keep
offering the world’s most popular graphics engine, the Unreal
Engine. The Unreal Engine is used to develop a wide array of
products including games, films, biomedical research and virtual
reality. Millions of developers rely on the Unreal Engine to
develop software, and hundreds of millions of consumers use that
software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a fascinating armchair quarterback game to speculate on what Epic anticipated from Apple as a reaction and what they didn’t. Pulling Fortnite from the App Store they obviously anticipated — Epic had both the lawsuit and 1984 ad parody ready to go. Revoking Epic’s developer account, I’m not so sure.</p>

<p>  “This gives customers another opportunity to protect their device and have access to all the AppleCare+ benefits,” Apple wrote in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg News. The company told employees the offer is available to customers who pay for AppleCare+ in full versus monthly payments, or for those that subscribe via installments on the Apple Card credit card.

    <p>Epic takes on Apple and Google’s dominance of smart phone app stores with an app update and corresponding legal filings and publicity campaign. What’s Apple’s next move, and more importantly, what do we wish Apple would do to change its App Store policies? Also, Apple releases a bundle with the promise for many more, which leads us to get a little bit sad about the state of Apple’s current service offerings.</p><p><a href="http://relay.fm/upgrade/311">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>

<p>Those rules are what is at stake here. So far, my argument that Apple was playing by the book is based on the notion that the book is accurate and can be trusted. Epic is arguing that these rules are deeply flawed and, to prove it, it is possible that it was <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1295444464085983235">forced to break the rules</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t absolve the company of rule-breaking; it&rsquo;s just that none of the effects of the last several days should be a surprise. Epic is probably right that Apple should have changed the App Store rules. What surprises me is that a company as notoriously controlling as Apple might be required to let lawyers and judges make those changes instead of doing so of its own volition.</p>

<p>I think the likely resolution of the standoff is that Epic relents in a couple of weeks time. They will retract the direct payments feature and Fortnite will then return to the App Store. The stunt has served its purpose as a mildly-embarrassing smear campaign against Apple, and its effect won&rsquo;t be lessened by Epic backtracking. In fact, that might only serve as legal ammo: Epic could argue that Apple&rsquo;s retaliatory action was so harsh that it left them no choice but to back down.</p>
<p>Assuming Apple sticks to its convictions, we must wait for some government body to enact change through an arduously long court and appeals process.</p>

<p>The money is one thing. Personally, I care more about reining in the power Apple has to deny entire categories of apps from existing.</p>

    <p>Suppose you have two sinusoidal functions with the same frequency ω but with different phases and different amplitudes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>A</em> sin(ω<em>t</em>)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>g(t</em>)<em> = B</em> sin(ω<em>t</em> + φ).</p>
<p>Then their sum is another sine wave with the same frequency</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>h(t</em>)<em> = C</em> sin(ω<em>t</em> + ψ).</p>
<p>Note that this includes cosines as a special case since a cosine is a sine with phase shift φ = 90°.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/sum_phase_shifted_sines.png" alt="Sum of two phase-shifted sine waves with the same frequency is another sine wave" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>This post will</p>
<ul>
<li>prove that the sum of sine waves is another sine wave,</li>
<li>show how to find its amplitude and phase, and</li>
<li>discuss the significance of this result in signal processing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding the amplitude and phase</h2>
<p>Note <em>f</em> + <em>g</em> and <em>h</em> both satisfy the second order differential equation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>y</em>&#8221; = &#8211; ω² <em>y</em></p>
<p>Therefore if they also satisfy the same initial conditions <em>y</em>(0) and <em>y</em>&#8216;(0) then they&#8217;re the same function.</p>
<p>The functions  <em>f</em> + <em>g</em> and <em>h</em> are equal at 0 if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>B</em> sin(φ) = <em>C </em>sin(ψ).</p>
<p>and their derivatives are equal at 0 if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">ω <em>A</em> + ω <em>B</em> cos(φ) = ω <em>C </em>cos(ψ).</p>
<p>Taking ratios says that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">tan(ψ) = <em>B</em> sin(φ) / (<em>A</em> + <em>B</em> cos(φ))</p>
<p>or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="border: 1px solid gray; padding: 5px;">ψ = arctan( <em>B</em> sin(φ) / (<em>A</em> + <em>B</em> cos(φ)) ).</span></p>
<p>Once we have ψ, we solve for <em>C</em> and find</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="border: 1px solid gray; padding: 5px;"><em>C = B</em> sin(φ) <em>/ </em>sin(ψ).</span></p>
<h3>Special case of sine and cosine</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the special case of φ = 90°, i.e. adding <em>A</em> sin(ω<em>t</em>) and <em>B</em> cos(ω<em>t</em>). Then sin(φ) = 1 and cos(φ) = 0, and the equation for ψ simplifies to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">ψ = arctan(<em>B</em>/<em>A</em>).</p>
<p>If an angle has tangent <em>B</em>/<em>A</em>, then it&#8217;s sine is <em>B</em> / √(<em>A</em>² + <em>B</em>²), and so we have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>C</em> = √(<em>A</em>² + <em>B</em>²).</p>
<h2>Linear time invariant (LTI) systems</h2>
<p>A linear, time-invariant system can differentiate or integrate signals. It can change their amplitude or phase. And it can add two signals together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see that changing the amplitude or phase of a signal doesn&#8217;t change its frequency. It&#8217;s also easy to see that differentiation and integration of sine waves doesn&#8217;t change their frequency. But it&#8217;s not as clear that adding two sines with the same frequency doesn&#8217;t change their frequency. Here we&#8217;ve shown that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p>Bode plots are a way to show how an LTI system changes in response to changes in its inputs. These plots show what happens to the amplitude and to the phase. They don&#8217;t need to show what happens to the frequency because the frequency doesn&#8217;t change.</p>

    <p>Acerbic YouTube take from Jim Sterling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screw the lot of them. Yes, Apple and Google need taking down from
their high towers. Yes, Epic Games has a point as it sues to keep
Fortnite on mobile devices. But absolutely all of them are as bad
as each other.</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>Kyle Orland, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most if not all of the complaints Epic makes against Apple and
Google seem to apply to Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo in the
console space as well. All three console makers also take a
30-percent cut of all microtransaction sales on their platforms,
for example. […]</p>

<p>On mobile platforms, Epic is calling the same kind of 30-percent
fee “exorbitant” and says it wants to offer a more direct payment
solution so it can “pass along the savings to players.” On
consoles, though, Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">happily introduced a permanent 20-percent
discount</a> on all microtransaction purchases, despite there
being no sign that the console makers have changed their fee
structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. This is exactly the point I’ve been trying to make since the Xbox Game Pass controversy last week. Microsoft wants Apple to allow on iOS something they themselves will not allow on Xbox.</p>

<p>If you think Epic is right in principle about iOS and Android, then they ought to be making the same argument about Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. A computer is a computer. “Consoles” are a business model and user experience design choice, and the iPhone and iPad are effectively <em>app</em> consoles, where games are just one type of app. It’s a shame (in more ways than this) that Apple TV isn’t a bigger player, because it’s just another variant of iOS.</p>

<p>But instead of fighting the game consoles, Epic is taking <em>more</em> of a hit: Fortnite players on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch get the 20 percent reduction in price <em>while Epic still pays</em> the 30 percent cut of each transaction to the platform vendor. It’s a stunt, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Orland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe Epic just has a better relationship with console makers
than mobile phone makers. […]  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/9/21318965/sony-epic-games-investment-fortnite-unreal-engine">Sony recently invested $250
million in Epic</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/behind-the-scenes-of-that-incredible-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo/">prominently featured Epic’s Unreal Engine
5</a> in a recent major PlayStation 5 promotional demo, too. Even
Nintendo, which traditionally uses its own technology for game
development, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/7/14533324/nintendo-switch-unreal-engine-miyamoto">has begun using Unreal Engine for its own titles in
recent years</a>. In a way, Epic can’t attack these platform
holders without also attacking itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure that has nothing to do with it.</p>

    <p>Similar opening statement to their suit against Apple, substituting “Don’t be evil” for “1984”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a
unique motto: “Don’t Be Evil”. Google’s Code of Conduct explained
that this admonishment was about “how we serve our users” and
“much more than that … it’s also about doing the right thing
more generally”. Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated
its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do
evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew
of markets it has grown to monopolize. This case is about doing
the right thing in one important area, the Android mobile
ecosystem, where Google unlawfully maintains monopolies in
multiple related markets, denying consumers the freedom to enjoy
their mobile devices — freedom that Google always promised
Android users would have.</p>

    <p>Google’s statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through
multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the
Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to
developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite
remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available
on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the
opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring
Fortnite back to Google Play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can still sideload Fortnite via direct download from Epic, or install it from Samsung’s Galaxy Store (which only works with Samsung devices).</p>

<p>Dieter Bohn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given Epic’s outsized response to Apple’s ban — the lawsuit and
the 1984 ad — it’s a sure bet that the company will have a
response to Google as well. We’ll obviously let you know what that
is when it happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, can’t wait for the slick Google ad parody that I’m sure Epic has already made and has been waiting all day to fire off. Holding my breath here.</p>

    <p>You’ll forgive the pun, but <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">Epic Games revealed an epic update to Fortnite for iOS today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and
Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct
payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment
processing savings to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What costs $10 through an App Store payment costs only $8 direct from Epic. (That’s not really passing the entirety of the savings to the user — Epic nets $7 from a $10 App Store in-app purchase, but minus credit card fees nets about $7.75 from an $8 direct payment. But, from a user’s perspective, it’s a 20 percent discount.)</p>

<p>Epic shipped this feature via an update that was delivered entirely through the Fortnite app itself, not through a new version of the app submitted through the App Store. And yes, this entire gambit is every bit as against the rules of the App Store as you think it is. Epic did this without any permission from Apple and without giving Apple any notice.</p>

<p>The only question was what Apple would do. If Apple decided to play on Easy mode, their move might have been to keep Fortnite in the App Store but stop accepting updates to the app. (But again, Fortnite shipped this particular feature without submitting a new version of the app itself.) Playing on Medium difficulty, which is what Apple chose, meant removing Fortnite — an immensely popular game — from the App Store.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-13"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-13">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here’s Apple’s statement, in its entirety, which they sent to multiple publications (including Daring Fireball) hours after Epic’s opening gambit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App
Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and
designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their
Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a
feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple,
and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store
guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer
who sells digital goods or services.</p>

<p>Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have
benefited from the App Store ecosystem — including it’s [<em>sic</em>]
tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all
developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines
freely and we’re glad they’ve built such a successful business on
the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead
them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact
that these guidelines create a level playing field for all
developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make
every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they
can return Fortnite to the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was very clear this morning that Epic knew exactly what it was doing, and how Apple was likely to respond. In very short order after Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store, <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1293994211621167105">Epic filed a lawsuit</a>, which opens guns-a-blazing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1984, the fledgling Apple computer company released the
Macintosh — the first mass-market, consumer-friendly home
computer. The product launch was announced with a breathtaking
advertisement evoking George Orwell’s 1984 that cast Apple as a
beneficial, revolutionary force breaking IBM’s monopoly over the
computing technology market. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs introduced
the first showing of the 1984 advertisement by explaining, “it
appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope
to offer IBM a run for its money…. Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was
George Orwell right about 1984?”</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020, and Apple has become what it once railed
against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block
competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more
powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the
monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion,
Apple’s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology
monopolist in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s filing wastes little time. By page 5 it reaches the point where they accuse Apple of “illegal restraints” that keep Epic from providing its own competing iOS app store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic — and Fortnite’s users — are directly harmed by Apple’s
anti-competitive conduct. But for Apple’s illegal restraints,
Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which
would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated
store and would provide users the choice to use Epic’s or another
third-party’s in-app payment processing tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear, of course, what Epic <em>actually</em> hopes to get from Apple, either voluntarily or forced by the courts, but they’re asking for the whole shebang: they’re claiming it is illegal for iOS not to be as open to native third-party software as the Mac.</p>

<p>Epic also had a new commercial queued up that makes their argument much more artfully — it’s a strident parody of Apple’s iconic “1984” spot, with the obvious but still clever title <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4">Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite</a></em>. You really have to see it — Fortnite has a fun strong brand and they poured that into this. It closes with this title card:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation,
Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight
to stop 2020 from becoming “1984”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a preaching-to-the-choir aspect to Epic’s entire campaign, though. Both the ad and the legal filing seem directed toward an audience that enjoys decals of Calvin pissing on the Apple logo. The ad is in some ways a deft parody, and it is very saucy, but one thing it is not is funny.</p>

<p>Epic, in a very savvy way, is waging this war as much or more in the court of public opinion as they are in any court of law. And, ultimately, Apple stands to lose more in brand equity than in dollars, no matter how this turns out.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1-2020-08-13">
<p>Playing on Hard mode would be Apple flipping the kill switch to disable already-installed copies of Fortnite on iOS devices. I don’t think that was on the table as Apple’s opening move, and even now that Epic has revealed itself to be playing hardball, it would be heavy-handed, to say the least. What makes this a fair fight is that Fortnite is already installed on so many millions of iOS devices. Popularity is power. Removing Fortnite from the App Store (which, again, also blocks existing users from getting app updates) is a big move, but most iOS users who are in Fortnite’s target audience already have it installed. That’s not tenable in the long run, but it gives Epic and Apple time to spar without disrupting existing iOS Fortnite users from continuing to play.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-13"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

  It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of iPod Software—my boss’s boss—abruptly entered and closed the door behind him. He cut to the chase. &#8220;I have a special assignment for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod. Report only to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>  The next day, the receptionist called to tell me that two men were waiting in the lobby. I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew, the engineers who would actually build this custom iPod. I’d love to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats and were glancing in window reflections to make sure they hadn’t been tailed, but they were perfectly normal thirty-something engineers. I signed them in, and we went to a conference room to talk.

<p>They didn&rsquo;t actually work for the Department of Energy; they worked for a division of Bechtel, a large US defense contractor to the Department of Energy.  They wanted to add some custom hardware to an iPod and record data from this custom hardware to the iPod&rsquo;s disk in a way that couldn&rsquo;t be easily detected. But it still had to look and work like a normal iPod.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Finally, the iPod team developed on Windows computers. Apple didn&rsquo;t have working ARM developer tools yet, because this was before the iPhone shipped. The iPod team used ARM developer tools from ARM Ltd, which ran only on Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We discussed the best way to hide the data they recorded. As a disk engineer, I suggested they make another partition on the disk to store their data. That way, even if someone plugged the modified iPod into a Mac or PC, iTunes would treat it as a normal iPod, and it would look like a normal iPod in the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer. They liked that, and a hidden partition it was.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Starting with the iPod nano, the operating system was signed with a digital signature to block the Linux hackers (and others). The boot ROM checked the digital signature before loading the operating system; if it didn&rsquo;t match, it wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In debt with student loans, Fran joined IBM Research in Poughkeepsie, NY as a programmer on July 15, 1957, where she taught incoming employees the basics of FORTRAN.  She planned to stay only until her debts were paid, however, she ended up spending her entire career at IBM.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>This work led to Fran&rsquo;s seminal paper on Program Optimization, first published in 1966, describing a robust new framework for implementing program analysis and optimization as well as a powerful set of new algorithms. Fran&rsquo;s 1970 paper on Control Flow analysis introduced the notion of &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; and node dominance relations, important improvements over the control flow abstractions given in her earlier paper. Her 1972 paper, &ldquo;A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,&rdquo; identified and discussed many of the transformations commonly used today.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Unlike many of my fellow liberals, I don&#8217;t consider the post office to be the very sinew upon which our nation rests. On the other hand, it <em>is</em> important and it&#8217;s worth running properly.</p>
<p>Now, there are plenty of reasonable disagreements about how the post office should be run, but there&#8217;s one issue that seems almost indisputable to me: it should be able to set postage rates that allow it to break even. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Accountability_and_Enhancement_Act">federal law</a> allows the price of first class stamps to rise only at the rate of inflation, and that&#8217;s plainly not enough in an era of email, Instagram, and falling volumes of first class mail. The German post office surveys European postage rates every few years, <a href="https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/media-relations/documents/2020/dp-letter-prices-in-europe-2020.pdf">and here&#8217;s how we compare:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859603"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859603" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_first_class_stamp.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="627"></figure>
<p>I think we can all agree that four bucks to send a letter in Denmark seems fairly outlandish, but we can also agree that the current US rate of 55 cents is pretty obviously an outlier too. We have economies of scale, to be sure, but we also have a far bigger landmass to cover than any European country.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem with the Postal Service. Congress wants to look good, so they pass a law keeping postage rates down. Then, when the Postal Service runs deficit after deficit, they swoop in and insist that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re run inefficiently. After all, it couldn&#8217;t possibly be Congress&#8217;s fault, could it?</p>
<p>It could be and it is. The Postal Regulatory Commission has been trying to get the inflation rule changed for some time, but so far they&#8217;ve had no luck. Apparently no one in Congress wants to be known as the person who voted to increase the price of a stamp.</p>
<p>When it comes to packages, the Postal Service has competition and therefore sets rates that allow it to compete. That keeps package rates reasonable. However, there&#8217;s no similar competitive pressure on letters since the Postal Service has a monopoly on first class mail. This means there really does need to be some kind of oversight on first class postage rates in order to prevent us from turning into Denmark. The problem is that a simpleminded inflation rule is about the worst possible oversight you can imagine. It needs to change, and if it does, guess what? Suddenly the USPS would be in perfectly good shape even if first class postage remained lower than practically any country in Europe. If we really value the Postal Service, this would be the single best way to show it.</p>

    <div class="podcastlinks"><a href="https://stratechery.com/podcasts/">Manage your Stratechery subscription.</a></div>
<p>Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.pdf?ts=1597165378">last week&#8217;s decision</a> by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing the District Court&#8217;s ruling that Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust violations, opened her opinion thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This case asks us to draw the line between anticompetitive behavior, which is illegal under federal antitrust law, and hypercompetitive behavior, which is not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, admittedly, a distinction I have not seen before, but it is perhaps a useful one, for the simple reason that being a successful business by definition means being anticompetitive: without some sort of differentiation and/or superior cost structure any sort of margin a business has will be competed away, and so preserving that differentiation and/or cost structure — being anticompetitive — should be the goal of any business. The distinction Callahan was drawing, though, is necessary if you interpret &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; as being &#8220;illegal&#8221;: businesses should compete, but they should not break the law along the way.</p>
<p>What makes this distinction particularly challenging is that the question as to what is anticompetitive and what is simply good business changes as a business scales. A small business can generally be as anticompetitive as it wants to be, while a much larger business is much more constrained in how anticompetitively it can act (as a quick aside, for the first part of this essay I am painting in broad strokes as far as questions of specific legality go). The specific case of Apple and the iPhone raises an additional angle: should the importance of the market in the question make a difference as well?</p>
<h4>Apple&#8217;s Vertical Integration</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s business model, which <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">uses software to differentiate hardware</a>, is designed to be anticompetitive. The company has traditionally made its money by selling physical devices which run Apple&#8217;s proprietary operating systems; its device-manufacturing competitors, meanwhile, have had to rely on an operating system that they could license, primarily Windows for PCs, and Android for mobile devices. They cannot license macOS or iOS.</p>
<p>What is funny about calling this strategy &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; is that it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that most pundits were sure Apple was anti-competing themselves into the ground. When Stratechery started in 2013, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-being-greedy-2013-9">media was filled</a> with predictions of the iPhone&#8217;s imminent demise at the hands of Android: there were simply too many other manufacturers making too many smartphones at too many price points that Apple could not or would not match, which would inevitably lead to developers fleeing iOS and Apple fighting for its life.</p>
<p>The problem with these predictions, as I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</a>, is that they drastically undervalued the experience of using Apple&#8217;s integrated products.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The business buyer, famously, does not care about the user experience. They are not the user, and so items that change how a product feels or that eliminate small annoyances simply don’t make it into their rational decision making process. Again, though, Christensen’s research is tilted towards business buyers. Critically, this includes the PC. For the most of its history, the vast majority of PC purchasers have been businesses, who have bought PCs on speeds, feeds, and ultimately, price…
</p></blockquote>
<p>I attributed Apple&#8217;s ability to eliminate many of those small annoyances to its vertical integration, which had long been out of fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The traditional business theory about vertical integration rests on the costs and controls…The issue I have with this analysis of vertical integration…is that the only considered costs are financial. But there are other, more difficult to quantify costs. Modularization incurs costs in the design and experience of using products that cannot be overcome, yet cannot be measured. Business buyers — and the analysts who study them — simply ignore them, but consumers don’t. Some consumers inherently know and value quality, look-and-feel, and attention to detail, and are willing to pay a premium that far exceeds the financial costs of being vertically integrated.

<p>One thing that is worth noting is that Apple has only ever integrated part of its value chain, particularly once it started manufacturing in China. A Mac, for example, looks something like this:</p>

<p>In this view Apple integrates hardware made with industry-standard components and macOS, providing a platform for even more app developers. Of course, this view of the Mac will soon be obsolete: Apple computers will soon come with Apple&#8217;s own chips, which is to say that the company is backward-integrating into one of its most important components. This is, as far as I can tell, seen as a good thing: Apple has both demonstrated its ability to build fast chips and to integrate those chips with its operating system; no one feels especially bad for Intel, particularly since the company had its own near-monopoly for decades.</p>
<h4>App Store Integration</h4>
<p>Of course iPhones have already been using Apple&#8217;s own chips for a decade; what has always made the iPhone different than the Mac, though, is the degree to which Apple has forward-integrated into the app ecosystem. What is critical to understand is that this integration proceeded in parts, and that those parts build on each other.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part One: Installation</strong></p>
<p>Start with app installation: because Apple controls the operating system, it controls what apps can or cannot be installed on the device. iOS will only run apps that have permission from Apple (this permission is ultimately enforced by Apple&#8217;s hardware), and Apple grants this permission via the App Store. To put it in the context of the value chain, Apple leverages its integration of hardware and software to control app installation:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png" alt="iOS integrated app installation" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5224" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-300x266.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-768x680.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It is essential to note that this forward integration has had huge benefits for everyone involved. While Apple pretends like <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1288297750690328576">the Internet never existed as a distribution channel</a>, the truth is it was a channel that wasn&#8217;t great for a lot of users: people were scared to install apps, convinced they would mess up their computers, get ripped off, or accidentally install a virus.</p>
<p>The App Store changed all of that: Apple effectively extended the trust it had earned with users over the years to all developers in the App Store. Users could install whatever they wanted, confident the app would not mess up their phone, rip them off, or be a virus. This by extension meant that the addressable market was far larger for app developers than the PC was, even though it would be several years before smartphones had a larger installed base than PCs. And this, of course, brought benefits to Apple:</p>

<p>This was the combination of integration and modularity at its absolute best: Apple leveraged its control to create a better market that benefited everyone.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Two: Payment Processing</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Apple controlled app installation, it was a natural extension into payment processing, particularly since the App Store was built on the same infrastructure as iTunes.</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png" alt="App installation integrated payment processing" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5223" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, like iTunes at the time, payment processing functionality was limited to up-front purchases. Suppose you wanted Super Monkey Ball: you had to pay $9.99 to even download the app; there were no trials or in-app purchases:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/10-years-of-app-store-a-timeline-of-changes/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png" alt="The original App Store" width="436" height="653" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5222" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png 684w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-200x300.png 200w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-768x1150.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-421x630.png 421w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996.png 873w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>From the beginning Apple kept 30% of every purchase; that was similar to the rate <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117340340327331757">the company kept for iTunes purchases</a>, and perhaps more pertinently, just barely covered credit card processing fees for a $0.99 app.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_0_5217" id="identifier_0_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Credit card processing fees generally consist of a fixed fee between $0.25 and $0.30 per transaction, plus 1.5%~3.0%; Apple of course would have had a significant volume discount.">1</a></p>
<p>This gets at why this was another great deal for everyone involved: most users had already trusted Apple with their credit card information, and again, Apple was extending that trust to every developer in its App Store, making it far more likely that developers would earn money on their apps than if they had to drive downloads and purchases on their own. And once again, this circled back to Apple&#8217;s benefit, both in terms of the ecosystem broadly and, as the App Store reached scale (and added in-app purchasing), real profits.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Three: Customer Management</strong></p>
<p>That Apple has controlled app installation and payment processing from the beginning is an obvious point; what is less appreciated is that Apple leveraged its control of payment processing, which was based on its control of app installation, which was based on its control of the operating system, into complete ownership of the customer relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png" alt="Payment processing integrated the customer relationship" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5225" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Users didn&#8217;t pay developers, they paid Apple, who paid developers. Users didn&#8217;t get receipts from developers, they got receipts from Apple, who kept their email addresses for themselves. This did have some user benefits, particularly in terms of ensuring their data was not sold to unscrupulous data brokers, but the benefit to developers was much less clear cut. There remains no means to offer refunds, for example, and for many years developers could not respond to negative reviews in the App Store.</p>
<p>What was most frustrating for developers, though, was that the lack of a customer relationship, in conjunction with the lack of functionality for upgrade pricing, made it difficult to build sustainable businesses in product spaces that did not have an obvious service component (which might require a subscription) or consumables (which could be bought with in-app purchases). The App Store was about transactions, not relationships, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">Apple liked it that way</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>These three distinct integrations, each of which built on the previous, were present in the App Store from Day One — and Steve Jobs knew it. He articulated what just took me 700 words in a crisp five minutes and seven seconds:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_1_5217" id="identifier_1_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Although I can&rsquo;t help but note that 2:30 mark has a very rare Apple presentation error: the Backgammon game should be on the iPhone screen">2</a></p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-s6wdT7tS-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-s6wdT7tS-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store</p></video></div></div>
<p>Everything about this video was exceptional at the time, and just as critically, nothing was objectionable. After all, the iPhone was still a small business; from a developer perspective, the App Store was (almost) all upside. It would be users who would vote with their wallets in favor of Apple&#8217;s approach.</p>
<h4>App Store Problems</h4>
<p>There is a bit of a running joke in tech that the mainstream media believes that every tech company is ridiculously over-valued right up until the day that the exact same company is a juggernaut that is killing industries; in the case of Apple, the company&#8217;s strategy was doomed right up until it was illegal, or so it seems with the App Store.</p>
<p>In truth, though, while many of the issues surrounding the App Store are about Apple being a whole lot bigger than they were in 2008, the company has, particularly over the last few years, extended its control further and further away from the core integration that undergirds its business.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the company required that apps that utilize third-party login services also utilize &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; (which had to be at the top of the list). This, by extension, meant that cross-platform apps and services had to integrate &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; into their Android and web apps. This was in part a further assumption of customer management, and also an extension of control beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s control of the customer relationship has also helped sustain its control of payment processing; after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller">Amazon advertised that Kindle books were available on all platforms</a> Apple forced the bookseller to stop selling books in its app. Moreover, Amazon couldn&#8217;t even <em>tell</em> users to visit Amazon.com, much less offer a link or, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apple-app-store-follow-up-aws-arm-servers-intels-impending-choice/">as Android allows</a>, a webview of the store.</p>
<p>What is troubling about this example, which also applies to Netflix, Spotify, and other so-called &#8220;Reader&#8221; apps, is that Apple&#8217;s aggressive integration up the stack isn&#8217;t really helping anyone. Users are confused, these big developers get fewer customers than they might have otherwise, while Apple&#8217;s overall iPhone experience is degraded. The ones that really lose out, though, are smaller developers whose cost structures cannot support Apple&#8217;s 30% cut, yet don&#8217;t have the brand awareness to enable customers to find their websites. In this way Apple is actually making dominant companies even stronger (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/">much like they are Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Apple also appears to be making an effort to limit this exception; while Basecamp managed to drive Apple to a face-saving retreat from its insistence on in-app purchase for its Hey email service, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/">I heard from many developers</a> that App Store review had started rejecting apps that had been in the store for years because they only allowed users to subscribe on the web.</p>
<p>What was particularly disappointing about these shakedowns, though, is that Apple itself admitted <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-reveals-new-developer-technologies-to-foster-the-next-generation-of-apps/">in a press release</a> that it had been holding up bug fixes in App Review &#8220;over guideline violations&#8221;, many of which were about driving usage of its own payment processor. This is truly an inversion of the win-win-win dynamic that characterized the company&#8217;s previous integration efforts: now users were being put at risk for bugs developers were liable for because of arbitrary reasons related to Apple&#8217;s drive for Services revenue.</p>
<p>Of course Apple had long put users at risk in other ways; the company had turned a blind eye to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/dependent-digital-whales/">the search for digital whales</a> who would spend huge amounts of money on games they could never win. This was, in retrospect, the canary in the coal mine about the corrupting power of the App Store: Apple had started out bragging how they would protect users, but the company seemed far more concerned about protecting its bottom line.</p>
<p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple&#8217;s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn&#8217;t support traditional trials<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_2_5217" id="identifier_2_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You can trial a subscription only">3</a> or upgrades, the importance of which I&#8217;ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>For me this is the biggest disappointment. I have long believed that the Internet is going to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">fundamentally remake all aspects of society</a>, including the economy, and that one area of immense promise is small-scale entrepreneurship. The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p>
<p>All that noted, what does remain valuable is Apple&#8217;s total control of the installation process. The iPhone is probably the most valuable target on earth for scams and hackers, and while <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/">vulnerabilities have been exploited</a>, there is no denying the fact that users are safer on iOS than they are on other platforms, and that is valuable to everyone involved.</p>
<h4>The Epic Lawsuit</h4>
<p>All of this explains why I find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">Epic&#8217;s lawsuit against Apple</a>, which was filed last Thursday after the company updated Fortnite to include an alternate payment system, and was promptly kicked out of the store by Apple, such a bummer.</p>
<p>Epic is attacking every level of the iPhone stack: the company doesn&#8217;t just want a direct relationship with customers, and it doesn&#8217;t just want to use its own payment processor; it is also demanding the right to run its own App Store. There is precedent on the PC: there Epic has built a rival to Steam that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">has benefited gamers most of all</a>; at the same time, the PC has always been completely open, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>My preferred outcome would see Apple maintaining its control of app installation. I treasure and depend on the openness of PCs and Macs, but I am also relieved that the iPhone is so dependable for those less technically savvy than me. What would be a far better outcome, at least from my perspective, would be Apple remembering that those same users that benefit from the iPhone being locked down should be the focus everywhere.</p>
<p>That means, for example, allowing purchases via webviews, particularly for products and experiences that do not have zero marginal costs. Sure, that could mean less App Store revenue in the short run, but Apple would be well-served having to build more and better products to win developers over. At the end of the day, squeezing businesses that can stomach the cost of Apple development, both in terms of implementing in-app purchase and that 30%, by definition has less ultimate upside than growing the pie for everyone.</p>
<p>This lawsuit is also a reminder that Apple has a lot to lose. While the most likely outcome is an Apple victory — the Supreme Court has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-response-to-hey-heys-response-to-apple-heys-limited-antitrust-options/">pretty consistent</a> in holding that companies do not have a &#8220;duty to deal&#8221; — every decision the company makes that favors only itself, and not society generally, is an invitation to examine just how important the iPhone is to, well, everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the most frustrating aspect of this debate: Apple consistently acts like a company peeved it is not getting its fair share, somehow ignoring the fact it is worth nearly $2 trillion precisely because the iPhone matters more than anything. This is not a console you play on to entertain yourself, or even a PC for work: it is the foundation of modern life, which makes it all the more disappointing that Apple seems to care more about its short term bottom line than it does about the users and developers that used to share in its integration upside; if Apple doesn&#8217;t change course, hyperessential will at some point trump hypercompetitive.</p>

Apple TV+ subscribers can now subscribe to a bundle of CBS All Access and SHOWTIME for just $9.99 per month following a 7-day free trial. When subscribed to separately, these two channels together would cost $20.98 per month, making this a substantial offer.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple&rsquo;s press release highlights some of the features that make channel subscriptions appealing:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  By subscribing through Apple TV channels, customers can watch content from all three services online and offline, ad-free and on demand, only on the Apple TV app. Through Family Sharing, up to six family members can share the subscriptions to Apple TV+, CBS All Access, and SHOWTIME using just their personal Apple ID and password.

<p id="p5">As someone who has used Apple&rsquo;s TV app heavily for years, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-tv-channels-a-great-tv-experience-thats-failing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">written before</a> about how much value I find in the channels experience, and how disappointed I am that Apple hasn&rsquo;t been able to strike more deals for additional channels partners. When Apple TV channels first launched in early 2019, HBO was the most prestigious channel available, but when that service transitioned to become HBO Max, there was no longer a channel option available for Apple users. New streaming services like Disney+ and Peacock haven&rsquo;t been made available as channels either. So Apple has built a solid TV experience for the streaming age, but it&rsquo;s not available for the services people care about most. I&rsquo;m not particularly hopeful that today&rsquo;s bundle news will change that at all, but it&rsquo;s good to at least see a little life from the company&rsquo;s channels initiative.</p>

    <p>It’s 2020, and Apple is shipping a <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1219299028791226368">rack-mountable Mac Pro</a>. It’s the latest chapter in a decades-long flirtation between Apple and the machines that dwell in the server closet. Even though the Mac Pro is rack-mountable, Apple can’t quite see it as a server—<a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1217136324219568128">you can’t buy it without a mouse and keyboard</a>. Instead, the company seems content to let individual users and dedicated third parties like MacStadium do the work of taking Mac workstations and treating them like they belong in a server rack.</p>
<p>This is a subject that’s close to my heart. I’ve only had my name on a single printed book and it was called “<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/providing-internet-services-via-the-mac-os/oclc/34243972">Providing Internet Services via the Mac OS</a>,” and told you everything you needed to know to turn a Mac running Classic Mac OS into a server. (Yes, that was a thing that we did back then.) From the mid-90s through the early 2000s, I had a series of Macs running classic Mac OS in my closet that acted as web, email, FTP, and database servers. Here’s to the crazy ones, I guess.</p>
<p>Apple has always been a consumer hardware company through and through, not a company that makes servers or speaks to an audience of IT people and network managers. But that hasn’t stopped it from trying. In the ’90s, Apple would rebadge Power Macs as Apple Workgroup Servers, bundling them with extra hardware and software.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Shiner. (Not a Mac.)</figcaption></figure><p>I started covering Apple in the mid-90s, and let me tell you, that particular version of Apple was extremely weird, as epitomized by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsVAdrdkyoA">Apple Network Server</a>, code-named Shiner.</p>
<p>Shiner was not a Mac. Shiner was a PowerPC-based server that cost between $11,000 and $15,000, and ran IBM’s version of UNIX known as AIX—which you needed to buy separately, for an additional $1,600. It was delayed several times, as its competitive advantage over PCs running Novell NetWare continued to dissipate. Robert Hess of MacWEEK wrote in 1995 that Apple had “missed its window of opportunity.” Reviews were positive, but tempered with a skepticism (later proven right) that Apple would actually commit to making a line of Unix-based servers.</p>
<p>Like most mid-90s Apple products, Shiner was killed off in 1997 as Apple was gripped by its near-death experience. “I look at that as a dream when Apple was in a coma,” Steve Jobs later said, while insisting that what would come next would be entirely different.</p>
<p>In fact,  the arrival of Jobs actually planted the seed of Apple’s next attempt to fit in a server rack: NextStep, the operating system that would evolve into Mac OS X, was based on Unix. The door was open for a Mac to be a real live Unix-based server and it took Apple almost no time to build its own server hardware.</p>
<p>It was OS X. On a server. It was Xserve. Pronounced like the letter, not the roman numeral. No, I don’t know why. Apple did stuff like that back in 2002.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06-xserve_front.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Steve Jobs and Jony Ive era of Apple was a design heyday when Apple created many interesting, clever, and influential products. The Xserve was… not that. It was most definitely the sign of a design team trying to figure out how to add some flair and creativity to a place—the server rack—that did not care one bit about either of those.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08-xserve_rack.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve was designed to live in the server rack.</figcaption></figure><p>Sized specifically for server racks, it was what’s called a 1U server, meaning it was a single unit high—so 1.75 inches thick, to go with the dimensions of a 19-inch equipment rack. Those dimensions are unusually large for a Mac: 18 inches wide and 28 inches deep. This was not a pizza box. This was an extra-extra-large, party-size pizza box.</p>
<p>Apple has frequently struggled between its instinct to create beautiful designs and designs that make its products more functional. Some of Apple’s worst design missteps have come because looks were prioritized over usability. (Feel free to think of your favorite example now. I’m imagining a round Mac Pro and an ultra-thin keyboard with no key travel.)</p>
<p>Xserve, then, was a real design challenge. How do you take pride in creating something for a server rack, the most utilitarian of environments? I’m not here to tell you Xserve was pretty, because it wasn’t. But it’s clear Apple’s designers struggled mightily to give it a little extra something.</p>
<p>The pretty stuff was on the front—fitting, since that’s really the only part you could see. There were shiny buttons, a FireWire 400 port, a slimline CD-ROM drive, and four hot-swappable hard drive modules. Press the front of a module and once the drive dismounted, a light appeared, indicating it was safe to remove the disk.</p>
<p>The back side featured a standard array of ports for the time, room for ports from three expansion cards, and the notably weird PC-standard DB-9 serial port. The idea was that you could connect to the Xserve and gain command-line access via serial, even if it wasn’t on your network. It’s a choice that makes sense for a server, but it’s pretty wacky for a Mac.</p>
<p>There was so much room inside that Xserve case that Apple designed it with two fans. The idea was that if one fan became less capable, the other fan would adjust to compensate—and if you needed to swap a fan out, you could do so without shutting the computer down.</p>
<p>Those fans are another of the Xserve’s unusual qualities: This is undoubtedly, indisputably the loudest Mac ever made. If people thought they could tuck these in a server rack in their quiet studio space, they were wrong… those fans <em>howled</em>. This was a server designed to be put away in a closet or server installation.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-xserveraid_3q.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve RAID.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xserve also inspired the creation of one of Apple’s most unusual Mac accessories this side of the Duo Dock: The Xserve RAID. This was a 3U high 14-disk hard drive array with a design to match the Xserve.</p>
<p>The early 2000s were an era when Apple was so excited by the prospect of Mac OS X’s Unix underpinnings that it designed a rack-mountable Mac server and a 14-disk RAID system. “We have a lot to learn, but I think we’re going to learn fast, and learn by working with some great customers,” Jobs said on the day of the Xserve’s unveiling. But by the end of the decade it was clear that this was an area best served by other companies—not Apple.</p>
<p>Over the decades, Apple’s instinct for identifying the core of its business has been good, but there have been exceptions at the fringes. It created Aperture thinking it would take on Adobe for the high-end photography market… and then thought better of it.</p>
<p>Xserve is a similar example. The company saw a niche market where it could make something cooler and better and more cutting edge. But every other strategic decision Apple made during that era was in the service of its core business of making personal computers. Xserve survived eight years, including the transition to Intel, but it could not have been a hard decision for Apple to discontinue it and steer people who needed Mac servers to the Mac Pro and Mac mini.</p>
<p>Mac servers never died. They’re still all over the place, operated by people who are more comfortable with macOS than the alternatives. I’ve had a Mac mini running as a server in my house since the first one arrived on the scene. And yes, that rack-mountable Mac Pro is now available.</p>
<p>But the Xserve will always stand alone. It was the only Mac made specifically for that equipment rack. I’d ask for us to take a moment of silence to remember it, but you wouldn’t be able to hear yourself think over the fan noise.</p>

    <p>Though it might still only be mid-August, fall is rapidly approaching. That’s not only significant because it will hopefully mean the end of the heat that’s been barraging my home for the last several weeks, but also because it’s traditionally Apple’s busiest time of the year.</p>
<p>I say “traditionally” because this year, well, everything’s a little bit off-kilter. Still, it does seem as though the Cupertino-based company is getting its ducks in a row for its usual deluge of product releases, even if the actual event might look more like this year’s WWDC keynote than fall Apple events of years past.</p>
<p>So, in advance of everything kicking off, let’s take a moment to go over what might be the most exciting announcements to come out of Apple Park in the next few months, and what we all might have to look forward to. (Because, in this day and age, we all need <em>something</em> to look forward to, don’t we?)</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3571456/whats-in-store-and-in-stores-for-apple-this-fall.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

I didn’t ask the clerk at Barnes &amp; Noble what channel she watched the speech on her new TV. It was none of my business, like a bunch of other things that were none of my business when she sold me my copy of<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Harris’ memoir.</a> The important thing to her was that she had a new TV.</span></h5>
<p>The clerk who rang up my copy of Kamala Harris’ memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Truths We Hold”</a>, was a short, thin, white woman about my age, with wire framed glasses, dark graying hair haphazardly pinned back from her heart shaped face, her eyes smiling brightly over her surgical blue cloth mask. Her eyes got brighter as she slid the book under the plexiglass. “Did you see her speech?”</p>
<p>Her tone suggested she had and it had made her an enthusiastic Harris fan, if she wasn’t one already. It also suggested I must be one too. Why else would I be buying the book?</p>
<p>“I saw part of it. I came in late,” I said regretfully. I didn’t get into the problems I’d had getting it to stream on my computer. “I heard the best part was the beginning when she talked about her friendship with Beau.”</p>
<p>She assured me it was a nice tribute. I told her I hadn’t known they were friends. If I had I would have believed she was a lock for the nomination. “I don’t much about him,” she said apologetically. I resisted the temptation to mansplain the man. I said, &quot;I think there&#39;s a section in the book dealing with him and their friendship,&quot; and left it at that. She said she looked forward to reading it. I asked for her impression of the whole speech but it turned out there was something she was more excited about than the speech itself---that <em>she had been able to watch it.</em> “I just got a TV!” she practically burbled. “It’s my first.”</p>
<p>This threw me a bit. A fellow boomer and it’s her first TV? I went quickly through the possibilities. She meant it was the first TV that was all her own? All her previous TVs she’d shared with her family, roommates, partner or spouse? That raised questions about her living arrangements and what became of the “owner” of the old TV, questions that were none of my business. Or was she one of those people who had not wanted a TV or hadn’t been able to afford one when she’d set out on her own and found she got along fine without one? So then, why had she decided to get one now? Had she inherited it? From whom and under what circumstances? Again, not my business. So I said, “Just in time for the convention.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait!” she said.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope it’s all good news from here on out.”</p>
<p>“If it’s not,” she said, still cheerful but with a note of steely determination, “it’s going right back!”</p>
