<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been less than a year since Apple launched <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-web-based-music-app-as-public-beta/" rel="noopener noreferrer">its first public beta of the Apple Music web player</a>, which after several months came out of beta earlier this year and resides at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>. On the heels of an updated Music app in this fall&rsquo;s releases of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and more, the company isn&rsquo;t delaying keeping its web player in-sync with the app versions. A new public beta of Apple Music for web can be accessed now at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, sporting a design to match the changes seen in the forthcoming macOS 11 and iPadOS 14, and a new Listen Now page that replaces the prior For You option.</p>
<p id="p3">The design refresh doesn&rsquo;t bring major changes, just aesthetic tweaks to elements like the sidebar. Listen Now represents the most substantial update, but it still works similarly to the former For You page. It contains collections of recommended albums and playlists based on your listening activity, alongside Apple Music&rsquo;s algorithmic playlists like New Music Mix and Chill Mix. You&rsquo;ll also find Recently Played, New Releases from artists in your Library, and a new prominent section called Top Picks. After using Listen Now in the OS betas for the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve grown to prefer it over For You, despite there being relatively few differences between the two. Having Top Picks front and center, for example, is a better choice for me than For You&rsquo;s placement of the algorithmic playlists up top, since I rarely listen to those.</p>
<p id="p4">It&rsquo;s great to see that Apple Music&rsquo;s web player will be updated on the same cycle as its apps. Apple&rsquo;s history with iterating its web apps isn&rsquo;t great (iCloud.com, anyone?), but to better compete against Spotify, which has a first-class web player, a more intentional approach for Apple Music is needed.</p>
<p id="p5">Anyone can access the beta version of Apple Music&rsquo;s web player at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, while the previous version is still accessible at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Theodore Schleifer says that the tech community will be happy with Joe Biden&#8217;s choice of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/11/21364027/kamala-harris-joe-biden-vice-president-silicon-valley-donors-tech">Kamala Harris as his running mate:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooper Teboe, a top Democratic fundraiser in Silicon Valley, <strong>said about one-third of major West Coast donors that he’s spoken to have been waiting to see who Biden would choose as vice president before deciding whether to invest tens of thousands of dollars into Democrats this cycle.</strong> Should Biden have chosen Warren, for instance, tech donors might’ve had concerns.</p>
<p>“She is the safest pick for the donor community,” Teboe said of Harris. “She will be the pick that the California, Silicon Valley donor community — who are worried about things like tech and repatriation and taxes and so on and so forth — she is the pick that they will be happiest with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? A full third of these geniuses were holding off because they first wanted to know who Biden&#8217;s VP would be? Don&#8217;t they know that veeps have no real influence on policy at all? It&#8217;s hardly a big secret.</p>
<p>This just confirms the general sense I&#8217;ve always gotten that Silicon Valley folks are surprisingly ignorant of even the basics of politics. It&#8217;s easy to make some snarky point about this and then move on, but it&#8217;s genuinely kind of mysterious. I suppose they so desperately wish politics didn&#8217;t exist that they just wall themselves off from it.</p>

    <p>Justin Kroll and Mike Fleming Jr., reporting for Deadline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two and one-half months after it stepped up to become the
producers of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, Apple has inked a
first-look deal with its director, Martin Scorsese. The master
filmmaker will base his Sikelia Productions banner at Apple in a
multi-year deal for film and television projects Scorsese will
produce and direct for Apple TV +.</p>

<p>The relationship kicks off with <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, the
Eric Roth-scripted adaptation of the David Grann non-fiction book
which will star Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro will star in.
Apple won an auction with the $180 million+ film originally
optioned by Paramount came back on the market. Deadline revealed
on May 27 that Apple won a deal that has Paramount releasing the
film theatrically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to apply Apple’s “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">the best, not the most</a>” mantra to Hollywood would be signing more deals like this. Apple TV+ will never have the most exclusive movies and TV shows, but it can have a large share of the <em>best</em> ones.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Tripp Mickle wrote a long feature for The Wall Street Journal, “How Tim Cook Made Apple His Own” (<a href="https://apple.news/Azb-hAvJuS4yr89Cy8Pccog">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Steve Jobs’s death, Silicon Valley anticipated Apple Inc.’s
business would falter. Wall Street fretted about the road ahead.
And loyal customers agonized about the future of a beloved product
innovator.</p>

<p>Today, Apple shares are at record highs. The company’s market
valuation is $1.9 trillion — bigger than the GDP of Canada,
Russia or Spain. And Apple, now the world’s largest company,
continues to dominate the smartphone market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good and mostly fair lede. But I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that “loyal customers agonized about the future”. Where’s the evidence of that? I’d say the group that’s missing after Silicon Valley (which believes strongly, justifiably in most cases, in the importance of founders) and Wall Street are business reporters. It wasn’t so much much investors as the business media who predicted “can’t innovate without Steve Jobs” doom for Apple.</p>

<p>The feature is largely fair though, and it does read like Mickle tried very hard to get people who know Cook to talk about him. But, well, very few of them did, and those who did don’t seem to know him all that well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Cook is described by colleagues and acquaintances as a humble
workaholic with a singular commitment to Apple. Longtime
colleagues seldom socialized with him, and assistants said he kept
his calendar clear of personal events.</p>

<p>Around Thanksgiving two years ago, guests saw him dining by
himself at the secluded Amangiri Hotel near Zion National Park.
When a guest later bumped into him, he said he came to the hotel
to recharge after a hectic fall punctuated by the rollout of
Apple’s latest iPhone. “They have the best masseuses in the world
here,” he said, the guest recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Mickle’s source is a random guest who recognized Cook at a hotel.</p>

<p>It’s sort of inside baseball, but this paragraph is my favorite from the whole piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple declined to make Mr. Cook or any of its executives
available. Instead, the company helped arrange calls with four
people it said could speak to areas of importance to Mr. Cook such
as environmentalism, education and health. None of the four said
they knew him well. One had never met him, another met him only in
passing, a third spent half an hour with him and a fourth spent a
few hours with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean just savor the passive-aggressive <em>fuck you/fuck you too</em> back-and-forth of Apple making available four useless sources to Mickle, and Mickle pointing out in the article just how useless the four sources Apple made available were.</p>

<p>But this one weird paragraph actually says a lot about the difference between Steve Jobs’s Apple and Cook’s. Jobs wouldn’t have participated in a profile like this, either, but I think Apple’s response would have been nothing more than the two-letter word “no”. With Cook, Apple still didn’t make him available, still didn’t make anyone who works at Apple available, and still didn’t make anyone who actually knows Cook available. But they offered Mickle and the Journal <em>something</em> rather than just telling him to go pound sand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though current and former employees say Mr. Cook has created a
more relaxed workplace than Mr. Jobs, he has been similarly
demanding and detail oriented. He once got irritated that the
company mistakenly shipped 25 computers to South Korea instead of
Japan, said a former colleague, adding that it seemed like a minor
misstep for a company shipping nearly 200 million iPhones
annually. “We’re losing our commitment to excellence,” Mr. Cook
said, this person recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>25 computers mistakenly shipped to Korea would not make my list of signs that Apple is losing its commitment to excellence, but this anecdote actually buoys me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, Mozilla’s contract with Google to include Google as
the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later
this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal
has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla’s
revenue, and without it experts see <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">a dim future for Mozilla past
2021</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s basically the whole story right there. Firefox was very popular, and Google paid Mozilla a small fortune to make Google search the default in Firefox because it was so popular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">But then came Chrome</a>. Why should Google fund Mozilla when Chrome is about 10 times more popular than Firefox, other than out of the goodness of their heart?</p>

<p>It is a very good thing for the world and the web that a truly independent browser exists from a privacy-minded company, but there’s not much of a business model for it unless it’s popular enough to get the dominant search engine to pay for placement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We must learn and expand different ways to support ourselves and
build a business that isn’t what we see today.”</p>

<p>This most likely includes a bigger focus <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-to-launch-vpn-product-in-the-next-few-weeks/">on Mozilla’s VPN
offering</a>, which Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/07/15/mozilla-puts-its-trusted-stamp-on-vpn/">formally launched last month</a>.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps are one of today’s biggest
money-makers in tech, and Mozilla, despite arriving late to the
party, is set to become one of the biggest players on the market,
primarily due to its reputation as a privacy-first organization
and civil and privacy rights advocate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea if a VPN offering can even come close to making up for the money Mozilla was earning from Google for default search placement, but it’s a great idea. If you’re going to use a VPN, you want to use one from a company you can trust, and Mozilla has a fortune of well-earned trust in the bank.</p>

She’s Maureen Dowd, and you’re not:</strong> New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd in an undated and uncredited AP photo<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-hack-how-a-maureen-756872" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> via the Hollywood Reporter.</a></span></h5>
<p>Apropos of nothing...Well, ok, of <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-maureen-dowd-hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-new-york-times-column-20200808-2iwbv35cbvcbfefshupfybuxs4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>something-</em></a>--here’s an anecdote from <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-world-as-it-is-ben-rhodes/1127923924?ean=9780525509370" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The World as It Is”</a>, Ben Rhodes’ memoir of his time as President Obama’s deputy national security advisor and chief speechwriter...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That night, Obama looked relieved to be over the hump of the speech as he joined the staff in a local restaurant for drinks with the traveling press. He ordered a martini and seemed at ease amid a cluster of people straining the hear the casual conversation he was making at one end of the table. I was seated next to Maureen Dowd, a columnist from the <em>New York Times</em> whom I’d read for years. I was excited and a little nervous. “Who are you?” she asked. “The speechwriter,” I said. He gave me a level stare and then complained that she wasn’t seated next to someone more important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhodes doesn’t pass off Dowd’s remark as a joke. He makes it plain it was a complaint, and issuing from Dowd’s sense of self-importance. The speech Rhodes had written was the one Obama delivered in the summer of 2008 to a crowd of 200,000 in Berlin. At the time it was still a good bet that Hillary Clinton would win the nomination. It was an audacious and hopeful decision (See what I did there?) to leave the campaign trail to grandstand on the foreign stage to show he was fit to be the leader of the Free World. It could have been a disaster. Instead, the speech was a tremendous success. The Germans loved it. So did most of the rest of the world. It can be argued that it helped him win the nomination and the Presidency. It was an important speech. Dowd can be excused for not realizing that night at the restaurant how important and for not intuiting how important Rhodes would grow to be in the Obama administration. But she had a chance to talk to the person who’d written the speech and ask him about the thinking that went into it and what it was meant to reveal about Obama’s foreign policy plans if he was elected and what that implied about the kind of president he’d be. Instead she was just miffed she couldn’t rub shoulders with the sort of political insiders she regarded as being on her level.</p>
<p>Dowd doesn’t have the cachet she had in July 2008. Among liberals on social media, she’s almost universally dismissed as a hack. But readers of the Times who have lives offline still read her with interest and approval. Pop Mannion read her assiduously right up until the end. And not just for political insight into the way the world works. He didn’t need her insight, particularly. He was fairly insightful himself, to put it mildly, and he read many sources for help in coming to his one conclusions. He read her or the pleasure he took in her writing about anything, and for writing lessons he could apply to writing his columns for the local newspapers. I’ve never been a fan. I used to read her as assiduously as Pop back when she was first coming into her own and her skills as a reporter still informed her political analyses, and not her high opinion of herself as reporter and analyst, back when she was more of a journalist and less of a purveyor of high-minded gossip. These days---not having a life off social media---I only read her when another one of her columns has blown up my twitter timeline, to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Dowd isn’t as lazy and facile as David Brooks. She isn’t shut up inside an intellectual fortress built of arrogance, entitlement, pomposity, and self-regard like Bret Stephens. But she can be as egregious in her way as both. Vanity and self-importance are the twined hallmarks of the writing styles of all three.</p>
<p>So I get a quick out of the sly way Rhodes offhandedly gets a bit of his own back there in the middle of the passage. There, where he identifies Dowd as “a columnist for the New York Times.” Not <em>the</em> columnist, one his readers are likely to recognize, without needing Rhodes to tell them who she is. And not <em>THE</em> columnist, the most famous and most-read New York Times columnist at the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>A</strong></em> columnist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p>In case you&#39;ve forgotten what all the fuss was about---there&#39;s been a lot more serious stuff to fuss about since---follow the llink to <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-maureen-dowd-hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-new-york-times-column-20200808-2iwbv35cbvcbfefshupfybuxs4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;Hillary Clinton mocks columnist Maureen Dowd for forgetting 2016 presidential ticket had a woman and man&quot;</a> by Dave Goldiner at the New York Daily News. It&#39;s fun to see Hillary get a little of her own back from Dowd who has been mean-girling her for going on twenty-five years.</p>
<p>And I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-world-as-it-is-ben-rhodes/1127923924?ean=9780525509370" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;The World as It Is&quot;</a>. It&#39;s one of the best political memoirs I&#39;ve read. Not only does it provide serious insight into the workings of the Obama administration---Rhodes is no mere purveyor of high-minded gossip---it&#39;s a good how-to manual for anyone who wants to go to work in politics and government. Not to mention, Rhodes can <em>write.</em></p>

    <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/11/setapp-subscription-service-now-include-ios-apps/">William Gallagher</a> (also: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/setapp-mac-app-subscription-service-expands-to-ios/">MacRumors</a>, <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/setapp-now-includes-ios-apps/">Mike Schmitz</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/11/setapp-subscription-service-now-include-ios-apps/"><p>Having launched back in 2017 with just 61 apps, Setapp is a continually growing subscription service which gives users access to paid-for apps for one monthly fee. Currently hosting around 190 Mac apps, the service has now added its first iOS ones.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>At launch, the major titles in the eight are the Ulysses writing app, and MindNode mind-mapping tool. It also includes Taskheat and 2Do task managers, the Paste clipboard manager, PDF Search, and SQLPro Studio.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Once you have an iOS device registered to your Setapp account, each eligible app&rsquo;s page on the Mac Setapp app contains a pair of QR codes. The first downloads the app from the App Store to your iOS device, then the second unlocks it.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1293248596830294022">Ryan Jones</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1293248596830294022">
<p>THIS BREAKS A GAZILLION RULES. We spend weeks making mental pretzels to understand the latest rule bullshit, and the something that breaks multiple explicit rules is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard about this a while ago and always assumed it <em>would</em> be allowed, because even though the guidelines forbid unlocking via means other than IAP, they specifically allow unlocking for multi-platform apps. This works for Microsoft and The Omni Group, and I don&rsquo;t see why Setapp unlocking the iOS versions of Mac apps would be any different.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"><p>3.1.1 In-App Purchase</p>
<p>If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services: Apps that operate across multiple platforms may allow users to access content, subscriptions, or features they have acquired in your app on other platforms or your web site, including consumable items in multiplatform games, provided those items are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Setapp/status/1293234916017213440">Setapp</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/Setapp/status/1293234916017213440">
<p>We would never put our vendors at risk. Therefore we&rsquo;ve received approval from Apple before going forward. It was confirmed that applications with integrated Setapp iOS framework fulfill the App Store Guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a lot of people shared Jones&rsquo; reaction, so I guess we&rsquo;ll see. The rules are anything but &ldquo;transparent and applied equally,&rdquo; as Tim Cook stated. <a href="https://afridigest.substack.com/p/why-super-apps-are-proliferating">WeChat</a> (via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23300199">Hacker News</a>) remains in the App Store despite offering a store within a store, and it&rsquo;s threatened more on iOS by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/kuo-wechat-ban-iphone-shipments/">U.S. government</a> than by App Store policy.</p>

<p>(My <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> app is <a href="https://c-command.com/store/setapp/toothfairy">available on Setapp</a> but is unaffected by this issue as it&rsquo;s Mac-only.)</p>

<blockquote cite="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/"><p>Mozilla  laid off about 70 employees today, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>In an internal memo, Mozilla chairwoman and interim CEO Mitchell Baker specifically mentions the slow rollout of the organization&rsquo;s new revenue-generating products as the reason for why it needed to take this action. The overall number may still be higher, though, as Mozilla is still looking into how this decision will affect workers in the U.K. and France. In 2018, Mozilla Corporation (as opposed to the much smaller Mozilla Foundation) said it had about 1,000 employees worldwide.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/"><p>Today we announced a significant restructuring of Mozilla Corporation. This will strengthen our ability to build and invest in products and services that will give people alternatives to conventional Big Tech. Sadly, the changes also include a significant reduction in our workforce by approximately 250 people.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To start, that means products that mitigate harms or address the kinds of the problems that people face today. Over the longer run, our goal is to build new experiences that people love and want, that have better values and better characteristics inside those products.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges. How can we lead towards business models that honor and protect people while creating opportunities for our business to thrive? How can we, or others who want a better internet, or those who feel like a different balance should exist between social and public benefit and private profit offer an alternative? We need to identify those people and join them. We must learn and expand different ways to support ourselves and build a business that isn&rsquo;t what we see today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is all rather vague, but it sounds like they want to diversify away from Firefox and have <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonSapin/status/1293231187167784960">laid off</a> most of the Servo team. What could be more important to the mission than maintaining an independent browser engine? On the other hand, Firefox is expensive to develop, and it&rsquo;s not clear how to replace the funding that had been provided by its primary competitor.</p>

    <p>My mother chose today&#8217;s photo. &#8220;Pick anything you want,&#8221; I said grandly. &#8220;Anything at all.&#8221; Naturally that meant she&#8217;d end up picking a picture much like yesterday&#8217;s. But I said anything, so what could I do?</p>
<p>Anyway, the two rightmost peaks (Modjeska and Santiago) form Saddleback, which is sort of a looming presence throughout Orange County. That is, it&#8217;s a looming presence <em>unless</em> you get up close and shoot it on an exceptionally clear day, as I did here. From this angle, in fact, you rightly wonder why anyone bothered to give it a name at all. Sometime in the future I&#8217;ll take a picture that shows Saddleback the way it&#8217;s more commonly seen, and its looming-ness will become a little more obvious.</p>

    <p>Is this true?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Millennials aren&#8217;t just the first generation set to do worse than our parents and our grandparents. If not for the (badly tattered) social safety net, we would be the most impoverished young adults since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) <a href="https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/1293201489125613568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></p>

<p>Pretty much, yes. <a href="https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Pathways_SOTU_2019_SafetyNet.pdf">This is for 30-year olds:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858308"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858308" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_poverty_generations.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="1194"></figure>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising. Many Millennials faced the full force of the Great Recession in their early 30s, and that had a big effect on their income. At the same time, the system worked the way it was intended: they also received more government assistance than other generations during this time. When you put this together, their poverty rate was about the same as Gen X and lower than either boomers or boomer parents at the same age:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858314"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858314" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_poverty_generations_2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="645"></figure>
<p>My only real objection to Filipovic&#8217;s tweet is her description of the social safety net as &#8220;badly tattered.&#8221; In fact, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/02/heres-why-bernie-sanders-doesnt-say-much-about-welfare-reform/">it&#8217;s grown steadily since the 60s</a> and is quite robust these days. Republicans seem to spend their entire careers fighting to tear it apart, but the truth is that they&#8217;ve only nibbled around the edges. We may still not be as generous to the poor as social democratic Europe—and our anti-poverty programs are egregiously splintered and inefficient—but spending is pretty high and it&#8217;s reponsible for keeping poverty at lower real levels than it was for older generations.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I think it&#8217;s important to keep two things in mind at the same time. It&#8217;s true that Millennials face unusual pressures: the Great Recession, student debt, and high housing costs foremost among them. At the same time, Millennial income at age 30 has recovered from the Great Recession and is now higher than it was for boomers and Xers.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858323"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1274px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858323" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_family_income_age_30-1.gif" alt="" width="1274" height="623"></figure>
<p>(This data precedes the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be years before we know how that affected different generations.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: Millennials, on net, are not as well off as previous generations: they have slightly higher incomes but noticeably higher expenses. At the same time, the difference with previous generations is smallish and they really aren&#8217;t massively impoverished. The real scandal here isn&#8217;t so much intergenerational as inter-class: Why is it that income has barely budged for <em>everyone</em> in the past three generations?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the rich have gotten nearly all the gains. That&#8217;s the common enemy, not the ordinary folks who are a decade older or younger than you.</p>

    <p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to crack down on loud, persistent house parties that are potential spreaders of COVID-19. How? By giving police who respond to complaints the authority to request that utilities at the property be cut off. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-10/police-union-party-house-garcetti-crackdown">The police union is having none of it:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mayor Garcetti wants to reimagine policing. He should send his civilian staff to turn off people’s electricity &amp; cut off their water,” the League said in a tweet over the weekend in response to the mayor’s plans. “Let officers deal with the rise in shootings and killings in L.A. We need a leader and not a political contortionist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a minor temper tantrum and I doubt anything will come of it. More generally, though, this kind of attitude has become so widespread in the wake of attempts to reform policing that I wonder if police forces risk losing the support of people who would normally be on their side? How long will taxpayers put up with threats to stop doing their job every time police forces are asked to make even the smallest change or sacrifice? It&#8217;s childish stuff and before long it&#8217;s likely to create a backlash that does the police no good.</p>

<p class="">For the last few months, I have been playing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/" target="_blank"><span>with an Oculus Quest</span></a>. I never really had any experience with virtual reality (VR) before, and I decided that there was no better time to look for a little escape than amid the pandemic.</p><p class="">The technology is impressive, yet I don’t find myself spending more than a few hours a week in virtual space. Of course, there is a <em>Star Wars</em> game and, of course, that is where I spend the most time.</p><p class="">However, I recently tried out a new Oculus app that is intriguing.&nbsp;<a href="https://immersedvr.com/" target="_blank"><span>The app is called <em>Immersed</em></span></a>, and it is quite a trip. With the app on your Oculus Quest and the host software loaded on your Mac, you can have your Mac’s monitor appear in virtual space. They have a lot of options ranging from an alpine cabin, to a “productivity cave”, to a starship. I am currently orbiting the planet Earth on a starship while I compose this blog post. We just flew over Mexico.</p><p class="">If you have never played with a VR device before, they are something else. The resolution is not as high as a retina screen, but the overall impression is that you are someplace else. It is easy to lose track of your actual surroundings while in VR. The above screenshot does not do it justice. It is entirely readable. The surprising thing about <em>Immersed</em> is that it works. I am able to write this post (and several others) with no noticeable lag in typing, and part of me actually thinks I am on a starship. There are, of course, a few downsides:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The screen resolution isn’t nearly as good as my standard monitor. Also, I had to set my monitor display to its largest size to really make this work. That said, I can read and interact with the entire screen with little or no eye strain.</p></li><li><p class="">Unlike the keyboard, my wireless mouse can get laggy. Not always, but sometimes. It’s fine for text editing, but lousy for gaming.</p></li><li><p class="">You really need to be a touch typist to make this work. You can’t see your keyboard or mouse at all because you are in space, or a cabin, or on top of a mountain, or a creepy cave that is supposed to make you productive.</p></li><li><p class="">Facebook! That company that I don’t like makes this thing I have strapped on my head. You can have an account without signing into Facebook, but in order to get this screenshot exported, I had to log in to Facebook for the first time in years. I can only guess what it is going to take for me to unring that bell. Talk about taking one for the team.</p></li><li><p class="">Weight and battery life. This app and the connection seems to be burning up my Oculus battery at a rate of 30% per hour. Also, the Oculus itself gets heavy on your head after a while.</p></li><li><p class="">After spending a few hours in virtual space, I felt a bit fatigued. I don’t know if it was the screen resolution, the motion of my starship, or the weight of the device on my head, but I was ready to return to Earth. I don’t think I could do this for more than a few hours at a time.</p></li></ul><p class="">This is really just a first step. I could see myself working in a virtual zen garden or on the planet Endor for extended periods of time once these VR devices get lighter and better. I’m having a great time writing several posts for this week in a spaceship. I may go down to my alpine cabin next for an OmniFocus review session. Seriously, this is fun for a productivity nerd like me. I will report back in a month to tell you if I am still using it or if the shininess wore off. In the meantime, I just passed over Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <p>As a person of routine, part of my morning regimen for the last several decades is settling down with my morning cup of tea and reading some comic strips. As a kid, I’d dig through the newspaper to find the funny pages, and the full-color Sunday section was the highlight of the week.</p>
<p>But for the past twenty years or so, my comic strip reading has been all digital; I’ve even added a few webcomics into the mix over time.<sup id="fnref-12693-abandoned"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-abandoned" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> At some point in the dim and misty past, I put all of my comics into a folder in my browser’s bookmark bar; every morning, I would click (or later tap) that folder and all my comics would open in tabs.</p>
<p>As systems go, it’s fine. But it presents two challenges: first, not every comic I read updates on the same schedule. Some are seven-day affairs, like reruns of “Calvin &amp; Hobbes” and “Doonesbury.” Others update only on weekdays. Some are just on Sundays. Others solely on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Which meant that most days I knew I would just be automatically closing some of those tabs.</p>
<p>In and of itself, I could handle the sheer <em>onerous</em> nature of having to close some tabs—the horror!—but there was another more bothersome annoyance. Many of the comics I read are served up through one of the major comics syndicate websites, GoComics. Several years ago, the site changed its interface so that when you go to the main landing page for a comic—say, again, <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/">Calvin &amp; Hobbes</a>—all you would see is a crop of the day’s comic, which you would then have to click to get to the full comic. That meant every comic I read on that site now required an extra, obnoxious step.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gocomics-calvinandhobbes.png?resize=1360%2C855&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This page basically seems to designed to force you to look at a bunch of ads before getting to the content you want (and it runs half the content in the bargain!)</figcaption></figure><p>Boy, this sounds like a job for automation, if there ever was one.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I finally had the impetus to create a shortcut to streamline this process. After mucking with it on and off during various beta updates, I finally ended up with a version that works pretty well <em>and</em> is easily customizable, meaning I can share it with people.</p>
<p>The whole process ended up being more complicated than I initially thought, for a few reasons. First, though I’ve spent more time in Shortcuts recently, I’m still in a scenario of having to fit my programming knowledge (derived mainly from my time as a PHP developer) into the available receptacle (creating Shortcuts), which is, at times, very much a round-peg, square-hole situation.<sup id="fnref-12693-loops"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-loops" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> Second, some of the iOS 14 beta releases had glitches that interfered with Shortcuts, meaning I had to set the shortcut aside until the next release came along.</p>
<p>But what I ultiamtely ended up with is <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/317da8bd3dc54dfc8d9ab324237e08b1">this shortcut</a>: It takes a list of comics, each of which has an associated schedule and a URL. When it’s launched, it checks to see which of the comics have the current day in their regular schedule, then compiles a list which it opens in tabs in Safari. And, as a bonus, if the comic in question is hosted on GoComics, it automatically edits the URL so that you’re taken <em>directly</em> to the full comic, rather than making you click through.<sup id="fnref-12693-image"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-image" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps nobody else in the world has this particular habit. Who knows? But maybe someone out there will get something out of this shortcut. If so, you can download it at the link above and may it increase your comic reading habits a thousandfold.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr><ol><li id="fn-12693-abandoned">
The highlight of that period was probably about 20 years ago, and I’ve given up on all but a few. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-abandoned"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>
</li>
<li id="fn-12693-loops">
Figuring out how to loop through a multi-dimensional dictionary in Shortcuts almost broke my brain, especially as this is something I know how to do in PHP and could implement almost without thinking about it. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-loops"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>
</li>
<li id="fn-12693-image">
If I were being perhaps a little more…subversive, I would be scraping for just the comic images on the page. But that seems to take this to a different level. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-image"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>

<p>I noticed yesterday that the population in a zip code near me is roughly equal to the zip code itself. So I wondered:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Does any zip code equal its population?</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a silly question. A zip code isn&#8217;t a quantity. Populations are always changing. Zip code boundaries are always changing. Etc.</p>
<p>The answer, according to the data I had on hand, is almost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Smallest absolute error: Zip code 00674 has population 672.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Smallest relative error: Zip code 42301 has population 42319.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had to learn some of the intricacies of zip codes in the course of my work on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>. I found out that zip codes are more complicated than I ever would have thought.</p>
<p>For one thing, the US Census doesn&#8217;t exactly report data by zip code but by zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) for reasons that make sense but are too complicated to get into here. This is another reason why the question posed here is fuzzy; we don&#8217;t know the populations of zip codes unless they coincide with ZCTAs.</p>

    <p>Most project management software (a) takes a lot of time to configure, (b) is not built for cross-functional teams, and (c) takes focus away from releases. The status quo is that engineers spend precious time wading through tickets.</p>

<p>We’ve been dedicated to designing a modern and simple interface that just works for teams building rapidly. Tara AI helps engineers and teams deliver on planned releases with simple sprint planning, a unified view of tasks and a clear overview of daily priorities synced to Github.</p>

<p>We’re excited to be launching v1.0 to the DF community, <a href="https://tara.ai/?ref=daringfireball"><em>with no user or task limits, free of charge</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Antony Johnston — best known as the creator of the excellent and right-up-my-alley <em><a href="https://antonyjohnston.com/work/atomicblonde/">Atomic Blonde</a></em> — hosts a podcast devoted to writing, and he was kind enough to invite me on. I could talk about writing — what I do, how I do it — forever, even though, as I hope I made clear to Johnston, I don’t really fully understand how exactly I do what I do. The only thing I <em>really</em> understand about writing is that I need to do it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed having the opportunity to talk about this. If that sounds interesting to you, I bet you’ll dig listening.</p>

    <p>Speaking of podcasts, another month, another new album cover for <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>, the new thrice-weekly podcast with me and <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://dithering.fm/" class="noborder">
<img
    src = "/misc/2020/08/dithering-aug-2020.png"
    alt = "August 2020 cover art for Dithering, depicting a bunch of kids, in two groups, battling each other in a water balloon game of some sort."
    width = "500"
/></a></p>

<p>One reason Ben and I make for a good team, I think, is that even when we agree on something, we often see the issue from very different perspectives. But we don’t always agree, and to date, never less so than regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">this controversy</a> over Apple’s ban on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass streaming service from the App Store. We’ve had some crackerjack episodes these last few days — but our arguments are constructive, not destructive. What makes for an invigorating disagreement is the shared belief that you can only have confidence that your opinion is correct if you’re willing to honestly contemplate that you might be wrong. We’ve got that.</p>

<p>More good news, too, for the Dithering curious. The obvious downside to a paid subscription podcast ($5/month — cheap!) is that some prospective listeners naturally want to know what the show is like before paying. We’ve been thinking about this since we initially conceived of the show, and last week launched our solution: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/itunes/id1525886040">Dithering Preview</a>, a free podcast with the best clips from each month’s episodes.</p>

<p>You should be able to find it just by searching for “Dithering Preview” in your favorite podcast player, or use one of the handy shortcuts below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/itunes/id1525886040">Apple Podcasts</a></li>

<li><a href="https://dithering.fm/preview/feed">RSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence, give an episode or two of Dithering Preview a listen, and you’ll get an honest taste of what the show is like. For those of you who’ve already subscribed, I thank you kindly for listening, and for helping to spread the word about the show.</p>

<p>Apple looks to be giving its own ad network a leg up on competitors with customer data that other ad networks can&rsquo;t access. In iOS 14, Apple Advertising appears to have a separate settings panel with a default-on setting. Other advertisers and ad networks on iOS, however, need to ask permission every single time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Except that if you view an article that <em>is</em> available in Apple News, that information is then sent to Apple. (Of course, by default, every Web page you view in Safari is sent to your iCloud account, anyway.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see Apple News+ make it much easier to recover the original link to an article. I can get there by digging through the share panel, but it is certainly not obvious. And Google makes this just as difficult, often offering up a link to a link that takes you to Google&rsquo;s servers.</p>
<p>This gatekeeping behavior is not helping solve the &ldquo;news decline&rdquo; problem. It&rsquo;s not helping get publishers paid, and that&rsquo;s not good for reporters/writers.</p>

<p>Apfelkind (Apple Child) is a cafe in Bonn where parents can sip lattes while children play with toys or listen to storytellers. Its logo shows the outline of a child&rsquo;s face within a red apple &#x2013; with none of the characteristic bite marks of the electronics manufacturer&rsquo;s logo.</p>
<p>Yet when Apfelkind&rsquo;s owner, Christin R&ouml;mer, filed a trademark application for her company in 2011, Apple got in touch asking her to withdraw the request since customers could potentially confuse the two logos.</p>
<p>R&ouml;mer stood firm and a two-year legal correspondence ensued. Last week Apple withdrew its objection.</p>

    <p>I have been an Apple user for 35 years. Do you have one minute for a little story? Thanks.</p>
<p>I have been trying to install your fucking OS update on my fucking watch for three fucking days now. First, I had to unpair and re-pair it because there wasn’t enough room for the update (even though I have very few apps on my watch). That was the only way to free up space because your storage management is for shit. Then it refused to update overnight despite telling me it was going to (in fairness, this wasn’t surprising—the iPad has been lying about updating itself overnight for ages). Now I’m trying to do the update manually, and I keep getting this fucking message:</p>
<p><img alt="Watch update error message" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200810-Watch%20update%20error%20message.png" title="Watch update error message" width="50%"/></p>
<p>So I deleted the downloaded Software Update so I can try again. Why should this work? I have no idea; it’s like restarting a Windows machine. While I was deleting, I noticed that Music was taking up a lot of space because the fucking Heavy Rotation playlist was turned on again, despite my having turned it off.</p>
<p>You should all be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8">Ben Gilbert, reporting yesterday for Business Insider</a> (italic emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This September, Microsoft plans to launch a major coup in the
video game business: The world’s first game streaming service with
a built-in library, Netflix-style. For $15 a month, you’ll be able
to stream over 100 games to smartphones and tablets — but it
won’t be available on Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><em>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because
Apple isn’t able to review each game that’s available through
Game Pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness">controversy over Basecamp’s Hey app</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Tim Cook being called to testify at an antitrust Congressional hearing</a> regarding App Store policies, and given the high profile of Xbox Game Pass, it’s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200806/p45#a200806p45">has gotten a lot of attention</a>, almost all of it focused on taking the italicized paragraph from Business Insider at its word. But that’s Ben Gilbert’s interpretation, not a quote from Apple. Gilbert’s interpretation is not an unfair or sensationalized take on Apple’s statement, but it’s adding a “because” that Apple did not state. That entire sentence is <em>not</em> a paraphrase of something Apple said.</p>

<p>Here is Apple’s statement to Business Insider, apparently in its entirety. Apple seemingly sent this statement <em>only</em> to Business Insider, which itself is a bit unusual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for
customers to discover and download apps, and a great business
opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all
apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are
intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing
field to developers.</p>

<p>Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of
developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App
Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users
over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running this statement through my Applespeak-to-English decoder ring, what I hear is not that they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game separately. What I hear is that game streaming services are not allowed in the iOS App Store. Period, full stop. I don’t even think this has anything to do with whether Microsoft offers in-app subscriptions, or whether those subscriptions get a discount from the standard 70/30 split for the first year. I think Apple’s stance is that game streaming services like Microsoft’s xCloud project are simply verboten.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-07">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2.7">App Store guideline 4.2.7</a>, “Remote Desktop Clients”, seemingly makes this clear, too — it’s a written rule, not an unwritten one. This rule is why <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about">Steam Link</a> is in the App Store and Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia are not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is
    a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the
    user, and both the host device and client must be connected on
    a local and LAN-based network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like this: Business Insider asked Apple why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass. Apple didn’t say why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass, and instead gave a non-answer answer by describing what they do allow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submitting games individually and appearing in charts and search — presumably App Store charts and search — is just an obfuscated way of saying that native iOS game apps are allowed in the iOS App Store. Well, duh. Everyone is distracted by the interpretation that Apple won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game. It is a nonsensical justification, no doubt about that. But the comparison to Netflix or Spotify is beside the point. Of course Apple doesn’t and can’t review every movie on Netflix or every song on Spotify. But if you think about it, they <em>could</em> review every game on Xbox Game Pass. Even if it’s 100 games, they could look at them all. I’m sure they could find quite a few volunteers among the App Store reviewer corps to spend the time to play these games thoroughly.</p>

<p>The point is that streaming video and music services are allowed in the App Store; streaming software (games or otherwise) is not, unless it works over the web. <em>Apple just doesn’t want to say that.</em> Here, in my opinion, is how this conversation is best decoded:</p>

<p><strong>Business Insider</strong>: <em>Why are game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass not allowed in the App Store?</em></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong>: <em>Native iPhone games are allowed in the App Store. Native iPhone games are good because we review them individually, and they appear in App Store charts and search results.</em></p>

<p>It’s a perfect example of the difference between bullshit and a lie. Every word in Apple’s statement is true, but not a word of it answers why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass or any other cloud game streaming service.</p>

<p>Apple would have been much better off saying nothing at all than offering this bullshit non-answer answer, that in fact was so easily and reasonably misconstrued. And, purely as a guess on my part, I think Apple realized this, which is why they didn’t send this statement to any other outlet and haven’t added a word of clarification since.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just about the money, or even partially about the money<sup id="fnr2-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn2-2020-08-07">2</a></sup> — which certainly wouldn’t be shocking — but we don’t know, because Apple didn’t say, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/">neither did Microsoft in its own testily worded statement</a>, which, unlike Apple’s statement, was distributed to numerous news outlets.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2020-08-07">
<p>I really hope it’s <em>not</em> about the money. I mean let’s face it, no matter what the story is here, it’s sad in some way. Microsoft has made something technically impressive and cool and fun, and millions of Xbox-playing iOS users would love to play these games on their iPhones and iPads and but they can’t because of some sort of business or strategic shit that’s between Apple and Microsoft. But if it’s really just a dispute about goddamn money — between, of all companies, two of the richest in the history of the world — man, that’s just tawdry. It’s just two <em>corporations</em> fighting over one more stream of money neither even knows what to do with atop the Scrooge McDuckian mountains of cash they each already have flooding into their coffers each day. That’s business, but that’s a stale saltine of a story.</p>

<p>But what if it’s <em>not</em> Apple being a dick about money? What if it’s Apple being a dick about control?</p>

<p>That’s not cold and dry — that’s a goddamn sizzling hot juicy steak of a story. That’s <em>personal</em>. For one thing it would explain the pissy, petulant tone of Microsoft’s statement. Maybe Microsoft went into this whole endeavor gearing up for a knockdown drag-out knife-fight negotiation about how exactly to split the money, and Apple just went stone cold <a href="https://youtu.be/wPmTp9up26w?t=87">Michael Corleone on them</a>: “<em>You can have our answer now, if you like. Our offer is this: nothing. Not even the 30 percent fee for the gaming subscription, which we would appreciate if you put up your ass.</em>” The idea being, in this scenario, that Apple has something Microsoft needs, Microsoft has nothing to offer in return that Apple wants, and so Microsoft just has to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZhj7rPPzxg">sit there grooving on it</a>, stuck with a premium paid subscription service that’s only available on the low-rent mobile platform <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">where people don’t pay for things</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is clearly being a dick to Microsoft about <em>something</em> here, and if it’s platform control not money, well by god at least there’s some delicious poetic justice at play. That’d be a veritable vintage bottle of wine being uncorked. Not having any control over the world’s most lucrative computing platform and wanting something from the company that does — and which has a real taste for exerting its dictatorial control over said platform in mercurial fashion — would fucking suck, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the first days after she was elected governor of South Dakota in 2018, Kristi Noem had been working to ensure that President Trump would come to Mount Rushmore for a fireworks-filled July 4 extravaganza.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2018/04/24/president-donald-trump-mount-rushmore-trumpmore/544597002/">the president had told her</a> in the Oval Office that he aspired to have his image etched on the monument. And last year, a White House aide reached out to the governor’s office with a question, according to a Republican official familiar with the conversation: What’s the process to add additional presidents to Mount Rushmore? […]</p>

<p>In private, the efforts to charm Mr. Trump were more pointed, according to a person familiar with the episode: Ms. Noem greeted him with a four-foot replica of Mount Rushmore that included a fifth presidential likeness: his.</p>

    <p>A major college conference has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/08/mac-fall-football-postponed/">canceled its fall sports:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Mid-American Conference postponed its football season,</strong> the conference announced Saturday, becoming the first Football Bowl Subdivision league to decide not to hold games this fall because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8230;.“<strong>The decision is grounded in the core values of the Conference that prioritize student-athlete well-being,</strong> an area the MAC has traditionally taken a leadership role,” Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s good to see a college sports conference putting its athletes first even if it means losing—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many MAC schools rely on the revenue generated through guarantee games — when a Power Five school pays another program to play it during the nonconference schedule. <strong>Most of these games have been canceled</strong> because all of the Power Five leagues have chosen to play one or zero nonconference games this season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, I see. Without any of these guarantee games, football suddenly becomes a money loser for MAC schools. And just as suddenly, the well-being of the players becomes paramount and the season is canceled. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Big Ten has canceled its football season too. I&#8217;m sure all the other dominoes will now fall as well.</p>
<p>With no fans in the stands, I imagine that football is a money loser even for Power Five schools. That probably made it a lot easier to do the right thing.</p>

    <p>Most of Apple’s early laptops were, like today’s MacBooks, <em>complete</em> Macs. The premise was: “Let’s engineer a Mac that’s like the one on your desk, but put it in a single package with screen, keyboard, pointing device, and battery.” My first laptop was a PowerBook 160 and it did everything my old Mac SE did (and much, much more).</p>
<p>The PowerBook Duo was different. It wasn’t trying to be the Mac on your desk. <span id="more-12646"></span> Introduced in 1992,<sup id="fnref-12646-160"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-160" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> it was the MacBook Air or one-port MacBook of its time—all compromise in a quest to be as thin and light as possible. If you wanted the absolutely smallest, lightest Mac laptop you could find, you got a PowerBook Duo and dealt with the weirdness.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duo-air-buddies.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Separated at birth? The PowerBook Duo was the MacBook Air of its day, prioritizing thinness and lightness over “required” features.</figcaption></figure><p>How small and how light? By today’s standards <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2897715/the-new-macbook-is-cool-but-the-powerbook-duo-was-cooler.html">the PowerBook Duo was laughably large</a>, but 1992 was a different time. My first PowerBook weighed seven pounds; the first PowerBook Duo weighed four. It  was also 1.4 inches thick—more than an inch thinner than my PowerBook.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a complete Mac. It had a shrunken-down keyboard and trackball, and only a single standard port. (Sound familiar, MacBook fans?) There was no support for floppy drives, external hard drives or monitors. For all of that stuff, you needed to connect it to a docking station.</p>
<p>Today we don’t flinch at the idea of a computer without a built-in floppy drive, but back in the mid-90s, floppies were the currency of the realm. <em>Even six years later,</em> people screamed bloody murder when the original iMac was released lacking a floppy drive. The Duo? Nope. (If you needed access to floppies, you’d need to buy an external disk drive.)</p>
<p>It also didn’t have a headphone jack! This one seems completely bananas now—I can’t imagine working on a laptop out in public without plugging in headphones. But back then, we didn’t really play music on our computers—this was the Walkman era—so Apple got away with shaving that port off.</p>
<p>The only standard port on the Duo, hiding behind a little door that you could rotate and turn into a foot to help angle the keyboard perfectly for carpal tunnel syndrome<sup id="fnref-12646-rsi"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-rsi" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>, was a single Mac serial port. That wasn’t nothing, because you could use it to connect to a modem (if you didn’t pay for the optional internal modem) or a printer or even a very slow local-area network via LocalTalk. But, that was it.</p>
<p>And this is where the PowerBook Duo got…interesting. It remains the only Mac to be built with an Apple docking station in mind. Apple sold two of them, and third-party vendors filled in the gaps with all sorts of other contraptions, all connected via the Duo’s most important (and most nonstandard) port, the 156-pin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot">Processor Direct Slot</a>.</p>
<p>When I say “Mac docking station,” you probably can imagine what I’m talking about. When I was a full-time PowerBook and MacBook user, I used a bunch of third-party ones—you’d connect your monitor, speakers, hard drive, and other stuff to a plastic frame and then slide your laptop into it to make the connections and hopefully not ruin the ports on the back or sides.</p>
<p>And yes, the Duo had those kinds of docks. It was the original Dongletown. Apple’s <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duo_minidock.html">Duo MiniDock</a> clipped on the back and added a modem jack, audio-in and audio-out plugs, a SCSI port, two serial ports, video out, ADB for keyboards and mice, a floppy-disk port, and an AC adapter. (If that seemed like too much, there was also a Duo Floppy Adapter, that added a floppy-disk port <em>and</em> an ADB port.)</p>
<p>But docking stations like that are kind of boring. What you wanted to do, if you were John Sculley-era Apple, was to create a big, bold docking station that could transform that tiny PowerBook Duo into a full-fledged desktop Mac. You wanted to create the <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duodock.html">Duo Dock</a>, the accessory that makes the PowerBook Duo more significant than it would be if it were just Apple’s first attempt to make a tiny laptop.</p>

The two-tone color scheme matched PowerBook and monitor alike.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what MacUser’s Russell Ito wrote in his launch story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let’s get one thing clear: This thing looks weird. We’re not talking technology or functionality, mind you, just aesthetics. From its two-tone finish (platinum on top, granite on the bottom—according to Apple, the top will match your monitor, and the bottom, your PowerBook), to its partially melted-looking lid, to its strange cylindrical feet sticking out the sides, this is easily the most visually “unusual” computer Apple has produced since the Lisa.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I prefer to think of the Duo Dock as a front-loading VCR that takes laptops instead of videocassettes<sup id="fnref-12646-vcr"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-vcr" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>. Because that’s how it worked. You closed your Duo and inserted it into the tray of the Duo Dock, which would eventually click into place and pull itself snugly closed. In a decade when Apple never skimped on custom intercapped names for their products, the system that locked the Duo in place in the Duo Dock was called PowerLatch.</p>
<p>The Duo Dock packed in all the parts of a desktop Mac that weren’t present on the Duo. There was a floppy drive (not just a connector, like on the MiniDock), a hard-drive bay for a single 3.5-inch half-height drive, two NuBus slots—that’s right, you could install add-on cards that the computer could use when it was docked—space for additional video RAM (to drive larger monitors), and even a slot for a floating-point unit (FPU) chip. This was a dock that could actually expand your computer’s central processor and make it faster.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerlatch-duo.gif?ssl=1" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Patented PowerLatch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology.</figcaption></figure><p>That level of integration came at a cost: You basically needed to shut down your laptop to eject it from the Dock. If you pressed the eject button on the Dock—yes, there was an eject button—it would tell the Duo to shut down, and you’d be prompted to save your files. Once the laptop was off, the ejection process would start. (When you inserted a Duo in the Dock, it would automatically reconnect you to your file servers, which was nice.)</p>
<p>Still, the idea of the Duo Dock was kind of brilliant. I frequently hear the hosts of <a href="http://atp.fm/">one of my favorite podcasts</a> debate the merits of going full-time with a laptop versus having a separate laptop and desktop. The Duo tried to provide the best of both worlds, with a light laptop that could inherit the traits of a desktop Mac when it was sucked into its little plastic house.</p>
<p>The lifespan of the entire PowerBook Duo product line from introduction to discontinuation was less than five years. But it lives on in reruns of NewsRadio, Seinfeld, and quintessential mid-90s films like “The Net” (which was shot at Macworld Expo San Francisco) and “Hackers.”</p>
<p>This time period coincides with my first few years working at MacUser magazine. I had never seen a Duo in the wild before I started to work at MacUser, and even there, they were rare. In an era that stands among the worst in Apple’s history, the full-featured PowerBook was a hit, but not the Duo. It lived off in its own parallel universe, a niche within a niche.</p>
<p>The Duo line was discontinued in early 1997, before Steve Jobs got the chance to kill it himself. Though <a href="https://512pixels.net/2011/09/modern-docking-station/">you could make the argument</a> that Apple’s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162442/2011/09/apples_thunderbolt_display_a_compelling_device_for_2011_macbook_air.html?lsrc=top_1">Thunderbolt Display</a> was a MacBook docking station disguised as a display, we never really saw the Duo Dock’s like again.</p>

    <p>Donald Trump has issued some executive orders related to coronavirus aid, and I suppose we&#8217;re all supposed to take them seriously. But why? To paraphrase an old saying, the stuff that&#8217;s legal is unimportant and the stuff that&#8217;s important is illegal. It&#8217;s just more Trump blather designed to keep the spotlight on him.</p>
<p>But I suppose you want a little more than that. Fine. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first EO provides a $400 unemployment bonus. This is important, but almost certainly not legal. The money is supposed to be transferred from unspent FEMA accounts, which is a transfer that Trump probably can&#8217;t make. What&#8217;s more, Trump wants states to pick up 25 percent of the cost, and he definitely can&#8217;t do that. The Supreme Court made that clear when it struck down Obamacare&#8217;s Medicaid mandate. What&#8217;s even yet more, even if all this were legal, the money would only last five weeks.</li>
<li>The second EO defers payroll taxes from September through December. This is probably legal, but deeply trivial. The amount of money involved is small. It helps only people who are already employed. And the deferred taxes have to be paid back in a lump sum in January. It&#8217;s pointless.</li>
<li>A third EO asks federal agencies to &#8220;consider&#8221; whether evictions should be temporarily halted. This is obviously legal, but has no impact at all.</li>
<li>Finally, the fourth EO defers student loan payments through the end of the year. This is legal, and maybe even modestly important. However, like the payroll tax deferral, it will primarily help out people who are the most likely to still have jobs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am deeply tired of these idiotic Republican games. Because that&#8217;s all they seem to be to them: games. There are millions of Americans in deep, deep trouble because of the coronavirus, and they&#8217;re in even deeper trouble than they should be thanks to Trump&#8217;s gross mismanagement of the crisis. But none of that seems to matter to any of them. Human suffering is just another political lever to be used in service of God only knows what political aim they have at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all so appalling and loathsome. I can barely stand reading about it any longer, let alone writing about it.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 9. You may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post new numbers on Sunday. I normally do them the night before, but on Saturday night I was tired and it just didn&#8217;t happen. Then Sunday was crash day and I didn&#8217;t fully wake up until about 2 pm. By then it seemed kind of pointless, so I just skipped it. Today, however, we have nice, fresh numbers and Argentina is starting to look really, really bad.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>After posting my <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/08/development-shortcuts-and-warhol/">Warhol shortcut</a>, I got a couple of good suggestions for improvements. They overlapped to some extent, so I put them together into <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/74ccef08af784e78abfe8a4448f8ae9b">a new Warhol</a>.</p>
<p>First, David Sparks pointed out that it would be helpful to end the shortcut by opening Photos so you can both see the new image and do something with it. And Leddy, <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/dr-drang-s-warhol-shortcut/7901">in the Automators discussion forum</a>, had a suggestion for running it both the Share Sheet and directly from Shortcuts without running into memory constraints. As I was trying out Leddy’s suggestion, I learned that Warhol <em>wasn’t</em> constrained by memory when run from the Share Sheet. (Apparently I’d run into that problem during one of the the early iterations of Warhol and never went back to check if the later improvements made it efficient enough to avoid the memory constraint.)</p>
<p>So now Warhol can be run from both Shortcuts and the Share Sheet in Photos. If it’s run from Shortcuts, it finishes by opening Photos. If it’s run from the Share Sheet, Photos is already open.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in the improved Warhol:</p>

    <p>SheetPlanner helps you organize information, manage your projects, and schedule your tasks and activities with unparalleled power and flexibility.</p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SheetPlanner-1-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Get organized…</strong><br />
Organize information using the Outliner to provide structure. Populate the start, finish and progress columns to create a schedule and track progress. Add custom, text, number, date, symbol, list and picture columns to track additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Make a plan…</strong><br />
Visualize tasks with start and finish dates on the Timeline. Change the Timeline scope to get a high level view of  your project over multiple years or zoom in to weeks or even days for more precision. See the progress of each task in the Timeline. Customize the color of Timeline bars. Preview and print the Timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Get things done…</strong><br />
Use filters to focus on what&#8217;s important, due today, due tomorrow, or whatever criteria you determine. View filtered tasks in the timeline, month and yearly calendar. Check items off as they are completed in the outline, timeline, month or year views. Hide completed items to stay focused.</p>
<p>You can download SheetPlanner <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sheetplanner/id1438761088?mt=12">from the Mac App Store, where a 21-day trial is available.</a></p>

    <p class="">Samual Axon at Arts Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/" target="_blank">published an interview</a> with Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) chief John Giannandrea concerning the state of AI at Apple.</p><p class="">If you go back enough years, you can see plenty of articles and hear podcasts where I bemoaned Apple’s ability to compete with AI given the fact that they were not willing, for instance, to throw all of our pictures together so they would have one massive server database for the AI gods. Instead, Apple always said they were going to protect user privacy, and while I agreed with the sentiment, I worried about its long term effects.</p><p class="">However, Apple has been turning my opinion around on this <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/6/privacy-and-big-data" target="_blank">over the past several years</a>. This latest article settles my mind entirely on the question. The point that comes through several times is that Apple believes doing AI analysis on a device actually gives the best user experience because the computing is getting done closer to the user. </p>

<figure class="block-animation-none">
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"
  >
    <span>&#147;</span>Yes, I understand this perception of bigger models in data centers somehow are more accurate, but it’s actually wrong. It’s actually technically wrong. It’s better to run the model close to the data, rather than moving the data around. And whether that’s location data—like what are you doing— [or] exercise data—what’s the accelerometer doing in your phone—it’s just better to be close to the source of the data, and so it’s also privacy preserving.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; John Giannandrea</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="">This is the first time I’ve heard someone from Apple explain how their AI model is better because it is faster, and the privacy benefits are icing on the cake. Privacy has always been at the front of that argument. It’s never been the “also”, until now.</p><p class="">I think the reason Apple is starting to talk more about this is the significant lead they have with Apple silicon.  I’m just not convinced any other company can pull off AI on the device the way Apple is right now. If anyone at Apple were to ask me, I would say push down the gas pedal with on-device AI as hard as you possibly can. </p>

    <p>August tends to be right in the middle of the summer doldrums, the time when everybody goes on vacation and thus news—including tech announcements—are few and far between. Then again, 2020 isn’t your average year, so perhaps it’s not a shock that this week saw a departure from the norm with Apple announcing a surprisingly substantial <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3199629/imacs-release-features-specs-pricing-faq.html">update to the iMac</a>.</p>
<p>My colleague Jason Snell has <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html">already expounded upon what the revamp to Apple’s popular desktop means for the future of that product</a>, but I think it’s worth it to take a moment and see what we can extrapolate from this update and learn about the future of Apple’s <em>other</em> devices. Apple is no stranger to introducing updates in one device that eventually migrate to the rest of its lineup, even from the Mac to the iPhone and iPad and vice versa, and this iMac update is certainly no exception.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3570430/what-the-imac-refresh-can-tell-us-about-apples-future-products.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/08/images-of-concentric-circles/">previous post</a> looked at the images of concentric circles under functions defined by power series. The terms of these series have the form</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>z</em><sup>θ(<em>n</em>)</sup> / θ(<em>n</em>)</p>
<p>where θ(<em>n</em>) is a rapidly increasing function of <em>n</em>. These series are thin (technically, lacunary) because all the terms between values of θ(<em>n</em>) are missing.</p>
<p>The previous post used factorials and powers of 2 as the thinning function. This post uses Fibonacci numbers. It differs from the previous post by using more circles and by making all the circles the same color rather than using matplotlib&#8217;s default colors.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s the plot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_fibonacci2.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>It looks sorta like a tree with ingrown bark.</p>
<p>The code to produce the plot was the same as the code in the previous post with the following changes.</p>
<pre>
    def fib(n):
        phi = (1 + 5**0.5)/2
        return int(phi**n/5**0.5 + 0.5)

    for r in linspace(0, 1, 60):
        z = f(fib, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag, 'b', alpha=0.6)
</pre>
<p>The function <code>fib</code> above uses Binet&#8217;s formula to compute Fibonacci numbers.</p>

    <p>So let’s just get this out of the way: Rogue Amoeba was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">last week’s sponsor</a> here at DF but the sponsorship was for Loopback, for which I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/09/loopback">just posted</a> my end-of-the-week thank-you. But this week they <em>also</em> released a major update to another of their excellent Mac audio utilities, SoundSource, and it’s well worth your attention.</p>

<p>SoundSource is on my short list of Mac utilities that I don’t know what I’d do without. It’s the system-wide audio menu item that ought to be built into MacOS. It gives you instant volume control to every output and input device connected to your Mac, and per-application controls for controlling audio input and output. When I wrote about SoundSource 4 last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/soundsource-4">I noted the interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SoundSource is also a great example of a distinctive, branded UI
that still looks and feels in every way like a standard Mac app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SoundSource 5 is a solid upgrade on functional grounds alone — just the audio features that are its reason for being. But the UI changes and tweaks in version 5 are delightful, and too long to list here. (E.g. the pin icon animation, and the gear menu animation.) The UI is so good that I encourage anyone who appreciates great UI design to download the demo and explore, examine, and think about the interface details of this app even if you have no interest in its features. </p>

<p>It’s both great UI design in the abstract, and a hall-of-fame caliber example of a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps">Mac-assed Mac app</a> in particular.</p>

    <p>My thanks to Rogue Amoeba for sponsoring DF last week to promote Loopback, their amazing Mac audio utility that makes it easy to move audio between applications. Stuck on Zoom calls? Pipe in music and sound effects, or enhance your microphone. Podcasters, merge your mic with other audio sources, then pass it all on to remote guests. Loopback makes seemingly impossible audio routing a breeze.</p>

<p>With virtual audio devices that are usable anywhere on MacOS, Loopback can route audio between software applications and hardware devices alike. The intuitive wire-based interface gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board, all with no cables required. For studio techs, live streamers, and so many others, Loopback is essential.</p>

<p>Download the free trial, then use coupon code <strong>LOOPFIRE</strong> to save $20 when you purchase by August 15. $20 discount, just for DF readers.</p>

    <p>Apple, in its legal filing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers encountering Applicant’s Mark are likely to associate
the mark with Apple. Applicant’s Mark consists of a minimalistic
fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind
Apple’s famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial
impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/misc/2020/08/prepear-apple-comparison.png">Here’s the comparison</a>. I could actually see this being a reasonable objection if Prepear were selling computers or phones or watches. But they’re a recipe app. Their logo clearly looks like a pear, not an apple, and their pear does not even look like an Apple-logo-like pear.</p>

<p>Back in the old days Apple didn’t even pursue legal action against the <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/banana2.html">Banana Junior series of personal computers</a>, and their logo was <a href="/misc/2020/08/banana.jpg">a six-color banana</a>.</p>
