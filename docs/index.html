    <p>My thanks to Wifi Dabba for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. I’ve never had a sponsor quite like Wifi Dabba — they’re looking for investors in the DF audience, not customers.</p>

<p>India is a huge battleground — maybe <em>the</em> battleground — for the soul of the open internet. Remember Facebook Basics from a few years ago, where Facebook tried to effectively own “the internet” in India with an offering that pretty much just offered Facebook’s own services? It didn’t work, but they’re back, having <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494033-facebook-to-invest-57-billion-in-indian-telecom-company">recently purchased a nearly $6 billion stake in India’s largest telco</a>. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally favor nation-states and existing telecom monopolies.</p>

<p>Wifi Dabba is attempting to solve India’s broadband problem from the bottom up. They’ve spent the last three years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. They use lasers instead of expensive underground fiber, and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100 times cheaper to deploy and 10 times cheaper for customers.</p>

<p>Right now they primarily serve their hometown of Bangalore, but are looking to expand nationwide. Their investors include YCombinator, VY Capital, and others — and they are looking for additional investors.</p>

    <p>From a CBS News survey over over 2,000 registered voters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number of U.S. deaths from coronavirus has been been acceptable /
unacceptable:</p>

<p>Republicans: 57% / 43% <br />
Democrats: 10% / 90% <br />
Independents: 33% / 67%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. has over 176,000 deaths, and that number is growing by around 1,000 per day. According to the same poll, 73 percent of Republicans think the U.S. response to coronavirus is “going well”. This isn’t cult<em>ish</em> — it’s a cult. Either a majority of Republicans are sociopaths or they’re so ignorant they have no idea how much worse the U.S. has handled COVID-19 than other industrialized nations. <a href="https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/1297580905851236354">Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas, on COVID-19 deaths reported yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Italy: 3 <br />
France: 9 <br />
Japan: 14 <br />
Canada: 7 <br />
UK: 18 <br />
Germany: 3  </p>

<p>United States: 974</p>

<p>Population of countries above: 439 million <br />
Population of United States: 328 million</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s almost <em>over</em> for other nations. Here in the U.S. COVID-19 is rampaging.</p>

        • by James Fallows

    <p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">In 1960, when he was still in his 30s and already a renowned novelist, Norman Mailer wrote about that year’s Democratic National Convention in an article for <em>Esquire</em> magazine. Mailer’s article was called “<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">Superman Comes to the Supermarket</a>,” and it was later hailed as one of the most important forebears of the <a href="https://longreads.com/2015/04/01/tom-wolfe-on-the-birth-of-the-new-journalism/">“New Journalism”</a> movement of the ’60s and ’70s. Mailer was never known for understatement, and he declared in this article—written after John F. Kennedy had won the Democratic nomination, but before he had edged past Richard Nixon to win the presidency—that the 1960 DNC in Los Angeles, larded as always with forgettable political speeches, might turn out to be “one of the most important conventions in America’s history, it could prove conceivably to be the most important.”</p><p dir="ltr">Why and how? Mailer’s answer sprawled out over 14,000 words of observation, meditation, and digression. But the argument centered on the nature of the man the Democrats had chosen. The glistening young Kennedy—still then an aspirant, not yet an icon of history—was “unlike any politician who had ever run for President in the history of the land, and if elected he would come to power in a year when America was in danger of drifting into a profound decline.”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><blockquote>He carried himself nonetheless with a cool grace which seemed indifferent to applause, his manner somehow similar to the poise of a fine boxer, quick with his hands, neat in his timing, and two feet away from his corner when the bell ended the round. …</blockquote><blockquote>There was an elusive detachment to everything he did.</blockquote><p></p><p dir="ltr">There is so very much more in this piece, which you can read in its full immensity <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">at the <em>Esquire</em> site</a>. (Jay Rosen wrote a wonderful, <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2004/07/21/mailer_con.html">detailed assessment of the piece</a>, back in 2004.) But during this past week’s convention, I thought of that one word in Mailer’s description: cool. Conventions have long been “hot”—loud, unsubtle, the political version of infomercials. The Democrats were forced by the pandemic to be cool, and every political gathering from now on will have to reckon with how effective they were. Starting this coming week, with the Republicans.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/democrats-nail-covid-convention/615442/?utm_source=feed">David Frum: Democrats nail the coronavirus convention</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">In the mid-’60s, Marshall McLuhan offered his <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media">famous delineation</a> of “hot” versus “cool” media. To oversimplify and put it in contemporary terms, hot media would be the infomercial salesman barking at you “Wait, there’s more!” in a 3 a.m. cable-TV spot. Cool media would be a storytelling podcast, inviting (and requiring) the listener to fill in the details of imagined scenes beyond what the narrator spells out.</p><p dir="ltr">That Kennedy was <em>cool</em>—not just in his look and personality but also in his approach to politics and persuasion—was one of many marker points in our political history. Obviously, not all politicians who came after Kennedy could match his cool, or even want to try. (As a rule, Americans tend to choose as the next president someone seen as correcting the flaws of the current one. This often leads to our sequence of temperamental and stylistic opposites: Ronald Reagan, after Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton, after the first George Bush. Barack Obama, after the second George Bush. And then …) But everyone who followed Kennedy had to be aware of what he had done and how he had changed the terrain.</p><p dir="ltr">Mailer couldn’t have known any of this when he wrote. But he set out the idea that there could be political changes few people fully imagine before they occur—but that seem almost inevitable once they have happened. Sixty years after Kennedy’s convention, I think we may have seen another such shift.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">Traditional conventions, with thousands of participants, scores of speakers, and countless opportunities to punditize and to schmooze, have been beloved by two kinds of people. Actually, they’re one kind—those whose business takes them to conventions—divided in two. One group is reporters who, like me, love the idea of seeing parts of history directly, with our own eyes, while mingling with others who share that passion. I consider myself lucky to have seen, in person, moments as consequential as the young Barack Obama making his debut at the Democratic convention in Boston 16 years ago, and the triumphant Donald Trump giving his acceptance speech in Cleveland four years ago. The vibe in each room was powerful and unforgettable, in their very different ways. (The group around me on the convention floor in Cleveland spent most of the evening chanting “Lock her up!”)</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/democratic-conventions-big-blind-spot-economy/615547/?utm_source=feed">Read: The missing piece in Biden’s convention speech</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">The other group is the participants—elected officials, staffers, volunteers, hangers-on, those already famous and those getting their start. People who go to conventions go precisely because of their messy spectacle and sprawl. What we love about conventions we would have loved if we’d been there to hear William Jennings Bryan give his “Cross of Gold” speech at the Democratic convention in 1896, or to watch Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller duke it out at the Republican convention in 1964.</p><p dir="ltr">But most people are not like us. Most have viewed the hot, sweaty, noisy, unsubtle conventions as inferior forms of entertainment, as out of date as William Jennings Bryan. Coverage hours have dwindled, and audiences have shrunk.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the virus, the Democrats couldn’t deliver the standard loud, sweaty fare. Now that their week is over, it’s “obvious” to everyone how much better, for nearly everyone, the streamlined, virtual approach is. Better for the party, in distilling a message (and not having it chopped up by procedural folderol or pundit assessments). Better for the viewer, in having their public issues presented in more varied, comprehensible, and simply interesting ways. Better with shorter speeches; better with less delay for ritualistic applause lines; better in pacing and tightness and focus. Better with presenters generally speaking <em>through</em> the camera, conversationally, to viewers one by one at home, rather than orating at a crowd. Better with more showing than telling, more explaining than lecturing. Just, better.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s obvious <em>now</em>—though I’m not aware of anyone predicting how much better a virtual convention would be, before it kicked off. (This is a point I discussed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/the-comedy-and-tragedy-of-virtual-live-events/615559/?utm_source=feed">last week on <em>Social Distance</em></a> with James Hamblin and Maeve Higgins.) And it will be obvious to the Republicans, as they ready their presentations for this week.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">How can what we’ve just seen from the DNC be considered “cool”? In simplest terms, because, compared with previous conventions, the Democrats were able to convey their themes more coherently than usual, with less old-fashioned speechifying about them.</p><p dir="ltr">In one way or another, every single minute of the DNC programming advanced one or more of these points and ideas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">the trademark slogan “Build Back Better,” which was the most normal-convention-like, and thus least memorable, of the whole affair;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Donald Trump is personally inadequate to the duties of office, yet also institutionally threatening;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Joe Biden is an imperfect but <em>decent</em> person, with whom you might disagree but whom you would probably like;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that America is badly wounded but is not finished;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that the Democrats are in this together and are not sniping at one another; and</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that you have to make sure to vote.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Think of the signature moments of these four nights, and how each was crafted to explain, to show, to underscore these ideas. It is churlish to pick out any one segment as “most effective.” Was it the fabulous reimagination of the roll call of states, which practically guarantees that this will never be done in the traditional way again? (Except perhaps in this coming week.) Was it Ady Barkan speaking through a computer because of ALS; or Gabby Giffords still relearning how to speak, nine years after her shooting; or 13-year-old Brayden Harrington magnificently persevering in his speech about stuttering? Was it Biden’s last major rival, Bernie Sanders, speaking with evident warmth for the man who had defeated him, or the Zoom-style panel of primary contenders sharing their memories of the campaign? Was it Jill Biden telling her story, or Kamala Harris telling hers, or Michelle and Barack Obama with their quiet-toned but deadly earnest message about the stakes in voting this year? Was it the tribute to John Lewis or the talk from Elizabeth Warren in a schoolroom, with children’s blocks spelling out <em>BLM</em> behind her? Was it Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, on what it will take to deal with the pandemic, or Kristin Urquiza saying that her dead father’s “only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump,” or (as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/dnc-when-convention-takes-place-your-living-room/615535/?utm_source=feed">Megan Garber argued</a>) the “In Memoriam” reflection on the many lives that had been lost? Was it Joe Biden’s implicit rebuke, in his closing address, to the constant Republican refrain that he had lost too many steps?</p><p dir="ltr">Was it—you can go on down your own list. The point for now is that the political world has seen something it hadn’t been aware of one week ago. The Democrats were forced out of the old, and figured out the new. They went from a hot medium, to one that was cool. In terms of political style, Donald Trump is pure heat. The rallies, the tweets, the boasts, the jibes. We’re about to see whether the party he leads will recognize the changed terrain, and how it might respond.</p><div class="feedflare">

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Jason Snell’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/put-anything-in-your-macs-menu-bar-with-bitbar/">recent post</a> on <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar">BitBar</a> inspired me to build a couple of menu bar notices of my own.</p>
<p>The first was a rewrite of <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/04/anybar-and-superduper/">the SuperDuper notice</a> I used to use with a similar menu bar utility called <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar">AnyBar</a>. It puts a thumbs up in the menu bar if the most recent scheduled SuperDuper backup was successful, and a thumbs down if it wasn’t. Clicking on the item brings up a summary of SuperDuper’s log file:</p>
<p><img alt="BitBar SuperDuper notice" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200821-BitBar%20SuperDuper%20notice.png" title="BitBar SuperDuper notice" width="70%"/></p>
<p>The log summary is in gray text because it doesn’t do anything—it’s like a series of disabled menu items.</p>
<p>The second BitBar notice is a little more complicated. It gets the status of items my family has checked out or on hold at our local library and presents them in the menu. If a checked-out item is due soon (or overdue) or if an item on hold is ready to be picked up, the book item in the menu bar is red; otherwise, it’s blue. Either way, the items are listed in the submenus.<sup id="fnref:nero"><a href="#fn:nero" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="BitBar Library" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200822-BitBar%20Library.png" title="BitBar Library" width="90%"/></p>
<p>In addition to the submenus, this one also allows some items in the menu to be chosen. If an item is due soon, it will be enabled in the menu, and choosing it will open Safari to the library’s login page. This speeds up renewing a book if I want to keep it longer.</p>
<p>BitBar uses the daunting words “plugin” and “API” to describe the code that configures these menu bar items, but they’re just programs that write lines of text to standard output. If you’ve ever written any kind of program in any language, you can write a BitBar plugin. There are <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#plugin-api">several rules</a> for the output, but the main ones are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple lines will be cycled through over and over.</li>
<li>If your output contains a line consisting only of <code>---</code>, the lines below it will appear in the dropdown for that plugin, but won’t appear in the menu bar itself.</li>
<li>Lines beginning with <code>--</code> will appear in submenus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You save the programs in a folder that you set up when you run BitBar the first time (before you have any plugins written). I use <code>~/.bitbar</code>.</p>
<p>My SuperDuper plugin, named <code>superduper.6h.py</code> in accordance with the <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#configure-the-refresh-time">BitBar plugin naming format</a>, is this Python script:</p>
<pre><code>python:
 1:  #!/usr/bin/python3
 2:  
 3:  import os
 4:  
 5:  # Where the SuperDuper! log files are.
 6:  logdir = (os.environ["HOME"] +
 7:            "/Library/Application Support/" +
 8:            "SuperDuper!/Scheduled Copies/" +
 9:            "Smart Update Backup from Macintosh HD.sdsp/Logs/")
10:  
11:  def sdinfo(s):
12:    "Return just the timestamp and process information from a SuperDuper line."
13:    parts = s.split('|')
14:    ratespot = parts[3].find("at an effective transfer rate")
15:    if ratespot &gt; -1:
16:      parts[3] = parts[3][:ratespot]
17:    detailspot = parts[3].find("(")
18:    if detailspot &gt; -1:
19:      parts[3] = parts[3][:detailspot]
20:    return "%s: %s" % (parts[1].strip(), parts[3].strip(' \\\n'))
21:  
22:  # Get the last log file.
23:  logfiles = [x for x in os.listdir(logdir) if x[-5:] == 'sdlog']
24:  logfiles.sort()
25:  lastlog = logdir + logfiles[-1]
26:  
27:  # Collect data for BitBar
28:  notices = []
29:  with open(lastlog) as f:
30:    for line in f:
31:      for signal in ["Started on", "PHASE:", "Copied", "Cloned", "Copy complete"]:
32:          if signal in line:
33:            notices.append(sdinfo(line))
34:  
35:  # Format output for BitBar
36:  if "Copy complete." in notices[-1]:
37:    print("👍🏻")
38:  else:
39:    print("👎🏻")
40:  print("---")
41:  print("\n".join(notices))
</code></pre>
<p>The bulk of this script was taken from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/05/a-slightly-better-superduper-summary/">the predecessor to my AnyBar script</a>, which I wrote for <a href="https://www.tynsoe.org/v2/geektool/">GeekTool</a>.<sup id="fnref:geek"><a href="#fn:geek" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It reads through the long SuperDuper log file and plucks out just the lines of interest, putting them in the list <code>notices</code>.</p>
<p>The last section, Lines 36–41, looks at the last item in <code>notices</code> to see if the backup finished. If it did, it prints a 👍🏻; if not, it prints a 👎🏻. Then comes the <code>---</code> separator in Line 40 to divide the menu title from the stuff in the dropdown. Finally, all the items in <code>notices</code> are printed line by line to populate the menu itself.</p>
<p>The library plugin, <code>library.3h.py</code>, consists of the following Python code, most of which was copied from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2009/03/library-loan-tracking-again/">an old script</a> that sends me a daily email with the status of the family library accounts.</p>

<p>The BitBar-specific stuff starts on Line 128. It’s more complicated than the SuperDuper script, in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character used for the menu title is based on two criteria instead of just one.</li>
<li>It has submenus, the items of which are distinguished by a <code>--</code> prefix.</li>
<li>It uses the <code>|color=#700000</code> suffix to make overdue or ready items red. I’ve found BitBar’s coloring of items somewhat sketchy. Often the items start off black and don’t turn red until I’ve moved the mouse over them, away from them, and then back over them again.</li>
<li>It uses the <code>|href=</code> suffix to enable the menu item and cause Safari to open the given URL when chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, there’s not much to the BitBar part of either of these scripts. Now I’m wondering what other informational scripts I have that can be converted into BitBar form.</p>

    <p>Indie developer Manton Reece <a href="https://www.manton.org/2020/08/22/jason-fried-on.html">linked to this interview with Basecamp’s Jason Fried</a> that gets to the heart of how independent developers respond to Apple’s heavy-handed approach to the App Store.</p>
<p>Here’s Fried, <a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/e1099-basecamp-co-founder-jason-fried-on-building-hey-making-email-exciting-again-hey-vs-apple-more/">as heard on This Week in Startups</a> (<a href="https://overcast.fm/+JyGg_X1w/59:28">Overcast link</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the Apple decision would have gone the other way, I was considered quitting, and basically retiring. […] Here’s why: I didn’t get into business — I didn’t start a business — to be told what to do by another business. […] We’re self-funded. We do everything our own way so that we can do it our own way. And to be in an industry where if Apple forced us to have to give them 30% of our business and not be able to interface with our customers the way we want, I don’t want to be in that industry.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s Reece:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Even more than the latest case with Epic Games, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">WordPress iOS rejected for weeks</a>, that quote from Jason highlights what this is all about. Apple’s total control over iPhone app distribution and payment is preventing developers from doing their best work. The App Store started with good intentions, to help users, but the rules have become twisted, corrupted as Apple gains power. It’s not right.
</p></blockquote>

    <p>The legal filings from Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21397369/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ios-microsoft-developer-tax">just keep on coming</a>, as Kim Lyons and Russell Brandom report at The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Epic has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite">asked the court</a> to restrain Apple from revoking that access while the case is ongoing. Apple responded to the request on Friday, emphasizing that it was enforcing previously stated policies, but not denying that iOS support was at risk.</p>
<p>  Epic says removing support would be unnecessarily punitive, affecting developers who have built on Epic’s engine but have no direct interest in the case…. The filing came alongside <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf">a new declaration</a> from Microsoft in support of Epic’s motion, emphasizing how disastrous it would be to revoke Epic’s access to Apple’s developer tools.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I dislike many of Apple’s App Store policies, and think they should change—but let’s be clear about this. Epic can revert the changes it made to the Fortnite app specifically to cause the incident and still continue its lawsuit against Apple. Epic is being strategically smart in pushing hard to get that restraining order, but I’m skeptical that legal intervention is called for when Epic can defuse this situation by returning to the status quo while it presses its case in court.</p>
<p>Given how calculating Epic has been about every step it has taken in this manufactured controversy, I also have to assume that it knew full well that Unreal Engine would be a target. Microsoft’s support of Epic is understandable, given the importance of Unreal Engine, but let’s remember that this is a situation entirely of Epic’s making. In the end, will Epic’s status as a legal provocateur make developers more or less likely to use Unreal Engine?</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21397369/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ios-microsoft-developer-tax">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/epic-to-apple-dont-bring-unreal-engine-into-this/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>It’s not every day you see an Apple apology, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">Matt Mullenweg of WordPress got one this week</a> after Apple—spectacularly failing to read the room—rejected the free open-source WordPress unless it added Apple’s in-app purchase system, because some web views in the app could lead to the display of premium WordPress<sup id="fnref-14542-wordpress"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-14542-wordpress" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> hosting plans.</p>
<p>Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved. Since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app, it is now a free stand-alone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases. We have informed the developer and apologize for any confusion that we have caused.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s great, but this entire situation shouldn’t have happened. Not only is it predicated on the dumbest of Apple’s App Store rule choices—banning links to a company’s web site if there’s any way to get to a page that might possibly insinuate that there’s a way to give them money that isn’t via in-app purchase—but the act of approaching WordPress and recommending in-app purchases feels an awful lot like a shakedown. (“If you want to stay in the App Store, you might want to start upselling your users right within your app and giving us 30 percent,” Mullenweg might have imagined Apple saying.)</p>
<p>Also troubling: Mullenweg only went public with Apple’s rejection because Apple had, <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1297325896274030593">weeks before</a>, told WordPress that Apple’s decision was final and that they’d need to alter their app to add in-app purchases in order to stay in the App Store. It was only after Mullenweg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088">original tweet</a> went viral that Apple re-examined the decision, backed down, and apologized.</p>
<p>This shows that the old (Steve Jobs? Phil Schiller?) guideline that “going to the press never helps” may be the most hilariously false thing Apple has ever produced.</p>
<p>But let’s consider the larger issues. What is wrong with the App Store approval system that a major vendor like WordPress would apparently be rejected in a way that would have been entirely final without the intervention of higher-ups? What is broken within the App Store’s culture that leads a developer to walk away feeling like his only option is to add commerce to his free app because of Apple’s apparent hunger to generate more in-app revenue?</p>
<p>And most troubling for the company and its prospects for the future: What does it say about Apple’s <em>reputation</em> in this area that so many of us jumped to the conclusion that Apple was just shaking down another developer in order to make more money?</p>

      • John D. Cook
      
        • by John
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/22/hebrew-latex/">Yesterday</a> I wrote about <code>cjhebrew</code>, a LaTeX package that lets you insert Hebrew text by using a sort of transliteration scheme. That reminded me of <code>unidecode</code>, a Python package for transliterating Unicode to ASCII, that I wrote about <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/01/09/projecting-unicode-to-ascii/">before</a>. I wondered how the two compare, and so this post will answer that question.</p>
<p>Transliteration is a crude approximation. I started to say it&#8217;s no substitute for a proper translation, but in fact sometimes it <em>is</em> a substitute for a proper translation. It takes in the smallest context possible—one character—and is utterly devoid of nuance, but it still might be good enough for some purposes. It might, for example, help in searching some text for relevant content worth the effort of a proper translation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short bit of code to display <code>unidecode</code>&#8216;s transliterations of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<pre>    for i in range(22+5):
        ch = chr(i + ord('א'))
        print(ch, unidecode.unidecode(ch))
</pre>
<p>I wrote 22 + 5 rather than 27 above to give a hint that the extra values are the final forms of five letters [1]. Also if <code>ord('א')</code> doesn&#8217;t work for you, you can replace it with <code>0x05d0</code>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison of the transliterations used in <code>cjhebrew</code> and <code>unidecode</code>. I&#8217;ve abbreviated the column headings to make a narrower table.</p>
<pre>|---------+---+----+----|

| U+05e9  | ש | /s | SH |
| U+05ea  | ת | t  | t  |
|---------+---+----+----|
</pre>
<p>The transliterations are pretty similar, despite different design goals. The <code>unidecode</code> module is trying to pick the best mapping to ASCII characters. The <code>cjhebrew</code> package is trying to use mnemonic ASCII sequences to map into Hebrew. The former doesn&#8217;t need to be unique, but the latter does. The <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/22/hebrew-latex/">post on cjhebrew</a> explains, for example, that it uses capital letters for final forms of Hebrew letters.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the corresponding table for vowel points (<em>niqqud</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Granite-coated non-stick cookware</strong><br />
For years, my family has been using Le Creuset cast iron pans. The large one is almost too heavy for my wife to deal with. Also, they take a long time to heat up. While we are not ready to get rid of them, I recently discovered <a href="https://geni.us/carote?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Carote non-stick frying pans</a>. They’re coated with some kind of natural Granite material and they have a bakelite handle that stays cool (unlike the Le Creuset handles that get extremely hot). The aluminum Carote heats up quickly, and it is the best non-stick frying pan I’ve ever had. Everything just slides right out of it and it’s very easy to clean with water and a paper towel. you can try out the 8-inch frying pan, which costs under $15 to see if you like it before buying a larger pan. — MF</p>

    <p>Two polynomials <em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>q</em>(<em>x</em>) are said to be permutable if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>p</em>(<em>q</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>q</em>(<em>p</em>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>. It&#8217;s not hard to see that Chebyshev polynomials are permutable.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>) = cos (<em>n </em>arccos(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>where <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is the <em>n</em>th Chebyshev polyomial. You can take this as a definition, or if you prefer another approach to defining the Chebyshev polynomials it&#8217;s a theorem.</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s easy to show that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">cos(<em>m</em> arccos(cos(<em>n</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)))) = cos(<em>mn</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<p>Then the polynomials <em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> and <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> must be permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>) = <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more family of polynomials that are permutable, and that&#8217;s the power polynomials <em>x</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>. They are trivially permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(<em>x</em><sup><em>m</em></sup>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> = (<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>)<sup><em>m</em></sup>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Chebyshev polynomials and the power polynomials are essentially [1] the only permutable sequence of polynomials.</p>

</ul>
<p>[1] Here&#8217;s what &#8220;essentially&#8221; means. A set of polynomials, at least one of each positive degree, that all permute with each other is called a <strong>chain</strong>. Two polynomials <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are <strong>similar</strong> if there is an affine polynomial</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">λ(<em>x</em>)<em> = <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em></em></p>
<p>such that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) = λ<sup>-1</sup>( <em>q</em>( λ(<em>x</em>) ) ).</p>
<p>Then any permutable chain is similar to either the power polynomials or the Chebyshev polynomials.

      • John D. Cook

    <p>I was looking up how to put a little Hebrew inside a LaTeX document and ran across a good answer on <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14777/whats-a-simple-way-to-typeset-a-small-amount-of-hebrew-content-using-tex/15550#15550">tex.stackexchange</a>. Short answer: use the <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/cjhebrew">cjhebrew</a> package.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you put your Hebrew text between <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> using the <code>cjhebrew</code> package&#8217;s transliteration. You write left-to-right, and the text will appear right-to-left. For example, <code>\&lt;'lp&gt;</code> produces</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/aleph_cjhebrew.png" alt="aleph in Hebrew" width="99" height="56" /></p>
<p>using &#8216; for א, l for ל, and p for ף.</p>
<p>The code for each Hebrew letter is its English transliteration, with three footnotes.</p>
<p>First, when two Hebrew letters roughly correspond to the same English letter, one form may have a dot in front of it. For example, ט and ת both make a <em>t</em> sound; the former is encoded as <code>.t</code> and the latter as <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>Second, five Hebrew letters have a different form when used at the end of a word [1]. For such letters the final form is the capitalized value of the regular form. For example, פ and its final form ף are denoted by <code>p</code> and <code>P</code> respectively. The package will automatically choose between regular and final forms, but you can override this by using the capital letter in the middle of a word or by using a <code>|</code> after a regular form at the end of a word.</p>
<p>Finally, the letter ש is written with a <code>/s</code> The author already used <code>s</code> for ס and <code>.s</code> for צ, so he needed a new symbol to encode a third letter corresponding to <em>s</em> [2]. Also ש has a couple other forms. The letter can make either the <em>sh</em> or <em>s</em> sound, and you may see dots on top of the letter to distinguish these. The <code>cjhebrew</code> package uses <code>+s</code> for ש with a dot on the top right, the <em>sh</em> sound, and <code>,s</code> for ש with a dot on the top left, the <em>s</em> sound.</p>
<p>Here is the complete consonant transliteration table from the <code>cjhebrew</code> documentation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/cjhebrew.png" width="878" height="216" /></p>
<p>Note that the code for א is a single quote <code>'</code> and the code for ע is a back tick (grave accent) <code>`</code>.</p>
<p>You can also add vowel points (<em>niqqud</em>). These are also represented by their transliteration to English sounds, with one exception. The sh&#8217;va is either silent or represents a schwa sound, so there&#8217;s not a convenient transliterations. But the sh&#8217;va looks like a colon, so it is represented by a colon. See the package documentation for more details.</p>

<p>[1] You may have seen something similar in Greek with sigma σ and final sigma ς. Even English had something like this. For example, people used to use a different form of <em>t</em> at the end of a word when writing cursive. My mother wrote this way.</p>
<p>[2] It would be more phonetically faithful to transliterate צ as ts, but that would make the LaTeX package harder to implement since it would have to disambiguate whether <code>ts</code> represents צ or תס.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/22/hebrew-latex/" target="_blank">Including a little Hebrew in an English LaTeX document</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/" target="_blank">John D.

    <p>A few days ago <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-seriously-considers-capital-gains-tax-cut-heres-how-he-could-do-it-2020-08-11">President Trump said he was &#8220;seriously considering&#8221; a cut in the capital gains rate</a> if he&#8217;s re-elected. Needless to say, Trump says a lot of things, and the fact that he said this probably doesn&#8217;t mean much. Still, he was backed up by longtime capital gains warrior Larry Kudlow, who told reporters &#8220;We’d like to take it back to 15%, where it was for quite a long time because it helps jobs, investment, productivity and wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that true? First off, here&#8217;s the amateur view of whether capital gains rates have any effect on economic growth:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861073"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861073" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_capital_gains_gdp_growth.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="619"></figure>
<p>Hmmm. It sure doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like the capital gains rate has much correlation with real GDP growth. If anything, the trend lines are going in the wrong direction entirely: capital gains rates have been declining since 1960, but the only result has been a decline in GDP growth too. If low capital gains rates boost GDP, it sure doesn&#8217;t show up here.</p>
<p>But this is just playground stuff. Serious economists have far more sophisticated ways of figuring out if capital gains cuts lead to higher economic growth. So what do they say?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42729-orig.pdf">Congressional Research Service report</a> written in 2012 concludes that &#8220;neither the top marginal tax rate nor the top capital gains tax rate are strongly correlated with saving, investment, labor productivity, and GDP growth controlling for other covariates.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/raising-todays-low-capital-gains-tax-rates-could-promote-economic-efficiency-and-fairness#_ftnref6">Tax expert Joel Slemrod</a> says &#8220;there is no evidence that links aggregate economic performance to capital gains tax rates.&#8221;</li>
<li>A policy brief from the <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/capital-gains-taxes-and-economic-growth">Levy Economics Institute</a> finds &#8220;little theoretical or empirical basis for the view that lowering the capital gains tax rate would have a substantial effect on economic growth or level of economic activity.&#8221;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2019/11/21/policy-options-increase-tax-rates-on-capital-gains-amp-dividends">Penn Wharton Budget Model</a> calculates that an <em>increase</em> in the capital gains rate would have no negative effect on economic growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-019-09530-3">A pair of researchers at the University of Groningen</a> looked at capital gains rates worldwide and concluded that &#8220;Using a long cross-country panel data set going back to 1965 and employing a variety of econometric techniques, we document that greater reliance on capital taxation, measured in different ways, is not negatively associated with growth rates.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but why bother? There&#8217;s been a ton of research on this subject and it almost unanimously concludes that capital gains rates have a tiny effect at most on economic growth. On the other hand, when capital gains rates are different from ordinary tax rates they can cause serious mischief:</p>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/01/18/mitt-romneys-teachable-moment-on-capital-gains/#7aa1c0057a4e">Len Burman</a> says, &#8220;Virtually every individual income tax shelter is devoted to converting fully taxed income into capital gains.&#8221;</li>
<li>Capital gains tax cuts are regressive, with the benefits going almost exclusively to the rich. The <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/9-19-12tax.pdf">Tax Policy Center</a> estimates that 71 percent of the benefits go to the top one percent.<br />
<figure id="attachment_861081"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861081" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_capital_gains_benefits.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="922"></figure>
</li>
<li>Many affluent households earn a majority of their income in capital gains. This means that some of them actually have lower overall tax rates than middle-class households, who have to pay the ordinary income tax rate. Lowering the capital gains rate would only make this worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. It&#8217;s no surprise that rich people—and therefore the Republican Party—are in favor of reducing capital gains rates. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be? But there&#8217;s no reason for the other 99 percent of us to be in favor. It does the economy no good; it does us no good; and it motivates lots of inefficient gameplaying with taxes. It&#8217;s just another stupid con. Don&#8217;t fall for it if your income is anywhere below $200,000 or so.</p>

<h5>“Lowering Boats”: Detail from a 1927 illustration by Clifford Warren Ashley (1881-1947).&#0160; New Bedford Whaling Museum, via Wikimedia.</h5>
<p>All his life, from childhood into old age, Arthur Conan Doyle was as bold and adventurous as his literary creations and fictional dual alter egos Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. For him the game was always afoot. At one time the game was literally game, as in animals to be hunted, and those animals were not afoot but a-fin! As an impecunious twenty-two-year old med student, Doyle took time off from his studies to earn tuition money by signing on as a ship’s doctor aboard a whaler bound for the Arctic. He had a, um, whale of time. Oh, and about poisoning himself: he did that as part of a research experiment he was doing on the effects of a pain relief medicine derived from a toxic plant...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many dangers awaited Arthur at sea in the Arctic. Frequently he even found himself in the water. He fell off the slippery decks or icy floes often enough that the sardonic captain nicknamed him the “Great American Diver,” after the fishing bird known in North America as the common loon. As the medical man and an educated young gentleman, he was not expected to participate in the hunts. Eager for adventure and fond of blood sports, however, he rowed out to whales in impossibly tiny tossing boats, and looked a dying whale in the eye. He bludgeoned and skinned seals and shot walrus. He sent occasional reports home to his mother, telling her more details than most mothers would want to know, as if teasing her with the dangers and risks of this work he did not have to do---but which he embraced. Piercing cold, strangely lit nights, and alien creatures crept into his imagination. He had proved himself with common men and officers, had faced the cold and the darkness and grown stronger. The Arctic cowed him no more than the poison with which he had dosed him the year before.</p>

<p>“It will change my future,” Harrington, 13, told Nightly News’ Lester Holt in an appearance that will air Friday night. “And I have this thought going around my head that I kind of want to be a therapist when I grow up to help other children in need and other people in need. And that just really is heartwarming to me because some people really need some help with what’s going on.”</p>

    <p>In his column today Paul Krugman flicked at a point about the &#8220;soaring&#8221; stock market that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/opinion/stock-market-unemployment.html">deserves a bit more attention:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent rise in the market has been largely driven by a small number of technology giants. And the market values of these companies have very little to do with their current profits, let alone the state of the economy in general. <strong>Instead, they’re all about investor perceptions of the fairly distant future.</strong></p>
<p>Take the example of Apple, with its $2 trillion valuation. Apple has a price-earnings ratio — the ratio of its market valuation to its profits — of about 33. One way to look at that number is that only around 3 percent of the value investors place on the company reflects the money they expect it to make over the course of the next year. <strong>As long as they expect Apple to be profitable years from now, they barely care what will happen to the U.S. economy over the next few quarters.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longtime readers know that when I say something &#8220;deserves a bit more attention,&#8221; that means you&#8217;re about to see a chart. Here it is:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861049"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1266px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861049" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_sp500_ex_tech.gif" alt="" width="1266" height="632"></figure>
<p>This is an S&amp;P 500 index with tech stocks removed and adjusted for inflation. You can see two things. First, over the past three years it&#8217;s not very impressive. Second, it plunged in March thanks to COVID-19 and has never recovered completely.</p>
<p>(And that&#8217;s even though this index includes powerhouses like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, none of which are categorized as &#8220;information technology.&#8221;)</p>
<p>In one sense you don&#8217;t want to make too much of this. You can always remove the top performer from a broad stock index and produce a weaker looking trend. Still, this is more dramatic than usual. This isn&#8217;t just weaker looking, it&#8217;s practically flat. The collective performance of literally everything in the United States is kind of dismal except for companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle.</p>
<p>So when someone asks why the stock market is doing so great even though we&#8217;re in the middle of a massive pandemic, this is part of the answer: it&#8217;s <em>not</em> doing so great. Aside from tech stocks, the market has been ho-hum over the past few years and is still down 4 percent from its pre-pandemic level. Investors obviously have some confidence that the economy will rebound once we approve a vaccine and the pandemic is finally sidelined—as they should—but they&#8217;re hardly being cheerleaders for the overall economy. They just like tech stocks.</p>

    <p>Devin Coldewey, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s filing challenges the TRO request on several grounds.
First, it contends that there is no real “emergency” or
“irreparable harm” because the entire situation was concocted and
voluntarily initiated by Epic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having decided that it would rather enjoy the benefits of the App
Store without paying for them, Epic has breached its contracts
with Apple, using its own customers and Apple’s users as
leverage.</p>

<p>But the “emergency” is entirely of Epic’s own making…it knew full
well what would happen and, in so doing, has knowingly and
purposefully created the harm to game players and developers it
now asks the Court to step in and remedy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple also questions the likelihood of Epic’s main lawsuit
(independent of the TRO request) succeeding on its merits — namely that Apple is exercising monopoly power in its
rent-collecting on the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Epic’s] logic would make monopolies of Microsoft, Sony and
Nintendo, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Epic’s antitrust theories, like its orchestrated campaign, are a
transparent veneer for its effort to co-opt for itself the
benefits of the App Store without paying or complying with
important requirements that are critical to protect user safety,
security, and privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I see a lot of people arguing that iOS, in some ethical/moral/philosophical sense, is inherently a different sort of closed vendor-controlled computing platform than game consoles, but I don’t see a legal argument for how iOS constitutes a monopoly if Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch aren’t. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/sweeney_hand_waving_game_consoles_app_stores">Again</a>, you’re not going to see Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo filing amicus briefs on Epic’s behalf, even though Microsoft has a game streaming platform Apple’s won’t allow on iOS, and Sony and Nintendo <em>could</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/#entry-36">Apple’s full filing is available here</a>, and their attachments, including <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Phil Schiller’s declaration</a> and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/4/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Tim Sweeney’s laughably absurd “How about we make our own app store?” email</a>, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/#entry-37">are right below it</a>.</p>
