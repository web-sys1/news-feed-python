    <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8">Ben Gilbert, reporting yesterday for Business Insider</a> (italic emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This September, Microsoft plans to launch a major coup in the
video game business: The world’s first game streaming service with
a built-in library, Netflix-style. For $15 a month, you’ll be able
to stream over 100 games to smartphones and tablets — but it
won’t be available on Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><em>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because
Apple isn’t able to review each game that’s available through
Game Pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness">controversy over Basecamp’s Hey app</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Tim Cook being called to testify at an antitrust Congressional hearing</a> regarding App Store policies, and given the high profile of Xbox Game Pass, it’s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200806/p45#a200806p45">has gotten a lot of attention</a>, almost all of it focused on taking the italicized paragraph from Business Insider at its word. But that’s Ben Gilbert’s interpretation, not a quote from Apple. Gilbert’s interpretation is not an unfair or sensationalized take on Apple’s statement, but it’s adding a “because” that Apple did not state. That entire sentence is <em>not</em> a paraphrase of something Apple said.</p>

<p>Here is Apple’s statement to Business Insider, apparently in its entirety. Apple seemingly sent this statement <em>only</em> to Business Insider, which itself is a bit unusual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for
customers to discover and download apps, and a great business
opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all
apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are
intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing
field to developers.</p>

<p>Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of
developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App
Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users
over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running this statement through my Applespeak-to-English decoder ring, what I hear is not that they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game separately. What I hear is that game streaming services are not allowed in the iOS App Store. Period, full stop. I don’t even think this has anything to do with whether Microsoft offers in-app subscriptions, or whether those subscriptions get a discount from the standard 70/30 split for the first year. I think Apple’s stance is that game streaming services like Microsoft’s xCloud project are simply verboten.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-07">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2.7">App Store guideline 4.2.7</a>, “Remote Desktop Clients”, seemingly makes this clear, too — it’s a written rule, not an unwritten one. This rule is why <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about">Steam Link</a> is in the App Store and Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia are not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is
    a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the
    user, and both the host device and client must be connected on
    a local and LAN-based network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like this: Business Insider asked Apple why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass. Apple didn’t say why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass, and instead gave a non-answer answer by describing what they do allow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submitting games individually and appearing in charts and search — presumably App Store charts and search — is just an obfuscated way of saying that native iOS game apps are allowed in the iOS App Store. Well, duh. Everyone is distracted by the interpretation that Apple won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game. It is a nonsensical justification, no doubt about that. But the comparison to Netflix or Spotify is beside the point. Of course Apple doesn’t and can’t review every movie on Netflix or every song on Spotify. But if you think about it, they <em>could</em> review every game on Xbox Game Pass. Even if it’s 100 games, they could look at them all. I’m sure they could find quite a few volunteers among the App Store reviewer corps to spend the time to play these games thoroughly.</p>

<p>The point is that streaming video and music services are allowed in the App Store; streaming software (games or otherwise) is not, unless it works over the web. <em>Apple just doesn’t want to say that.</em> Here, in my opinion, is how this conversation is best decoded:</p>

<p><strong>Business Insider</strong>: <em>Why are game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass not allowed in the App Store?</em></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong>: <em>Native iPhone games are allowed in the App Store. Native iPhone games are good because we review them individually, and they appear in App Store charts and search results.</em></p>

<p>It’s a perfect example of the difference between bullshit and a lie. Every word in Apple’s statement is true, but not a word of it answers why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass or any other cloud game streaming service.</p>

<p>Apple would have been much better off saying nothing at all than offering this bullshit non-answer answer, that in fact was so easily and reasonably misconstrued. And, purely as a guess on my part, I think Apple realized this, which is why they didn’t send this statement to any other outlet and haven’t added a word of clarification since.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just about the money, or even partially about the money<sup id="fnr2-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn2-2020-08-07">2</a></sup> — which certainly wouldn’t be shocking — but we don’t know, because Apple didn’t say, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/">neither did Microsoft in its own testily worded statement</a>, which, unlike Apple’s statement, was distributed to numerous news outlets.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2020-08-07">
<p>I really hope it’s <em>not</em> about the money. I mean let’s face it, no matter what the story is here, it’s sad in some way. Microsoft has made something technically impressive and cool and fun, and millions of Xbox-playing iOS users would love to play these games on their iPhones and iPads and but they can’t because of some sort of business or strategic shit that’s between Apple and Microsoft. But if it’s really just a dispute about goddamn money — between, of all companies, two of the richest in the history of the world — man, that’s just tawdry. It’s just two <em>corporations</em> fighting over one more stream of money neither even knows what to do with atop the Scrooge McDuckian mountains of cash they each already have flooding into their coffers each day. That’s business, but that’s a stale saltine of a story.</p>

<p>But what if it’s <em>not</em> Apple being a dick about money? What if it’s Apple being a dick about control?</p>

<p>That’s not cold and dry — that’s a goddamn sizzling hot juicy steak of a story. That’s <em>personal</em>. For one thing it would explain the pissy, petulant tone of Microsoft’s statement. Maybe Microsoft went into this whole endeavor gearing up for a knockdown drag-out knife-fight negotiation about how exactly to split the money, and Apple just went stone cold <a href="https://youtu.be/wPmTp9up26w?t=87">Michael Corleone on them</a>: “<em>You can have our answer now, if you like. Our offer is this: nothing. Not even the 30 percent fee for the gaming subscription, which we would appreciate if you put up your ass.</em>” The idea being, in this scenario, that Apple has something Microsoft needs, Microsoft has nothing to offer in return that Apple wants, and so Microsoft just has to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZhj7rPPzxg">sit there grooving on it</a>, stuck with a premium paid subscription service that’s only available on the low-rent mobile platform <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">where people don’t pay for things</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is clearly being a dick to Microsoft about <em>something</em> here, and if it’s platform control not money, well by god at least there’s some delicious poetic justice at play. That’d be a veritable vintage bottle of wine being uncorked. Not having any control over the world’s most lucrative computing platform and wanting something from the company that does — and which has a real taste for exerting its dictatorial control over said platform in mercurial fashion — would fucking suck, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

  <p>Since the first days after she was elected governor of South Dakota in 2018, Kristi Noem had been working to ensure that President Trump would come to Mount Rushmore for a fireworks-filled July 4 extravaganza.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2018/04/24/president-donald-trump-mount-rushmore-trumpmore/544597002/">the president had told her</a> in the Oval Office that he aspired to have his image etched on the monument. And last year, a White House aide reached out to the governor’s office with a question, according to a Republican official familiar with the conversation: What’s the process to add additional presidents to Mount Rushmore? […]</p>

<p>In private, the efforts to charm Mr. Trump were more pointed, according to a person familiar with the episode: Ms. Noem greeted him with a four-foot replica of Mount Rushmore that included a fifth presidential likeness: his.</p>

    <p>A major college conference has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/08/mac-fall-football-postponed/">canceled its fall sports:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Mid-American Conference postponed its football season,</strong> the conference announced Saturday, becoming the first Football Bowl Subdivision league to decide not to hold games this fall because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8230;.“<strong>The decision is grounded in the core values of the Conference that prioritize student-athlete well-being,</strong> an area the MAC has traditionally taken a leadership role,” Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s good to see a college sports conference putting its athletes first even if it means losing—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many MAC schools rely on the revenue generated through guarantee games — when a Power Five school pays another program to play it during the nonconference schedule. <strong>Most of these games have been canceled</strong> because all of the Power Five leagues have chosen to play one or zero nonconference games this season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, I see. Without any of these guarantee games, football suddenly becomes a money loser for MAC schools. And just as suddenly, the well-being of the players becomes paramount and the season is canceled. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Big Ten has canceled its football season too. I&#8217;m sure all the other dominoes will now fall as well.</p>
<p>With no fans in the stands, I imagine that football is a money loser even for Power Five schools. That probably made it a lot easier to do the right thing.</p>

    <p>Most of Apple’s early laptops were, like today’s MacBooks, <em>complete</em> Macs. The premise was: “Let’s engineer a Mac that’s like the one on your desk, but put it in a single package with screen, keyboard, pointing device, and battery.” My first laptop was a PowerBook 160 and it did everything my old Mac SE did (and much, much more).</p>
<p>The PowerBook Duo was different. It wasn’t trying to be the Mac on your desk.<br>
Introduced in 1992,<sup id="fnref-12646-160"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-160" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> it was the MacBook Air or one-port MacBook of its time—all compromise in a quest to be as thin and light as possible. If you wanted the absolutely smallest, lightest Mac laptop you could find, you got a PowerBook Duo and dealt with the weirdness.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duo-air-buddies.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Separated at birth? The PowerBook Duo was the MacBook Air of its day, prioritizing thinness and lightness over “required” features.</figcaption></figure><p>How small and how light? By today’s standards <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2897715/the-new-macbook-is-cool-but-the-powerbook-duo-was-cooler.html">the PowerBook Duo was laughably large</a>, but 1992 was a different time. My first PowerBook weighed seven pounds; the first PowerBook Duo weighed four. It  was also 1.4 inches thick—more than an inch thinner than my PowerBook.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a complete Mac. It had a shrunken-down keyboard and trackball, and only a single standard port. (Sound familiar, MacBook fans?) There was no support for floppy drives, external hard drives or monitors. For all of that stuff, you needed to connect it to a docking station.</p>
<p>Today we don’t flinch at the idea of a computer without a built-in floppy drive, but back in the mid-90s, floppies were the currency of the realm. <em>Even six years later,</em> people screamed bloody murder when the original iMac was released lacking a floppy drive. The Duo? Nope. (If you needed access to floppies, you’d need to buy an external disk drive.)</p>
<p>It also didn’t have a headphone jack! This one seems completely bananas now—I can’t imagine working on a laptop out in public without plugging in headphones. But back then, we didn’t really play music on our computers—this was the Walkman era—so Apple got away with shaving that port off.</p>
<p>The only standard port on the Duo, hiding behind a little door that you could rotate and turn into a foot to help angle the keyboard perfectly for carpal tunnel syndrome<sup id="fnref-12646-rsi"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-rsi" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>, was a single Mac serial port. That wasn’t nothing, because you could use it to connect to a modem (if you didn’t pay for the optional internal modem) or a printer or even a very slow local-area network via LocalTalk. But, that was it.</p>
<p>And this is where the PowerBook Duo got…interesting. It remains the only Mac to be built with an Apple docking station in mind. Apple sold two of them, and third-party vendors filled in the gaps with all sorts of other contraptions, all connected via the Duo’s most important (and most nonstandard) port, the 156-pin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot">Processor Direct Slot</a>.</p>
<p>When I say “Mac docking station,” you probably can imagine what I’m talking about. When I was a full-time PowerBook and MacBook user, I used a bunch of third-party ones—you’d connect your monitor, speakers, hard drive, and other stuff to a plastic frame and then slide your laptop into it to make the connections and hopefully not ruin the ports on the back or sides.</p>
<p>And yes, the Duo had those kinds of docks. It was the original Dongletown. Apple’s <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duo_minidock.html">Duo MiniDock</a> clipped on the back and added a modem jack, audio-in and audio-out plugs, a SCSI port, two serial ports, video out, ADB for keyboards and mice, a floppy-disk port, and an AC adapter. (If that seemed like too much, there was also a Duo Floppy Adapter, that added a floppy-disk port <em>and</em> an ADB port.)</p>
<p>But docking stations like that are kind of boring. What you wanted to do, if you were John Sculley-era Apple, was to create a big, bold docking station that could transform that tiny PowerBook Duo into a full-fledged desktop Mac. You wanted to create the <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duodock.html">Duo Dock</a>, the accessory that makes the PowerBook Duo more significant than it would be if it were just Apple’s first attempt to make a tiny laptop.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duodock.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Duo Dock (with Duo inside). The two-tone color scheme matched PowerBook and monitor alike.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what MacUser’s Russell Ito wrote in his launch story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let’s get one thing clear: This thing looks weird. We’re not talking technology or functionality, mind you, just aesthetics. From its two-tone finish (platinum on top, granite on the bottom—according to Apple, the top will match your monitor, and the bottom, your PowerBook), to its partially melted-looking lid, to its strange cylindrical feet sticking out the sides, this is easily the most visually “unusual” computer Apple has produced since the Lisa.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I prefer to think of the Duo Dock as a front-loading VCR that takes laptops instead of videocassettes<sup id="fnref-12646-vcr"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-vcr" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>. Because that’s how it worked. You closed your Duo and inserted it into the tray of the Duo Dock, which would eventually click into place and pull itself snugly closed. In a decade when Apple never skimped on custom intercapped names for their products, the system that locked the Duo in place in the Duo Dock was called PowerLatch.</p>
<p>The Duo Dock packed in all the parts of a desktop Mac that weren’t present on the Duo. There was a floppy drive (not just a connector, like on the MiniDock), a hard-drive bay for a single 3.5-inch half-height drive, two NuBus slots—that’s right, you could install add-on cards that the computer could use when it was docked—space for additional video RAM (to drive larger monitors), and even a slot for a floating-point unit (FPU) chip. This was a dock that could actually expand your computer’s central processor and make it faster.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerlatch-duo.gif?ssl=1" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Patented PowerLatch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology.</figcaption></figure><p>That level of integration came at a cost: You basically needed to shut down your laptop to eject it from the Dock. If you pressed the eject button on the Dock—yes, there was an eject button—it would tell the Duo to shut down, and you’d be prompted to save your files. Once the laptop was off, the ejection process would start. (When you inserted a Duo in the Dock, it would automatically reconnect you to your file servers, which was nice.)</p>
<p>Still, the idea of the Duo Dock was kind of brilliant. I frequently hear the hosts of <a href="http://atp.fm/">one of my favorite podcasts</a> debate the merits of going full-time with a laptop versus having a separate laptop and desktop. The Duo tried to provide the best of both worlds, with a light laptop that could inherit the traits of a desktop Mac when it was sucked into its little plastic house.</p>
<p>The lifespan of the entire PowerBook Duo product line from introduction to discontinuation was less than five years. But it lives on in reruns of NewsRadio, Seinfeld, and quintessential mid-90s films like “The Net” (which was shot at Macworld Expo San Francisco) and “Hackers.”</p>
<p>This time period coincides with my first few years working at MacUser magazine. I had never seen a Duo in the wild before I started to work at MacUser, and even there, they were rare. In an era that stands among the worst in Apple’s history, the full-featured PowerBook was a hit, but not the Duo. It lived off in its own parallel universe, a niche within a niche.</p>
<p>The Duo line was discontinued in early 1997, before Steve Jobs got the chance to kill it himself. Though <a href="https://512pixels.net/2011/09/modern-docking-station/">you could make the argument</a> that Apple’s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162442/2011/09/apples_thunderbolt_display_a_compelling_device_for_2011_macbook_air.html?lsrc=top_1">Thunderbolt Display</a> was a MacBook docking station disguised as a display, we never really saw the Duo Dock’s like again.</p>

    <p>Donald Trump has issued some executive orders related to coronavirus aid, and I suppose we&#8217;re all supposed to take them seriously. But why? To paraphrase an old saying, the stuff that&#8217;s legal is unimportant and the stuff that&#8217;s important is illegal. It&#8217;s just more Trump blather designed to keep the spotlight on him.</p>
<p>But I suppose you want a little more than that. Fine. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first EO provides a $400 unemployment bonus. This is important, but almost certainly not legal. The money is supposed to be transferred from unspent FEMA accounts, which is a transfer that Trump probably can&#8217;t make. What&#8217;s more, Trump wants states to pick up 25 percent of the cost, and he definitely can&#8217;t do that. The Supreme Court made that clear when it struck down Obamacare&#8217;s Medicaid mandate. What&#8217;s even yet more, even if all this were legal, the money would only last five weeks.</li>
<li>The second EO defers payroll taxes from September through December. This is probably legal, but deeply trivial. The amount of money involved is small. It helps only people who are already employed. And the deferred taxes have to be paid back in a lump sum in January. It&#8217;s pointless.</li>
<li>A third EO asks federal agencies to &#8220;consider&#8221; whether evictions should be temporarily halted. This is obviously legal, but has no impact at all.</li>
<li>Finally, the fourth EO defers student loan payments through the end of the year. This is legal, and maybe even modestly important. However, like the payroll tax deferral, it will primarily help out people who are the most likely to still have jobs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am deeply tired of these idiotic Republican games. Because that&#8217;s all they seem to be to them: games. There are millions of Americans in deep, deep trouble because of the coronavirus, and they&#8217;re in even deeper trouble than they should be thanks to Trump&#8217;s gross mismanagement of the crisis. But none of that seems to matter to any of them. Human suffering is just another political lever to be used in service of God only knows what political aim they have at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all so appalling and loathsome. I can barely stand reading about it any longer, let alone writing about it.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 9. You may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post new numbers on Sunday. I normally do them the night before, but on Saturday night I was tired and it just didn&#8217;t happen. Then Sunday was crash day and I didn&#8217;t fully wake up until about 2 pm. By then it seemed kind of pointless, so I just skipped it. Today, however, we have nice, fresh numbers and Argentina is starting to look really, really bad.</p>
<p>The raw data from Johns Hopkins is <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv">here.</a></p>

      • And now it’s all this

    </p></div>
    <p>After posting my <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/08/development-shortcuts-and-warhol/">Warhol shortcut</a>, I got a couple of good suggestions for improvements. They overlapped to some extent, so I put them together into <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/74ccef08af784e78abfe8a4448f8ae9b">a new Warhol</a>.</p>
<p>First, David Sparks pointed out that it would be helpful to end the shortcut by opening Photos so you can both see the new image and do something with it. And Leddy, <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/dr-drang-s-warhol-shortcut/7901">in the Automators discussion forum</a>, had a suggestion for running it both the Share Sheet and directly from Shortcuts without running into memory constraints. As I was trying out Leddy’s suggestion, I learned that Warhol <em>wasn’t</em> constrained by memory when run from the Share Sheet. (Apparently I’d run into that problem during one of the the early iterations of Warhol and never went back to check if the later improvements made it efficient enough to avoid the memory constraint.)</p>
<p>So now Warhol can be run from both Shortcuts and the Share Sheet in Photos. If it’s run from Shortcuts, it finishes by opening Photos. If it’s run from the Share Sheet, Photos is already open.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in the improved Warhol:</p>

    <p class="">Samual Axon at Arts Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/" target="_blank">published an interview</a> with Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) chief John Giannandrea concerning the state of AI at Apple.</p><p class="">If you go back enough years, you can see plenty of articles and hear podcasts where I bemoaned Apple’s ability to compete with AI given the fact that they were not willing, for instance, to throw all of our pictures together so they would have one massive server database for the AI gods. Instead, Apple always said they were going to protect user privacy, and while I agreed with the sentiment, I worried about its long term effects.</p><p class="">However, Apple has been turning my opinion around on this <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/6/privacy-and-big-data" target="_blank">over the past several years</a>. This latest article settles my mind entirely on the question. The point that comes through several times is that Apple believes doing AI analysis on a device actually gives the best user experience because the computing is getting done closer to the user. </p>

<figure class="block-animation-none">
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"
  >
    <span>&#147;</span>Yes, I understand this perception of bigger models in data centers somehow are more accurate, but it’s actually wrong. It’s actually technically wrong. It’s better to run the model close to the data, rather than moving the data around. And whether that’s location data—like what are you doing— [or] exercise data—what’s the accelerometer doing in your phone—it’s just better to be close to the source of the data, and so it’s also privacy preserving.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; John Giannandrea</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="">This is the first time I’ve heard someone from Apple explain how their AI model is better because it is faster, and the privacy benefits are icing on the cake. Privacy has always been at the front of that argument. It’s never been the “also”, until now.</p><p class="">I think the reason Apple is starting to talk more about this is the significant lead they have with Apple silicon.  I’m just not convinced any other company can pull off AI on the device the way Apple is right now. If anyone at Apple were to ask me, I would say push down the gas pedal with on-device AI as hard as you possibly can. </p>

    <p>August tends to be right in the middle of the summer doldrums, the time when everybody goes on vacation and thus news—including tech announcements—are few and far between. Then again, 2020 isn’t your average year, so perhaps it’s not a shock that this week saw a departure from the norm with Apple announcing a surprisingly substantial <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3199629/imacs-release-features-specs-pricing-faq.html">update to the iMac</a>.</p>
<p>My colleague Jason Snell has <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html">already expounded upon what the revamp to Apple’s popular desktop means for the future of that product</a>, but I think it’s worth it to take a moment and see what we can extrapolate from this update and learn about the future of Apple’s <em>other</em> devices. Apple is no stranger to introducing updates in one device that eventually migrate to the rest of its lineup, even from the Mac to the iPhone and iPad and vice versa, and this iMac update is certainly no exception.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3570430/what-the-imac-refresh-can-tell-us-about-apples-future-products.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/08/images-of-concentric-circles/">previous post</a> looked at the images of concentric circles under functions defined by power series. The terms of these series have the form</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>z</em><sup>θ(<em>n</em>)</sup> / θ(<em>n</em>)</p>
<p>where θ(<em>n</em>) is a rapidly increasing function of <em>n</em>. These series are thin (technically, lacunary) because all the terms between values of θ(<em>n</em>) are missing.</p>
<p>The previous post used factorials and powers of 2 as the thinning function. This post uses Fibonacci numbers. It differs from the previous post by using more circles and by making all the circles the same color rather than using matplotlib&#8217;s default colors.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s the plot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_fibonacci2.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>It looks sorta like a tree with ingrown bark.</p>
<p>The code to produce the plot was the same as the code in the previous post with the following changes.</p>
<pre>
    def fib(n):
        phi = (1 + 5**0.5)/2
        return int(phi**n/5**0.5 + 0.5)

    for r in linspace(0, 1, 60):
        z = f(fib, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag, 'b', alpha=0.6)
</pre>
<p>The function <code>fib</code> above uses Binet&#8217;s formula to compute Fibonacci numbers.</p>

    <p>So let’s just get this out of the way: Rogue Amoeba was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">last week’s sponsor</a> here at DF but the sponsorship was for Loopback, for which I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/09/loopback">just posted</a> my end-of-the-week thank-you. But this week they <em>also</em> released a major update to another of their excellent Mac audio utilities, SoundSource, and it’s well worth your attention.</p>

<p>SoundSource is on my short list of Mac utilities that I don’t know what I’d do without. It’s the system-wide audio menu item that ought to be built into MacOS. It gives you instant volume control to every output and input device connected to your Mac, and per-application controls for controlling audio input and output. When I wrote about SoundSource 4 last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/soundsource-4">I noted the interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SoundSource is also a great example of a distinctive, branded UI
that still looks and feels in every way like a standard Mac app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SoundSource 5 is a solid upgrade on functional grounds alone — just the audio features that are its reason for being. But the UI changes and tweaks in version 5 are delightful, and too long to list here. (E.g. the pin icon animation, and the gear menu animation.) The UI is so good that I encourage anyone who appreciates great UI design to download the demo and explore, examine, and think about the interface details of this app even if you have no interest in its features. </p>

<p>It’s both great UI design in the abstract, and a hall-of-fame caliber example of a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps">Mac-assed Mac app</a> in particular.</p>

    <p>My thanks to Rogue Amoeba for sponsoring DF last week to promote Loopback, their amazing Mac audio utility that makes it easy to move audio between applications. Stuck on Zoom calls? Pipe in music and sound effects, or enhance your microphone. Podcasters, merge your mic with other audio sources, then pass it all on to remote guests. Loopback makes seemingly impossible audio routing a breeze.</p>

<p>With virtual audio devices that are usable anywhere on MacOS, Loopback can route audio between software applications and hardware devices alike. The intuitive wire-based interface gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board, all with no cables required. For studio techs, live streamers, and so many others, Loopback is essential.</p>

<p>Download the free trial, then use coupon code <strong>LOOPFIRE</strong> to save $20 when you purchase by August 15. $20 discount, just for DF readers.</p>

    <p>Apple, in its legal filing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers encountering Applicant’s Mark are likely to associate
the mark with Apple. Applicant’s Mark consists of a minimalistic
fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind
Apple’s famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial
impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/misc/2020/08/prepear-apple-comparison.png">Here’s the comparison</a>. I could actually see this being a reasonable objection if Prepear were selling computers or phones or watches. But they’re a recipe app. Their logo clearly looks like a pear, not an apple, and their pear does not even look like an Apple-logo-like pear.</p>

<p>Back in the old days Apple didn’t even pursue legal action against the <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/banana2.html">Banana Junior series of personal computers</a>, and their logo was <a href="/misc/2020/08/banana.jpg">a six-color banana</a>.</p>

    <p>Mark Gurman <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1292147475201941505">tweeted a reminder</a> of this story he reported back in March:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the
internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster
fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new
offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud
streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services
are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5
billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there,
and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5
and Destiny 2.</p>

<p>Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with
the chipmaker’s GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said:
“Ask Apple.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg got the same boilerplate statement from Apple then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">that Business Insider got last week about Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

    <p>Simon Sharwood, writing for The Register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toshiba has finally and formally exited the laptop business.</p>

<p>Toshiba has made laptops since 1985 and claims to have been the
first to make a mass-market computer in the now-familiar clamshell
form factor. By the 1990s the company was producing solid
workhorses in the Satellite range and started to make meaningful
stretches of mobile work possible with the small, thin and light
Portégé range.</p>

<p>Those products saw Toshiba lead the world for laptop market share
through the late 1990s and retain that position for much of the
2000s. Even as the PC market consolidated in that decade, Toshiba
was often ranked among the top five of all PC vendors despite only
ever dabbling in desktops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you go back far enough, Toshiba’s early-era laptops were truly groundbreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Free bestselling ebooks</strong><br />
If you are an Amazon Prime member, you are entitled to two free Kindle ebooks per month from a selection of 9 popular bestselling books chosen by Amazon that month. This same program, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/firstreads?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">First Reads</a>, also gives you access to free short stories and Audible readings for listening, commissioned as Amazon originals. I can usually find at least one book I am interested in each month, and since it is free, why not? —KK</p>
<p><strong>Drive &amp; listen</strong><br />
This cool website, <a href="https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Drive &amp; Listen</a>, pulls dashboard cam videos from YouTube and pairs them up with local music channels so that you can feel like you’re cruising around in a foreign city, blasting the radio, all while sitting at your desk. — CD</p>
<p><strong>Improved Dictanote</strong><br />
I recommended <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/dictanote-pro-lifetime-subscription?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Dictanote</a> a few weeks ago. It’s a Chrome-based application that converts speech to text. It’s faster and less buggy than my Mac’s built-in dictation. Recently, Dictanote released a Google Chrome extension that lets you use Dictanote within almost any website. Now I’m using it to answer emails in Gmail, which has been a big time saver. It doesn’t work with Google Docs, which is unfortunate, but for longer form speech-to-text writing I use Dictanote’s notebook and copy and paste the text (in fact, I’m using the notebook to write this recommendation). It’s $19, and because I’m such a terrible typist, it paid for itself within the first day or two. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the boss radio sound of KHJ 93 Los Angeles</strong><br />
One of my favorite things about Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood </em>was listening to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-once-a-time-hollywood-secured-clip-clearances-create-1969-1274998?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">clips</a> of <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/khj-radio-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#:~:text=The%20film%20is%20an%20homage,pop%20radio%20in%20the%20'60s." target="_blank">93 KHJ</a>, a radio station that pioneered the “boss radio” sound in the 1960s. The DJs were all vocal virtuosos, and the most talented of the bunch was a guy by the name of “The Real Don Steele.” Almost all of these broadcasts have been lost to time, but fortunately, some people recorded KHJ on their tape recorders in the 1960s, and the recordings found their way to the Internet. The Internet Archive has a <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%2293%20KHJ%22&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">couple of recordings</a> from the 1960s of Steele’s show on KHJ.

You can “collect” designs that you like, view code, and see examples of how it looks across different email clients and devices.

<p><strong>Opaque white ink</strong><br />
In my workshop and studio, I label boxes, shelves, drawers, cases, bins, and parts with a very dense white “ink” which is really white correction fluid in a stubby pen. White is usually much more legible than black, but white ink is much more difficult to apply heavy enough to cover any surface. These <a href="https://geni.us/BfQqB?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Pentel Presto Jumbo Correction Pens</a> do a fantastic job applying thick non-drippy white paint via a fine point tip, and are small enough to carry in my workshop apron. They draw perfectly opaque white on any surface, instantly, even vertical surfaces. I have not found anything else that will do that. — KK</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.hakmem.org/">HAKMEM</a> Item 123 gives two plots, both images of concentric circles under functions given by power series with rapidly thinning terms [1]. The first is the function</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_eqn1.svg" alt="f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^{n!}}{n!}" width="109" height="48" /></p>
<p>and the second is</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_eqn2.svg" alt=" g(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^{2^n}}{2^n}" width="110" height="48" /></p>
<p>The lower limits of summation are not given in the original. I assumed at first the sums began at <em>n</em> = 0, but my plots didn&#8217;t match the original until I set the lower index to begin at <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
<p>Here are the plots. First, the image of the circles of radius 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, and 1 under <em>f</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot1.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Next, the images of the circles of radius 1/8, 2/8, …, 8/8 under <em>g</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot2.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Note that the images of concentric circles are smooth, concentric, not self-intersecting for small radii. As the radii get larger, the images of the circles start to intersect. And when the radius is 1, the images are rough and reminiscent of Mandelbrot sets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Python code that produced the plots.</p>
<pre>    from math import factorial
    from numpy import linspace, exp, pi
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def f(thin, z):
        return sum(z**thin(n)/thin(n)
                   for n in range(1, 12))
    
    theta = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000)
    
    for r in [0.5, 0.75, 0.875, 1]:
        z = f(factorial, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag)
    plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
    plt.title("f(z)")
    plt.show()
    plt.close()
    
    for n in range(8):
        r = (n+1)/8
        z = f(lambda n: 2**n, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag)
    plt.title("g(z)")
    plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
    plt.show()
</pre>
<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: Out of curiosity, I unrolled the plots to look at the real and imaginary components separately. Here&#8217;s what I got.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot3.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot4.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Here&#8217;s a plot of the arclength of the image of a circle of radius <em>r</em> under the map <em>g</em>(<em>z</em>).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot5.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>The length of the image curve is nearly proportional to the circumference of the input until <em>r</em> around 0.8, then the length increases quickly. Apparently the arc length goes to infinity as <em>r</em> goes to 1, though I haven&#8217;t proved this.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>A year ago, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/?utm_source=feed">published a piece</a> in the print magazine about that long-standing object of American fascination, the Roman Empire. Usually, and usefully, Americans have over the centuries looked to Rome for guidance on how their nation could avoid the predictable slide from republic to empire to conquest and dissolution. My favorite in this genre is the wonderful 2007 book <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/are-we-rome-cullen-murphy/1111827041"><em>Are We Rome?</em></a>, by my friend (and <em>Atlantic</em> colleague) Cullen Murphy.</p><p>But for last year’s piece I discussed some other books, arguing that what happened to Rome <em>after</em> the fall of the Western empire is what Americans should be studying. Especially in this era when central government—leadership on the imperial scale, you might say—was faltering, and when our counterparts to the Roman provinces (that is, our cities and states and regions) were by comparison so much more practical-minded and functional.</p><p>My friend <a href="http://www.ericschnurer.com/">Eric Schnurer</a>, who has worked in and written extensively (including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/eric-schnurer/?utm_source=feed">for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>) about governance at all levels, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote a response</a> that highlighted some additional areas of useful comparison between the America of our time and the Rome of yesteryear. Now he is back with an extension of his argument. He calls this dispatch “From Sulla to Sullen: What the Fall of the Roman Republic Tells Us About Where Trump Is Taking Us.” I think it is instructive and worth reading, and with his permission I quote it below.</p><p>Schnurer began by directing attention away from the end of the empire, and instead to:</p><blockquote>
<p>… the approaching decline of the Roman Republic, a half-millennium earlier.  As I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote last year</a>, “the increasing economic inequality, the increasing political polarization, the total eclipse of ‘the greater good’ by what we’d call ‘special interests,’ the turn toward political violence” all  looked “a lot like the present moment to me.” I was thinking of the period dominated by the attempted reforms of the Gracchi brothers—a tag-team somewhat analogous to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren —roughly a century before the Republic’s ultimate fall into dictatorship.</p>

<p>I hardly expected then that within about <em>half a year</em>, Donald Trump would manage to fast-forward the country through <em>half a</em> <em>century</em> of Roman history, to the doorstep of the Civil Wars that destroyed what little was left of Republican Rome.</p>

<p>Of course, no historical analogy is exact. The collapse of the Republic was brought on by a combination of structural flaws in its politics and governance, and the self-serving ambitions of ruthless individuals that exploited them. While the causes were many, inter-related, and complex, at their root was a system that defied any notion of the common good and was devoid of political means to resolve rather than exacerbate division.</p>

<p>The Republic was the creation of a tight-knit oligarchy that had overthrown the preceding monarchy and, as a result, held a deep-seated determination never again to allow any one individual to accumulate so much power as to overawe all others.  </p>

<p>The solution was not so much a separation of powers, as we conceive of it—officials simultaneously played executive, legislative and even judicial roles—as a vast multiplicity of individuals who could hold their posts only once, and for only a year. But this was no “citizen’s republic”:  A small coterie of privileged families held almost all these offices and voting was severely limited.</p>

<p>Moreover, the term <em>republic</em>—from the Latin for “a thing of the public”—was meant to distinguish it from a monarchy, which was essentially the personal property of the ruler in which other people simply happened to live. But the Roman Republic was more like what we might think of as a “publicly held corporation” and, essentially, treated as private property. Officials used public office to profit personally and directly (and openly).</p>

<p>Of course, it takes money to make money, so only the very wealthy could afford to pursue these rewards because, along the way, they were expected personally to pay for the lavish spectacles, such as the famous gladiatorial games, that sated the public, as well as major public works and public building projects. The Roman state, in short, while ostensibly “public,” had long since been thoroughly privatized.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This state was essentially an increasingly imperial business enterprise, in the guise of a government. The expanding conquests, which were basically run as profit centers, undercut the working populations in the city through a growing influx of slave labor, and drove rural residents off their land through collapsing agricultural prices due to burgeoning grain imports—the automation and offshoring of their day.</p>

<p>These developments nonetheless personally benefited the wealthy Senatorial and governing elite that wielded government power increasingly for the sole private benefit of its members. This led to spiraling social tensions that, when they flared into violence, were resolved through grudging concessions rather than fundamental—and democratizing—changes.   </p>

<p>The “radical” Warren-esque reforms of the Gracchis, who themselves were highly patrician, arguably aimed to save their own class from themselves as much as saving the Republic, by creating economic safety valves not unlike the patrician Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal at the depths of the Great Depression. The elites were too selfish, or shortsighted, or both, to see the wisdom—resulting in a violent uprising of the dispossessed known as “the Social War.” Conceptions of a greater good shared broadly amongst a frontier people who had thrown off their king, and came together especially in times of external threat, had long since melted away before the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Politics could no longer bridge the divides, because the threat did not come from without: The enemy was the other within.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>In this <em>res public</em> largely eviscerated of any sense of the “public,” politics and government increasingly degenerated further into the personal.  Wealthy politicians vied for, and alternated in power, with the support of their own personal parties, armed factions, and the communications media of the day (Julius Caesar, with his <em>Commentaries</em> on his subjugation of Gaul, was a master of this). By a half-century after the Gracchis’ reforms were beaten back, extremely different visions of governing structure, social issues, and economics eventually confronted each other for power in the form of essentially personalized states built largely around either Gaius Marius or Lucius Cornelius Sulla.</p>

<p>And that might be where we find ourselves today. While the political parallels are far from perfect, Marius, hardly a blameless figure, personified the cause of the <em>populares</em>—what we might think of as more-or-less progressive, advocating for an expanded democracy and economic redistribution. Sulla, a patrician who indulged a fairly libertine, sometimes vulgar, lifestyle even throughout his several marriages, was nonetheless the champion of the economic, social and political conservatives, prevailed and eventually became dictator.</p>

<p>While Roman politics had long been a nasty affair, Sulla was the first to institutionalize “proscription”—the practice of declaring your opponents “enemies of the state” and thereby licensing open-hunting season on them. He also became the first ever to violate perhaps the most deeply held norm of the Republic’s unwritten constitution—that no general was ever to lead armed forces across the sacred boundary, the <em>pomerium</em>, of Rome itself—which set the precedent for Julius Caesar’s later, and more famous, crossing of the Rubicon that all but marked the end of the Republic, and Rome’s imperfect democracy, for good.</p>

<p>Now, within the last month, President Trump has sent armed forces into American cities—but not the regular armed forces, as he has mooted in the past. He didn’t call up the National Guard, as presidents normally do when responding to emergencies or civil unrest: With military leaders and some troops themselves publicly expressing discomfort after their use against peaceful protests in Washington, DC, Trump needed to find forces more personally loyal to himself—and he did so in the Customs and Border Patrol—outside any existing branch of the military, responding directly to his agenda, arguably beyond his constitutional authority, and targeting dissent ...</p>

<p>But, as is often the case with Trump, creation of this new praetorian guard can alternatively be understood as essentially a business, rather than an ideological, development—simply a further, if more disturbing, extension of his privatization and personalization of the federal government. The fact that this new model army displays no government agency’s insignia on its personnel or vehicles—relying instead on widely available camouflage rather than government uniforms—means that private militias and vigilantes can easily join forces with it, or even take actions on their own, indistinguishable from these new-fangled government irregulars. As I <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2017-02-07/donald-trump-and-steve-bannon-will-leave-america-hollow">predicted when Trump first took office</a>, the distinction between public and private sectors is melting away before our very eyes even as to the deployment of legitimate force that, ever since the great sociologist Max Weber, has been seen as the defining element of the state.</p>

<p>Coming as it does at the same time that Trump has declared, even more unmistakably than in the past, that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/20/politics/2020-election-transition-trump/index.html">he is not inclined to honor the election results if he loses</a> and then <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/trump-postpone-election/614755/?utm_source=feed">floated delaying them</a>, the creation of what is essentially his own personal army raises the possibility that Trump eventually may create, well, his own personal government.</p>

<p>Many have expressed concerns for some time that Trump would attempt to remain in office if he were defeated, and might rally armed militias to his cause (I’ve raised this concern myself since the night Trump was elected) … But even if he does leave, the likely Trump post-presidency that fits best with his personality and history—not to mention that of the Romans—may be even more troubling and dangerous.</p>

<p>Trump, if he were to lose, might well leave the White House—he never liked the building to begin with, and doesn’t like the actual work of the presidency—but never concede that he lost. He might not be the real President anymore … but he could play one on TV. If he continued to insist that he were the actual, legitimate President of the United States, there can be little doubt that tens of millions of Americans would believe him. And unlike your average crank, Trump has the resources and ability to turn this into a 24/7 TV reality program through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-allies-explore-buyout-of-conservative-news-channel-one-america-news-network-11578696767">his own television network</a>, even further to the right and more reliably sycophantic than Fox—which he reportedly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/10/17/report-trump-may-start-tv-network/92280290/">was considering launching had he not, unexpectedly, won the 2016 election</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine an alternative President, with at least as much media reach as the one actually in the White House, with an unshakably devoted following of perhaps as much as one-third of the country, and perhaps even his own private armed forces—Sulla with a TV station funded by his fellow reactionary patricians, with his own camo-clad stormtroopers picking up and disappearing <em>populare</em> protestors in unmarked vans—and the present looks even more like the late Republic than when I wrote about this less than a year ago. If this occurs, the country would descend into dueling polities, dueling realities, and dueling war zones.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Of course, there are always alternatives: As dysfunctional as the Republic had become, Rome didn’t necessarily need a Caesar. But it <em>did</em> need a modernization of its pre-imperial governance technology—a standing bureaucracy and a streamlined executive to carry out the legislative will would have improved on the existing multi-headed oligarchy at least as well as the succession of terrible emperors did. And a peaceful mechanism for resolving the increasingly disparate interests of Rome’s increasingly disparate and unwieldy empire—broadened and meaningful democracy, for instance, along with progressive economic policies and perhaps a Plebeian Lives Matter movement—might have averted a half-millennium of dictatorship dominated not by orderly succession but factional assassinations and coups until even the Empire eventually conceded it couldn’t manage the job and simply partitioned itself.</p>

<p>We face similar choices today. History isn’t destiny. But it <em>is</em> a warning.   </p>

    <p>I wound up looking into the etymology of “cherry-pick” while writing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/07/instagram-hashtag-bug">this post</a> earlier today, and I’m simply astounded by this note from Merriam-Webster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first known use of <em>cherry-pick</em> was in 1965.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m shocked that <em>cherry-pick</em> is so recent. I figured it was not just old but maybe <em>really</em> old, centuries old. Is this right?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> The Online Etymology Dictionary <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/cherry-pick">pegs <em>cherry-pick</em>’s origin as 1959</a> — a little earlier, but not much.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Anu Garg, founder and writer of the excellent Wordsmith and its A.Word.A.Day newsletter, <a href="https://wordsmith.org/words/cherry-pick.html">pegged <em>cherry-pick</em>’s earliest documented use as 1966</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> The other OED <a href="https://twitter.com/howe/status/1291910907090448384">has an instance of “cherry-picker” as a railroad industry term for a switchman from 1940</a>, which usage explains why the idiom is about cherries — the switch lights were red.</p>

    <p>A couple of people have asked for an update of a chart I put up <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/06/if-covid-19-cases-are-going-up-why-is-the-death-rate-going-down/">a few weeks ago</a> comparing the COVID-19 case rate with the death rate. Here it is:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857971"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857971" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_case_vs_death_august_7.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="616"></figure>
<p>During the first round of COVID-19, the death rate started to decline about two weeks after the case rate began falling. If the same thing happens this time around, deaths have already peaked and will start to decline in about a week or so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this is what will happen. There have been too many surprises already in the COVID-19 numbers, and the actual death rate will depend a lot on how seriously everyone is taking the recommended countermeasures (masks, social distancing, etc.). I can&#8217;t predict that—and neither can anyone else—which means I can&#8217;t predict the death rate trend either.</p>
<p>Still, if the second round of COVID-19 is like the first round, late July would have been a decent baseline guess for peak deaths—which turned out to be the case—and mid-August is our best guess for the start of the decline.</p>
