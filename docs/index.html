<blockquote cite="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/08/18/laying-the-foundation-for-rusts-future.html"><p>Notwithstanding the deep personal impact, the Rust project as a whole is very resilient to such events. We have leaders and contributors from a diverse set of different backgrounds and employers, and that diversity is a critical strength. Further, it is a common misconception that all of the Mozilla employees who participated in Rust leadership did so as a part of their employment. In fact, many Mozilla employees in Rust leadership <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1294023260770770944">contributed to Rust in their personal time</a>, not as a part of their job.</p>

<p>[The] Rust Core Team and Mozilla are happy to announce plans to create a Rust foundation. The Rust Core Team&rsquo;s goal is to have the first iteration of the foundation up and running by the end of the year.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>While we have only begun the process of setting up the foundation, over the past two years the Infrastructure Team has been leading the charge to reduce the reliance on any single company sponsoring the project, as well as growing the number of companies that support Rust.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, I was surprised to see how many of those things I wrote down don&rsquo;t work anymore.[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And the problem is that all those old APIs are still there in the WWDC videos from last year. But WWDC videos are usually a very good source of knowledge, people come back to them years later looking for information that can&rsquo;t be found in the docs, Apple even often references videos from previous years in new videos, because they naturally can&rsquo;t repeat all information every year.</p>
<p>This was bothering me enough that I decided to spend some time collecting all the major changes in the APIs that were presented in June 2019, but were changed later in one place.</p>

<p>This is an existential threat to indie weather apps. We&rsquo;re now forced to:</p>

B) Create a new set of widgets that are at least as good as Apple&rsquo;s (preferably better!)<br />
C) Do all of this in about 3 months.</p>
<p>We also have to learn all the new tech, update our existing app to work with iOS 14, and deal with the fact that this is all beta software that&rsquo;s clunky, poorly documented, and barely works in a bunch of ways.</p>

<p>I was hoping Apple would integrate the Dark Sky features into the iOS 14 API. That would make it easier to develop (if not necessarily to sell) weather apps, as several of them have better interfaces than Apple&rsquo;s own. Instead, they&rsquo;ve improved the built-in app but made things worse for fans of alternate apps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are former national security officials who served during the
administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush,
George W. Bush, and/or Donald Trump, or as Republican Members of
Congress. We are profoundly concerned about the course of our
nation under the leadership of Donald Trump. Through his actions
and his rhetoric, Trump has demonstrated that he lacks the
character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in
corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as President.</p>

<p>For the following reasons, we have concluded that Donald Trump has
failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be
elected the next President of the United States.</p>

  <p>Among the key findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>That then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort was working with
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/politics/mueller-kilimnik-manafort/index.html">Konstantin Kilimnik</a>, a Russian intelligence officer, and
sought to share internal campaign information with Kilimnik. The
committee says it obtained “some information suggesting Kilimnik
may have been connected” to Russia’s 2016 hacking operation and
concludes Manafort’s role on the campaign “represented a grave
counterintelligence threat.”</p></li>
<li><p>That Trump and senior campaign officials sought to obtain
advance information on WikiLeaks’ email dumps <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks/index.html">through Roger
Stone</a>, and that Trump spoke to Stone about WikiLeaks,
despite telling the special counsel in written answers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/politics/mueller-report-rerelease-fewer-redactions/index.html">he had
“no recollections” that they had spoken about it</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>That information offered at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/politics/trump-tower-meeting-timeline/index.html">the June 2016 Trump Tower
meeting</a> “was part of a broader influence operation” from
the Russian government, though there’s no evidence Trump
campaign members knew of it. Two of the Russians who met with
Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Manafort had “significant
connections” to the Russian government, including Russian
intelligence, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya’s ties
were “far more extensive and concerning than what had been
publicly known.”</p></li>

    <p>David E. Sanger and Julian E. Barnes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/tiktok-security-threat.html">reporting for The New York Times last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok has long presented a parenting problem, as millions of
Americans raising preteens and teenagers distracted by its viral
videos can attest. But when the C.I.A. was asked recently to
assess whether it was also a national security problem, the answer
that came back was highly equivocal.</p>

<p>Yes, the agency’s analysts told the White House, it is possible
that the Chinese intelligence authorities could intercept data or
use the app to bore into smartphones. But there is no evidence
they have done so, despite the calls from President Trump and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to neutralize a threat from the
app’s presence on millions of American devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that TikTok is owned and controlled by a Chinese company is reason enough to be suspicious, and in my opinion <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/18/tiktok-tim-wu">reason enough to ban the service</a>. But there is no evidence to date that TikTok is a security threat in the sense that their app might be doing anything secretly nefarious on our phones. We should be concerned just by what TikTok is doing on the surface, what we see and know TikTok does — its potential as a propaganda arm of the PRC.</p>

<p>In terms of intercepting data it shouldn’t have access to, there’s no sign TikTok has ever done so and there’s no reason to think they <em>could</em> even if they wanted to. All iOS and Google Play Android apps are installed in sandboxes — no app, TikTok or otherwise, has access to data outside its sandbox. <em>Sandbox</em> is arguably a poorly-chosen word from a layperson’s perspective. It’s nothing like a real-world playground where kids can, if unsupervised, freely move from one sandbox to another (or throw sand outside their own sandbox). <a href="https://cocoacasts.com/what-is-application-sandboxing/">An application sandbox is like a virtual world unto itself</a>. They’re implemented technically, not through voluntary compliance. They are technical containers that limit what an app <em>can</em> see and do, not a list of guidelines of what an app <em>should</em> see and do. An app doing something outside its sandbox — without explicit permission from the platform via an entitlement — is exploiting a security vulnerability, not merely breaking the rules.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s possible that TikTok could be exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS and/or Android to access data they shouldn’t be able to, but there’s never been any suggestion that they are. And if they were, it would be huge news, an enormous scandal both for TikTok <em>and</em> the platform vendor (Apple or Google). Why risk it? TikTok is already sitting on a veritable golden goose, collecting information about what sort of videos hundreds of millions of users around the world enjoy watching, and controlling the secret black-box algorithm that determines what new videos those hundreds of millions of people see each time they open TikTok and swipe up. Even if TikTok’s intentions are truly evil, they’d be fools to risk what they have by exploiting security bugs to, say, try to read emails or texts or whatever people are spooked they’re doing.</p>

<p>Being spooked that TikTok is secretly stealing your emails is like being spooked that the ATMs in a casino are stealing your bank account PIN code. Why in the world would a casino run a crooked ATM when you’re using the ATM to take out money to lose to them in slot machines? It’s theoretically possible but makes little sense.</p>

<p>But what about stories like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/biden-campaign-tiktok/index.html">the Biden campaign banning TikTok from staffers’ phones</a>? Or Amazon’s internal IT department sending out a company-wide blast <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200710/p20#a200710p20">declaring that TikTok must be removed from any device that accesses company email</a>, only to issue a “never mind” retraction hours later? People see these stories and assume TikTok must be doing something nefarious. But I very much suspect that the stories themselves are driven by the general hysteria around TikTok being up to no good.</p>

<p>Organizations like the Biden campaign and Amazon’s IT department are banning TikTok not because they know something is fishy about it but as a sort of “cover your ass just in case” thing. Given <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/john-podesta-pizzagate-766489/">what happened to the Clinton campaign’s email</a> in 2016, you can’t blame the Biden campaign for being overly cautious, if not downright paranoid. I recommend paranoia for them. But I think the reason Amazon so quickly <em>reverted</em> its ban on TikTok was because the initial ban was based on nothing more than hearsay.</p>

<p>Consider Apple and Google. Both companies have an inordinate amount of intellectual property to protect. Both companies are surely deeply concerned about the Chinese government, in particular, attempting to infiltrate their systems. Both companies also have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-brand.html">consumer brand reputations</a> to protect with the App Store and Play Store. If either company had any actual reason to suspect TikTok of malfeasance, they’d remove TikTok from their app stores. Surely, the security experts at both companies have examined TikTok with more attention than most apps get.</p>

<p>And even if they couldn’t prove anything, they’d surely be among the very first companies to ban the TikTok app from employee devices if there were any reason to suspect they should. But they haven’t. Apple and Google employees are free to swipe swipe swipe in TikTok to their hearts’ content on the same devices they use for work communication.</p>

<p>We should be concerned about TikTok only because of what we <em>know</em> they have access to: TikTok users’ attention and their interests. There’s no evidence that TikTok has access to anything else on our phones that they shouldn’t.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beginning today, Beats 1, the flagship global radio station, will
be renamed Apple Music 1, and two additional radio stations will
launch: Apple Music Hits, celebrating everyone’s favorite songs
from the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s, and Apple Music Country,
spotlighting country music.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless I’m missing something, “Beats” is now gone from all of Apple Music. What remains of the Beats brand is only the headphone business, which I expect will fade away in the next few years as the AirPods brand expands.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>
      Posted on 20 August 2020 at 4:24&thinsp;pm

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, English has more than five or ten vowel sounds. The actual number is disputed because of disagreements over when two sounds are sufficiently distinct to be classified as separate sounds. I&#8217;ve heard some people say 15, some 17, some over 20.</p>
<p>I ran across a <a href="https://lingthusiasm.com/post/159237203511/lingthusiasm-episode-6-all-the-sounds-in-all-the">podcast episode</a> recently that mentioned a sentence that demonstrates a different English vowel sound in each word:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Who would know naught of art must learn, act, and then take his ease [1].</p>
<p>The hosts noted that to get all the vowels in, you need to read the sentence with non-rhotic pronunciation, i.e. suppressing the r in <em>art</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll run this sentence through some software that returns the phonetic spelling of each word in IPA symbols to see the distinct vowel sounds that way. First I&#8217;ll use Python, then Mathematica</p>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s run this through some Python code that converts English words to <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> notation so we can look at the vowels.</p>
<pre>    import eng_to_ipa as ipa

    text = "Who would know naught of art must learn, act, and then take his ease."
    print(ipa.convert(text))
</pre>
<p>This gives us</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">hu wʊd noʊ nɔt əv ɑrt məst lərn, ækt, ənd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz</p>
<p>Which includes the following vowel symbols:</p>
<ol>
<li>u</li>
<li>ʊ</li>
<li>oʊ</li>
<li>ɔ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ɑ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>æ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ɛ</li>
<li>eɪ</li>
<li>ɪ</li>
<li>i</li>
</ol>
<p>This has some duplicates: 5, 7, 8, and 10 are all schwa symbols.</p>
<p>By default the <code>eng_to_ipa</code> gives one way to write each word in IPA notation. There is an optional argument, <code>retrieve_all</code> that defaults to <code>False</code> but may return more alternatives when set to <code>True</code>. However, in our example the only difference is that the second alternative writes <em>and</em> as <code>ænd</code> rather than <code>ənd</code>.</p>
<p>It looks like the <code>eng_to_ipa</code> module doesn&#8217;t transcribe vowels with sufficient resolution to distinguish some of the sounds in the model sequence. For example, it doesn&#8217;t seem to distinguish the stressed sound <code>ʌ</code> from the unstressed <code>ə</code>.</p>
<h2>Mathematica</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s Mathematica code to split the model sentence into words and show the IPA pronunciation of each word.</p>
<pre>    text = "who would know naught of art must \
        learn, act, and then take his ease" 
    ipa[w_] := WordData[w, "PhoneticForm"]
    Map[ipa, TextWords[text]]
</pre>
<p>This returns</p>
<pre>    {"hˈu", "wˈʊd", "nˈoʊ", "nˈɔt", "ˈʌv", "ˈɒrt", "mˈʌst", 
    "lˈɝn", "ˈækt", "ˈænd", "ðˈɛn", "tˈeɪk", "hˈɪz", "ˈiz"}
</pre>
<p>By the way, I had to write the first word as &#8220;who&#8221; because <code>WordData</code> won&#8217;t do it for me. If you ask for</p>
<pre>    ipa["Who"]</pre>
<p>Mathematica will return</p>
<pre>    Missing["NotAvailable"]</pre>
<p>though it works as expected if you send it &#8220;who&#8221; rather than &#8220;Who.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remove the stress marks and join the words together so we can compare the Python and Mathematica output. The top line is from Python and the bottom is from Mathematica.</p>
<pre>    hu wʊd noʊ nɔt əv ɑrt məst lərn ækt ænd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz
    hu wʊd noʊ nɔt ʌv ɒrt mʌst lɝn  ækt ænd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz
</pre>
<p>There are a few differences, summarized in the table below. Since the symbols are a little difficult to tell apart, I&#8217;ve included their Unicode code points.</p>
<pre>    |-------+------------+-------------|
    | Word  | Python     | Mathematica |
    |-------+------------+-------------|
    | of    | ə (U+0259) | ʌ (U+028C)  |
    | must  | ə (U+0259) | ʌ (U+028C)  |
    | art   | ɑ (U+0251) | ɒ (U+0252)  |
    | learn | ə (U+0259) | ɝ (U+025D)  |
    |-------+------------+-------------|
</pre>
<p>Mathematica makes some distinctions that Python missed, and uses more of the non-rhotic pronounciation that the model sentence is intended to use.</p>

<p>[1] After writing this post I saw the sentence in writing, and the fourth word is &#8220;aught&#8221; rather than &#8220;naught.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t change the vowel since the two words rhyme, but Mathematica doesn&#8217;t recognize the word &#8220;aught.&#8221;</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/20/english-vowel-sounds/" target="_blank">All English vowel sounds in one sentence</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/" target="_blank">John D.

<p>Here’s a tip I learned from Donald Bell’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJZK2etTZFGXYDh8p3x3w?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Maker Update</a>. It’s from an old DigiKey <a href="https://youtu.be/iHyA4M0A8V4?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">“Teaching Moment</a>.” Many barrel jacks have a consistent 5.5mm outside diameter. But the inside diameter can vary, usually either between 2.1mm or 2.5mm. If you don’t have your digital calipers handy, you can determine this inside diameter with common objects: a toothpick, a ball point pen, or a test probe. The brass housing on a ball point pen is usually 2.2mm. If it doesn’t fit inside the barrel of your jack, then the jack is 2.1mm. If the pen easily fits inside, the jack is 2.5mm. A standard toothpick is 2.1mm. If it fits snugly in the jack, it’s a 2.1mm jack. Also, a common multimeter probe needle with fit closely inside of a 2.1mm jack and be very sloppy inside of a 2.5mm jack.</p>

<p>There are at least a dozen ways of removing stripped screws. Many of them involve getting rubber material (say, from a rubber band) between the screw and the bit.

<p><strong>Using the Pomodoro Technique to Fight Distraction</strong><br />
My long-time pal (and <em>Cool Tools</em> and <em>Boing Boing</em> colleague) Mark Frauenfelder has just launched a new newsletter, called <a href="https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0001?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">The Magnet</a>.

<p>In his <a href="https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0001?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">first issue</a>, he talks about the Pomodoro productivity technique. This is a method for trying to focus on the work at hand in our extraordinarily distracted modern world. The basic idea is to set a timer for a set interval of time (say, 25 minutes), come up for air for a set interval (say 10 minutes), set the timer again, rinse, repeat. When under the timer, you do <em>nothing</em> but the work at hand. No checking your phone, email, FaceFart, etc.</p>
<p>I had no idea it had a name, but I’ve used the timer technique for years. Sometimes, it’s the only way I can get anything productive done. I set my timer for 56 minute sessions (don’t ask).</p>
<p>If you have similar distraction issues, consider giving this method a try.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Federal prosecutors in New York on Thursday unsealed criminal charges against Stephen K. Bannon,</strong> President Trump’s former chief strategist, and three other men they alleged defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors using an online crowdfunding campaign that was advertised as raising money to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico&#8230;.<strong>Prosecutors alleged they and two others routed payments from the campaign through the non-profit and another shell company and disguised them with fake invoices to help keep their personal pay secret.</strong> All four were arrested Thursday and are expected to make court appearances later in the day. They are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

    <p class="">I’ve been thinking lately about my journaling workflows. I’m increasingly using digital tools for daily journaling and questioning a lot of assumptions. One of those is about the purpose of journaling my day. Am I doing it to figure out what I was doing at 2:00 p.m. on a given day, or something else? The more I think about it, for me, the answer is something else.</p><p class="">Now I’m looking at my days not in terms of what I was doing at a specific time, but instead what I was doing&nbsp;<em>with my time</em>. I’m usually wearing one of three hats: maker, manager, or consumer.</p><p class=""><strong>The Maker</strong></p><p class="">Whenever I’m adding something, I’m making. I interpret this broadly. Making Field Guides, writing blog posts, doing client work, and making music are examples of things I make. While a lot of the things I make are shared with the world, others aren’t. Whether it’s for others or for me, I’m still making.</p><p class=""><strong>The Manager</strong></p><p class="">For Maker Sparky to produce, Manager Sparky needs to wrangle everything else. This is both an essential support role and an easy trap to fall into.</p><p class=""><strong>The Consumer</strong></p><p class="">When I’m not making or managing, I’m consuming. This ranges from watching <em>Star Wars</em> to reading scholarly articles. It’s all-consuming. This isn’t bad. It’s one of the best ways I come up with ideas for Maker Sparky.</p><p class="">My purpose in journaling is tracking how I’m spending my time in these roles. I don’t view any of them as inherently good or bad. The magic is in the balance. While making is most important to me, both managing and consuming enable making. I want to spend more time making than consuming. I need to spend time managing, but not go down the management/productivity rabbit hole so far that I don’t make anything.</p><p class="">So with this in mind, I’ve been focusing my journaling lately not so much on what I had for lunch, but what I make, manage, and consume. Using tags, I can then see it on a daily, weekly, and even monthly basis. If I look at my week and realize I spent most of my time sharpening pencils and sorting tasks (manager) and not enough time producing content (maker), I know I need to make changes. You can get similar information by tracking your time, but I think there is something more concrete looking at a list of things you’ve made, managed, and consumed over a period of time.</p><p class="">Implementing this isn’t difficult. You could create a text file and start making a list. You can do the same thing with a pad of paper and a pencil, or, if you’re using a digital journal like Day One, add tags for #maker, #manager, and #consumer. The real benefit of this comes in planning and review. If you’re going to track yourself as a maker, manager, and consumer, you should have some expectations and a feedback mechanism for living up to them.</p>

    <p>OK, then. Today the president of the United States called for a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1296092859226042368">boycott</a> of Goodyear tires; <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/08/facebook-just-cracked-down-on-qanon-hours-later-trump-promoted-it/">praised the QAnon conspiracy theory nuts;</a> congratulated a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/19/trumps-republican-party-now-has-ballot-full-nutters/">Republican nominee for Congress</a> who makes the QAnon folks look levelheaded; and once again lied about Barack Obama <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1296274065762717696">spying on his campaign.</a> Just another day at the office.</p>
<p>All things considered, then, I&#8217;d say that Obama&#8217;s convention speech about Trump <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/08/barack-obama-2020-dnc-speech/">was positively measured:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For close to four years now, he’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. <strong>170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.</strong></p>

<p>Note that with an Apple Silicon Mac, unsigned software won&rsquo;t run at all. You can sign it without needing a developer account, but you can&rsquo;t notarize it, so it will be treated to these dialogs.</p>

<p>New in macOS 11 on Apple silicon Mac computers, and starting in the next macOS Big Sur 11 beta, the operating system will enforce that any executable must be signed with a valid signature before it&rsquo;s allowed to run. There isn&rsquo;t a specific identity requirement for this signature: a simple ad-hoc signature issued locally is sufficient, which includes signatures which are now generated automatically by the linker. This new behavior doesn&rsquo;t change the long-established policy that our users and developers can run arbitrary code on their Macs, and is designed to simplify the execution policies on Apple silicon Mac computers and enable the system to better detect code modifications.</p>
<p>This new policy doesn&rsquo;t apply to translated x86 binaries running under Rosetta, nor does it apply to macOS 11 running on Intel platforms.</p>

It’s a free Mac utility that lets you put more or less anything you want in your menu bar. I keep finding more uses for it—at this point I’ve got four separate BitBar items in my menu bar.</p>
<p>At its simplest, BitBar is an app that runs plug-ins that display information in your menu bar. (It’s named because it was initially built to display Bitcoin prices.) There’s a whole collection of plug-ins at <a href="http://getbitbar.com">getbitbar.com</a>, so if you’re not comfortable writing your own, you might find exactly what you want. It’s also easy to modify existing plugins to do what you want—all a BitBar plugin is, is a script that runs, gets data, and then returns a value that is displayed in the menu bar.</p>
<p>Last week a friend of mine upgraded to Catalina and, in the process, lost an old Mac utility he used to display the currently playing track in iTunes/Apple Music. I suggested he look at BitBar, which has a <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Music/music.10s.sh">plugin that does just that</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that while it worked, BitBar’s plugin didn’t do exactly what he wanted. Most notably, he wanted the current track to be displayed in the format <code>Song Title - Album (Year) - Artist</code>. Since this particular plugin was a shell script, I was able to open it in BBEdit and quickly <a href="https://pastebin.com/UfBX9H4k">customize it</a> to meet his needs.</p>
<p>For example, the existing music plug-in didn’t display the year, but I was able to include a little bit of inline AppleScript within the shell script that did the trick:</p>
<pre><code>year=$(osascript -e'
set theYear to "0"
tell application "Music"
    try
        set theYear to (year of current track as string)
    on error errText
        ""
    end try
end tell
if theYear = "0" then
    return ""
else
    return ("(" &amp; theYear &amp; ")")
end if
');
</code></pre>
<p>I also ripped out a bunch of features that my friend didn’t really want, like play/pause/next/previous controls and a bunch of metadata in the dropdown menu. (Yes, BitBar will let you not just create custom text in the menu bar, but in the items that display when you click on the menu bar item.)</p>
<p>Last week Dan Moren updated a plug-in that I wrote a while back that looks at the live-stream servers of our various podcast networks and displays the current number of listeners in the menu bar. (He re-wrote the thing in PHP, since that’s a language he’s comfortable with.)</p>
<p>I’ve also got the current temperature from my weather station in my menu bar thanks to BitBar. Since I was more comfortable writing in AppleScript than in a shell script, my weather “plugin” is a single line – <code>osascript ~/weatherscript.scpt</code> – that runs a small AppleScript script that queries my weather station and returns the current temperature data, which BitBar displays.</p>
<p>Finally, I use a tiny plugin that pings my Linode server and reports back the total ping time, which is useful in determining at a glance if I’m really having network issues or if it’s just my imagination.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable in literally any scripting language that can execute on your Mac, you can build BitBar plugins to display anything you can think of in your menu bar.</p>

    <p>If you go by surveys, something like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">60 percent</a> of Americans say they wear masks whenever they leave the house. But do they really? The <em>LA Times</em> decided to count actual mask use, and the results weren&#8217;t pretty. In upscale Venice mask usage was fairly good, but down here in Orange County <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-covid-19-masks-who-is-following-the-rules/#nt=00000173-4a29-dafc-a977-dabb7b330001-liA3promoMedium-1col-7030col1-main">things were pretty dismal:</a></p>

<p><strong>Betsy Delph</strong> is a classically trained chef who manages the kitchen for an outdoor science school, has spent six years as a wilderness fire lookout for the US Forest Service, and is a <a href="https://www.alidadeforesttherapy.com/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">forest therapy/shinrin yoku guide</a>. She loves carrying this super-portable watercolor setup into the mountains, woods, or backyard. You can find Betsy on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/betsystarshine/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">@betsystarshine</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About the bag</strong></p>
<p>The bag is a <a href="https://geni.us/pJRt?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Rite in the Rain Side-Bound Notebook Cover</strong></a>. It fits a plethora of things and it’s only 5.5&#8243; x 8.5&#8243;. It’s made of Cordura, so it’s super-tough and has just enough structure to protect my brushes, palettes, and paper from the inside of my backpack.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s inside the bag</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://art-toolkit.com/products/palettes/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>The Pocket Palettes by Art Toolkit</strong></a> are simply phenomenal. They’re compact, with a mixing palette, and various sizes of magnetic pans so you can create your own custom selection of color. They also make pre-filled palettes to give you a jump start.</p>
<p>I filled my pans with <a href="http://danielsmith.com/daniel-smith-essentials-watercolor-5ml-set-6-colors/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Daniel Smith Watercolors</strong></a>. They have more than 250 colors, which is enough to bend your brain. I started with their Essentials Set and picked up one of their Dot Cards so I could test-drive some of the colors my favorite artists use before picking some more to buy…I’m up to 34 colors now.</p>
<p>I started off with travel brushes that have a little water well in the handle, but I didn’t like how I couldn’t control the flow very well, and pretty much used them like normal brushes. So I upgraded to still <a href="https://geni.us/N8R1L6e?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>very affordable synthetic sable travel brushes</strong></a>. My prize one is real sable, from <a href="https://www.rosemaryandco.com/watercolour-brushes?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Rosemary &amp; Co</a>, but the set from Amazon is great and 3 brushes cost as much as the single nicer one.</p>
<p>I like to use <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/products/fluid-100-watercolor-paper-blocks/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>watercolor blocks of various sizes</strong></a>. The pages are glued together in a “block”, which means the paper stays flat without having to tape it down. Fluid Watercolor Blocks are a good value and quality, and come in a wide array of sizes. One of the 4&#8243; x 6&#8243; blocks fits right in the bag, or I’ll carry a bigger one along with it.</p>

    <p class="">I was recently reading&nbsp;<a href="https://benjaminhardy.com/10-reasons-you-should-wake-up-at-5am-for-30-days-straight/" target="_blank"><span>Benjamin Hardy’s article</span></a>&nbsp;about waking up early. He makes many good points, but I can’t help think he is missing a huge caveat. While waking up early&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;help you, not getting enough sleep&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;wreck you.<br><br>Not getting enough sleep&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body" target="_blank"><span>messes with your body in so many ways</span></a>. Memory issues, trouble concentrating, mood changes, weight gain, and balance issues are just the start of the list. Not getting enough sleep also lowers your libido. We’re talking less sex, people! Seriously, a doctor friend once explained it to me simply: “Not getting enough sleep is like operating the human body while intoxicated.”<br><br>I’m all for playing with your schedule. If you need to get up at 3:00 a.m. to be the best you, then absolutely do it. But if you think you can do that without getting enough sleep, you’re kidding yourself.</p>

The <a href="https://geni.us/dura-scoop">DuraScoop</a> is made from cast aluminum and will never bend. It easily shaves hardened clumps of litter from that litter box that would cause a plastic scoop to fold in half. It&#8217;s actually a beautiful looking tool, too. If Raymond Loewy designed a scoop, it would look like this (maybe the handle wouldn&#8217;t be covered with textured plastic). Cleaning cat litter is an unpleasant daily chore for me, but the DuraScoop makes it much less unpleasant.</p>

    <p>For the past few decades all the old guard political reporters have bemoaned the fact that political conventions serve no real purpose anymore and are basically just prime time ads for the political parties. Well guess what? COVID-19 has finally turned them literally into party advertisements: just a bunch of prerecorded segments edited together into a 2-hour infomercial.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s great! The pace is livelier than live conventions; more people get to speak since their segments can be more tightly controlled; and in an era of media sophistication I&#8217;ll bet viewers like it better. They know perfectly well how it&#8217;s being put together and they don&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a semi-prediction: Four years from now conventions might remain virtual. It&#8217;s a helluva lot cheaper for the parties. It makes for a better show. And the candidates have tighter control over the whole thing. The only thing missing is the buckraking parties that can only take place in person, but maybe modern fundraising techniques make those unnecessary anyway. Check back in four years to see if I&#8217;m right.</p>

    <p>David Shayer, in a rather incredible story for TidBITS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing
code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of
iPod Software — my boss’s boss — abruptly entered and closed the
door behind him. He cut to the chase. “I have a special assignment
for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two
engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod.
Report only to me.”</p>

<p>The next day, the receptionist called to tell me that two men were
waiting in the lobby. I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew,
the engineers who would actually build this custom iPod. I’d love
to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats and were glancing
in window reflections to make sure they hadn’t been tailed, but
they were perfectly normal thirty-something engineers. I signed
them in, and we went to a conference room to talk.</p>

<p>They didn’t actually work for the Department of Energy; they
worked for a division of Bechtel, a large US defense contractor to
the Department of Energy. They wanted to add some custom hardware
to an iPod and record data from this custom hardware to the iPod’s
disk in a way that couldn’t be easily detected. But it still had
to look and work like a normal iPod.</p>

<p>They’d do all the work. My job was to provide any help they needed
from Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a wild story. <a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1295727727606104064">Tony Fadell, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project was real w/o a doubt.</p>

<p>There was whole surreal drama and interesting story about how this
project was kicked off and then kept secret.</p>

    <p>Tim Wu, writing at The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In China, the foreign equivalents of TikTok and WeChat — video
and messaging apps such as YouTube and WhatsApp — have been
banned for years. The country’s extensive blocking,
<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/03/censored-contagion-how-information-on-the-coronavirus-is-managed-on-chinese-social-media/">censorship</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/05/we-chat-they-watch/">surveillance</a> violate just about <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2019">every
principle</a> of internet openness and decency. China keeps a
closed and censorial internet economy at home while its products
enjoy full access to open markets abroad.</p>

<p>The asymmetry is unfair and ought no longer be tolerated. The
privilege of full internet access — the open internet — should
be extended only to companies from countries that respect that
openness themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Wu addresses the fact that Trump is almost certainly wrong in his reasons for opposing TikTok, but even then he’s ultimately right in the “even a stopped clock is right twice a day” sense. We — not just the United States but the entire free world — are being played as suckers by China. You’re either part of the open internet or you’re not — and China wants no part of the open internet.</p>

<p>The idea that being exposed to the internet would inevitably help open China was a reasonable and well-intentioned theory, but it was obviously wrong. Allowing China to export its own internet services while it blocks <em>all</em> of the services from the rest of the world is both dangerous and dumb. They’re using the internet to export authoritarianism, not to import democracy and liberalism.</p>

    <p>Nicole Nguyen, in her new column at The Wall Street Journal (where she moved from BuzzFeed News) (<a href="https://apple.news/ARhZrxwH7TLyPBu4fePRrmw">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once a simple photo-sharing app, Instagram now offers ephemeral
social media, short-form video, long-form video, video chat,
private messaging, inspiration bookmarking and shopping. I started
spending most of my time on Instagram instead of Facebook because
Facebook was too bloated. Now it feels like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-is-turning-into-facebook-and-thats-bad-1517422670">Instagram <em>is</em>
Facebook</a>. […]</p>

<p>Still, it will likely take more than a library of hit songs and
video-editing tools for Instagram to re-create TikTok’s success.
On TikTok, you don’t need an account to become addicted. It’s pure
entertainment, like TV, without the terrible fear-of-missing-out
feeling you get by looking at posts from friends and family.</p>

<p>But unlike TV, a finely tuned algorithm figures out what you see
next. And that algorithm is freakishly good. You scroll and scroll
until you’re physically exhausted and can’t scroll any longer.</p>

<p>Instagram’s recommendations aren’t quite there yet. I watched a
haphazard mix of imported TikToks, manic 15-second cooking videos
and clips of celebrities … being celebrities. There’s little of
the eclectic weird magic found on TikTok’s main feed, its
personalized “For You” page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It feels odd talking about “the good old days” of Instagram, but well, I enjoyed Instagram a <em>lot</em> more when it was focused simply and exquisitely on photo sharing. Obviously I don’t speak for the greater world — Instagram got a lot more popular as I deemed it to be getting worse.</p>

<p>But there has to be a limit to how much Facebook can cram into Instagram before it bursts at the seams, and Reels feels like too much. TikTok just doesn’t feel Instagrammy <em>at all</em>, so I don’t think the problem with Reels is execution, I think it’s just the basic idea of using Instagram to host Facebook’s TikTok clone. It’s a bad fit, and Facebook doesn’t have the taste to know it. Facebook is like a society in a sci-fi novel that polluted and ruined its home world (Facebook), colonized a beautiful new world (Instagram), and just went ahead and immediately polluted and ruined the new world in the exact same way.</p>

<p>(Call it a hunch, or maybe just wishful thinking, but I think someone could have a nice hit with a great clone of the old original photo-sharing Instagram. Not a goliath titan of the tech industry hit, just a nice profitable hit. Like making a nice successful restaurant, never intended to be a nationwide chain with 1,000 locations.)</p>

    <p>Don Giller is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/fashion/mens-style/david-letterman-late-show-don-giller.html">unofficial archivist</a> of David Letterman’s talk show career. It’s a crying shame that a curated sample of Letterman’s output from his NBC and CBS shows isn’t on a streaming service somewhere, but all of it is in Don Giller’s archive and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWmcFDWz7evOe0Zbly3l8Q">some of it is on his YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>His latest video compilation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBSOuVS_u4&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Faces Project Part 1</a>, begins with some dialogue between Letterman and bandleader Paul Shaffer in late 1989 as they were preparing for their eighth anniversary special (which I attended!): “We’re looking at stuff that we did, you and I, eight years ago. Boy do we look dorky…. My fear is that eight years from now we’ll look at tapes from tonight and I’ll be saying the same thing.”</p>
<p>What follows is Letterman’s face from every episode of the show on NBC, 1,810 shows aired between 1982 until 1993. <a href="https://donzblog.home.blog/2020/08/18/the-making-of-the-faces-project/">Don explains how he did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Searching and selecting appropriate screen-captures took a full month. “Tedious” doesn’t begin to describe the slog…. I used iMovie 9 for its relative simplicity. Instead of importing every image into one iMovie file, which would have slowed the processing down considerably, I instead chose the modular approach, creating one file per show year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an amazing project and over 13 minutes you can watch Letterman age 11 years.</p>

    <p>One of the secrets to being an efficient computer power user is mastering the use of keyboard shortcuts. When you can tap a couple of keys and kick off something that otherwise would’ve required you to take your hands off the keyboard, move to your pointing device, push the pointer around on the screen, and click to get to a command, your efficiency blooms.</p>
<p>There are a lot of utilities out there that will let you attach almost any command you can imagine to a keyboard shortcut, and I use some of them. But for the purposes of this column, I wanted to praise the one that Apple provides with macOS itself: the Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard pane in the System Preferences app. It’s always my first stop when I’m trying to see if I can add a keyboard shortcut to my workflow.</p>
<p>The Shortcuts pane is subdivided, with nine categories on the left and the contents of the selected categories on the right. Many of Apple’s default system shortcuts are here, and you can turn them off by unchecking the box on the left of the list—which is very handy if you keep typing a shortcut by mistake.</p>

    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/its-time-for-apple-to-change-the-app-store-sales-model-f9ff09dd314f">Drew McCormack</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/drewmccormack/status/1294956724173049857">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/its-time-for-apple-to-change-the-app-store-sales-model-f9ff09dd314f"><p>But that is not the app world of 2020. It has become a huge, multifaceted market, with multiple platforms, crossover with the web, and a multitude ways to make money. Very few companies now live solely within Apple&rsquo;s city walls; they are more like multinationals, with offices in many cities, trading across borders in a global marketplace. Apple&rsquo;s simplistic feudal system, taxing income alone, feels dated.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[The] landlord&rsquo;s success is based on bringing value to the property itself, and my success derives from how well I execute on my business, the restaurant. It would feel wrong if the landlord demanded a cut of the restaurant profits, something they have had no part in.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To make it in today&rsquo;s app world, you have to find your own users. A company like Netflix will have benefited very little from being featured by Apple, and that is no doubt why they feel miffed at Apple taking 30% of income they have worked hard for.</p></blockquote>

<p>He wants a rent-like fee based on download tiers, plus a (smaller) percentage for apps that use Apple&rsquo;s payment processing.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1295031241746649089">Max Seelemann</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1295031241746649089"><p>We&rsquo;d be a step closer to fairness if apps that monetize outside would also pay for the visibility and distribution. Especially business apps and ad-driven platforms pay nothing but get all the benefits for free.</p>
<p>Developers don&rsquo;t owe Apple for the iPhone or the toolchain. That&rsquo;s nuts. Apple earns for that from the devices sales. Building an SDK is a service for the users not the developers. They sell more phones because of apps available and their quality.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/"><p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple&rsquo;s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn&rsquo;t support traditional trials or upgrades, the importance of which I&rsquo;ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/depth42/status/1295640388779347968">Frank Illenberger</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/depth42/status/1295640388779347968">
<p>I would be more than happy to pay 30% for sales through the Apple App Stores if they were first class for both customers and developers. But until we get there they have to fix a lot of problems[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The StoreKit framework is deficient. Implementing subscriptions is extremely tedious and unreliable and the customer facing purchase UI only consists of raw modal alerts loosely popping up in any order.</p>
<p>Why are subscription apps and apps with free trials treated as if they were free? This is deeply wrong, confusing, and is leading to a load of problems like unwarranted bad reviews and unfair placement in the charts.</p>
<p>Apple does not offer a path for paid upgrades but at the same time limits the types of apps that are eligible for subscriptions. This severely restricts business opportunities for a lot of apps.</p>

@tim_cook in 2015 was part of the congressional record in the antitrust hearings earlier this month. My email was about App Review gaining too much power (back in 2015!)</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple removed our popular iOS app which at the time was visited by 750k devices each day. Our app was an app recommendation app that curated the App Store into lists of best apps to download. In late 2014 it was removed from the App Store without warning.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>The reason they listed was not their true motivations.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190694">Mahmoud Hafez</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24189341">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190694"><p>I subsequently spoke to Phillip Shoemaker, who confirmed that Apple executives ordered the elimination of apps that drove downloads to the App Store. He said &ldquo;Your app drove download volume. Apple doesn&rsquo;t want any outside sources to drive ratings. So yeah, we got rid of all app recommendation apps.&rdquo; He said he thought it was unfair, but this was something Apple set out to do, and even as Senior Director of App Store (person directly in charge of App Review), he could not stop it.</p>
<p>The other thing that was hard to understand, is we used to have a great relationship with Apple. We were not flying under the radar. Since the App Store first launched in 2008, we used to be invited to all Apple events to see the new product launches, we met with the iTunes team to discuss upcoming initiates for the App Store, our apps were featured on the devices inside of many demo units into Apple Stores. It felt like a complete 180, and until this day I never got a formal conversation on what they actually objected to, beyond being pointed to a vague rule which was applied arbitrarily. They became a brick wall in terms of communication, and this is why I resorted to emailing Tim Cook. </p></blockquote>

<p>How can this be, when Tim Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/28/tim-cook-antitrust-opening-statement-app-store/">told Congress</a> that the rules are &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; and Apple wants to &ldquo;get every app we can on the store, not keep them off&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/015127.pdf">letter</a> (PDF):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/015127.pdf"><p>When we saw some apps get removed, it made us more steadfast in our mission. Because we believed the fact that we were not bothered is because we were doing it the "right1 way. We were really serving the user and the App Store. Not selling fake "recommendations" as deceptive ads. We literally turned down millions of dollars in revenues, as developers repeatedly asked to pay per install to be featured in our app (outside of tradition advertising).</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I always thought I knew what these guidelines were trying to protect. People gaming the App Store charts and users being tricked into believing bad apps were the best. But we are not doing that. I can&rsquo;t even make up a reason why I think Apple would not want our app on the Store. It&rsquo;s a great app with [redacted] 5 star reviews and countless thank you emails from our users.</p>
<p>I fear App Review is getting too powerful. It&rsquo;s no longer about keeping iDevices safe or protecting the user&rsquo;s best interest. It&rsquo;s now about something else which I don&rsquo;t understand. I am not alone in this observation and it honestly makes developing on the platform scary.</p></blockquote>

    <p>On September 18, from 2-8 PM Eastern, Myke Hurley and I will be hosting the second annual Podcastathon for St. Jude, raising money for an amazing institution that treats children without their families ability to pay.</p>
<p>That work begins today. We&#8217;d love to have you join us in raising $315,000 for St. Jude. The Relay FM community really rallied around this last year, and I think 2020&#8217;s campaign will be even better.</p>

<p id="p2">Today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/apple-announces-apple-music-radio/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> an expansion and rebranding for Apple Music&rsquo;s radio efforts. The flagship worldwide radio station Beats 1 is being renamed Apple Music 1 while retaining the same content as before.</p>
<p id="p3">Joining Apple Music 1 in Apple&rsquo;s lineup of global radio stations will be two new stations: Apple Music Hits and Apple Music Country. The former is dedicated to well-known and well-loved songs from the &lsquo;80s, &lsquo;90s, and 2000s, while the latter highlights modern and classic country music.</p>
<p id="p4">Like Apple Music 1&rsquo;s roster of hosts and presenters, which includes Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Brooke Reese, Apple&rsquo;s two new stations will have daily on-air hosts as well. For Apple Music Hits this includes Jayde Donovan, Estelle, Lowkey, and more; Apple Music Country will be hosted by Kelleigh Bannen, Ty Bentli, and Bree, among others.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/24a9781d-41fc-42bd-8c2f-01dbb39885be.jpeg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p6">One of the unique strengths of Apple Music 1, besides its strong team of hosts, is the periodic shows by artists such as Billie Eilish, Elton John, and Frank Ocean. Apple has assembled just as impressive an assortment of shows for its new stations. Per Apple&rsquo;s press release, Apple Music Hits will feature exclusive shows from &ldquo;Backstreet Boys, Ciara, Mark Hoppus, Huey Lewis, Alanis Morissette, Snoop Dogg, Meghan Trainor, Shania Twain, and more.&rdquo; For Apple Music Country the list of shows is even longer, featuring:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  Jimmie Allen, Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, BRELAND, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs, Morgan Evans, Florida Georgia Line, Pat Green, Willie Jones, Chrissy Metz, Midland, Rissi Palmer, The Shires, Carrie Underwood, and Morgan Wallen, alongside exclusive shows from legendary producers and songwriters like Dave Cobb, Jesse Frasure, and Luke Laird, and journalist Hunter Kelly.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">Apple Music hasn&rsquo;t changed its radio product much over the years, so today&rsquo;s announcements represent a significant move for the company. While I still wish the Music app provided better tools for informing me when a new radio show I may be interested in is coming up, such as push notifications as a show&rsquo;s starting, perhaps today&rsquo;s moves are just the beginning. Now that the content side of radio has been enhanced, perhaps this fall&rsquo;s updated Music app will offer improvements to the software side of the radio experience.</p>

    <p>One of the great things about not being—or having aspirations of being—a professional Apple blogger is that there’s no compulsion to write about every Apple story that pops up. I was reminded of this a few days ago when the Apple/Epic war broke out. As my RSS reader filled with links and summaries and hot takes, a wave of relief washed over me. It was like seeing that my grades on the midterms and homework were good enough that I didn’t have to take the final exam.</p>
<p>Mind you, it’s not that I have no opinions. My chief opinion is that I should update my <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/11/simpler-syndication/">homemade feedreading system</a> to give me a faster way to delete tedious entries.</p>

    <p>The floor of <em>y</em> is the greatest integer less than or equal to <em>y</em> and is denoted ⌊<em>y</em>⌋.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ceiling of <em>y</em> is the smallest integer greater than or equal to <em>y</em> and is denoted ⌈<em>y</em>⌉.</p>
<p>Both of these notations were introduced by Kenneth Iverson. Before Iverson&#8217;s notation caught on, you might see [<em>x</em>] for the floor of <em>x</em>, and I don&#8217;t know whether there was a notation for ceiling. </p>
<p>There was also a lack of standardization over whether [<em>x</em>] meant to round <em>x</em> down or round it to the nearest integer. Iverson&#8217;s notation caught on because it&#8217;s both mnemonic and symmetrical.</p>
<p>Iverson also invented the notation of using a Boolean expression inside square brackets to indicate the function that is 1 when the argument is true and 0 when it is false. I find this notation very convenient. I&#8217;ve used it on projects for two different clients recently.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an equation from <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4AnOl">Concrete Mathematics</a> using all three Iverson notations discussed here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">⌈<em>x</em>⌉ &#8211; ⌊<em>x</em>⌋ = [<em>x</em> is not an integer].</p>
<p>In words, the ceiling of <em>x</em> minus the floor of <em>x</em> is 1 when <em>x</em> is not an integer and 0 when <em>x</em> is an integer.</p>

    <p>Emacs has a relatively convenient way to add accents to letters or to insert a Unicode character if you know the code point for the value. See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/emacs_unicode/">these notes</a>.</p>
<p>But usually you don&#8217;t know the Unicode values of symbols. Then what do you do?</p>
<h2>TeX commands</h2>
<p>You enter symbols by typing their corresponding TeX commands by using</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET tex</pre>
<p>After doing that, you could, for example, enter π by typing <code>\pi</code>.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see the backslash as you type the command, but once you finish you&#8217;ll see the symbol instead [1].</p>
<h2>HTML entities</h2>
<p>You may know the HTML entity for a symbol and want to use that to enter characters in Emacs. Unfortunately, the following does NOT work.</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET html</pre>
<p>However, there is a slight variation on this that DOES work:</p>
<pre>    M-x set-input-method RET sgml</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve set your input method to sgml, you could, for example, type <code>&amp;radic;</code> to insert a √ symbol.</p>
<p>Why SGML rather than HTML?</p>
<p>HTML was created by simplifying SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). Emacs is older than HTML, and so maybe Emacs supported SGML before HTML was written.</p>
<p>There may be some useful SGML entities that are not in HTML, though I don&#8217;t know. I imagine these days hardly anyone knows anything about SGML beyond the subset that lives on in HTML and XML.</p>
<h2>Changing input modes</h2>
<p>If you want to move between your default input mode and TeX mode, you can use the command <code>toggle-input-method</code>. This is usually mapped to <code>C-u C-\</code>. </p>
<p>You can see a list of all available input methods with <code>list-input-methods</code>. Most of these are spoken languages, such as Arabic or Welsh, rather than technical input modes like TeX and SGML. </p>
<h2>More Emacs posts</h2>
<ul>
<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/emacs_unicode/">Notes on Unicode in Emacs</a></li>
<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/regex-perl-python-emacs/">Regex in Python, Perl, and Emacs</a></li>

</ul>
<p>[1] I suppose there could be a problem if one command were a prefix of another. That is, if there were symbols <code>\foo</code> and <code>\foobar</code> and you intended to insert the latter, Emacs might think you&#8217;re done after you&#8217;ve typed the former. But I can&#8217;t think of a case where that would happen. TeX commands are nearly <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/09/03/prefix-codes/">prefix codes</a>. There are TeX commands like <code>\tan</code> and <code>\tanh</code>, but these don&#8217;t represent symbols per se. Emacs doesn&#8217;t need any help to insert the letters &#8220;tan&#8221; or &#8220;tanh&#8221; into a file.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/18/emacs-symbols/" target="_blank">Entering symbols in Emacs</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/" target="_blank">John D.

    </p></div>
    <p>Epic’s announcement that Apple is threatening to terminate their membership in the Apple Developer Program prompted me to look at the current terms of the developer program license agreement. The terms are pretty clear that Apple <em>can</em> do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><bold>11.2 Termination</bold></p>

<p>This Agreement and all rights and licenses granted by Apple
hereunder and any services provided hereunder will terminate,
effective immediately upon notice from Apple: […]</p>

<p>(f) if You engage, or encourage others to engage, in any
    misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act
    relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
    misrepresenting the nature of Your submitted Application
    (e.g., hiding or trying to hide functionality from Apple’s
    review, falsifying consumer reviews for Your Application,
    engaging in payment fraud, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a court of law, Apple seems well within its rights to terminate Epic’s membership. In the court of public opinion, Apple comes off looking heavy-handed here, especially as it pertains to Unreal Engine. To be clear, Apple is not banning or even mentioning games that use Unreal Engine; what Epic is saying is that all games that use Unreal Engine will be affected as a byproduct of Epic no longer being able to work on Unreal Engine for Apple’s platforms. It’s further escalation on both sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Epic: <em>Surprise! We snuck our own payment processing into a Fortnite update.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>Fortnite is no longer listed in the App Store and we’re not going to approve updates until Fortnite complies with our rules.</em></li>
<li>Epic: <em>We’re suing and releasing a video to all our users that paints Apple as an oppressive monopolist bully.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>We’re revoking Epic’s developer program membership.</em> (Would Apple have done this even without Epic having filed a lawsuit? Not clear.)</li>
<li>Epic: <em>Without a membership we’ll be forced to cease development of Unreal Engine for iOS and MacOS.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(Honestly, the most shocking thing about the Apple Developer Program License Agreement is that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/services-account/agreement/XV2A27GUJ6/content/pdf">the PDF</a> is entirely typeset in Arial. Clearly it should be San Francisco, but Helvetica would be acceptable. Arial should be a firing offense.)</p>

        • by John Gruber
      
      
       • <span class="permalink"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/18/apple-statement">∞</a></span>
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users
and a great business opportunity for all developers. Epic has been
one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing
into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS
customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company
as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the
Store. The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can
easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that
reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which
apply to all developers. We won’t make an exception for Epic
because we don’t think it’s right to put their business interests
ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a good statement. Epic has been clear that they aren’t seeking a permanent exception to the App Store Guidelines, or a special deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/amazon_apple_prime_video">like Amazon’s for Prime Video</a> (which Apple wasn’t going to offer them anyway — games are different). They want to see Apple (and Google) change their platforms. So the “exception” Apple speaks of, I think, would be allowing Fortnite to remain in the App Store with its own payment processing while the lawsuit is litigated — and perhaps allowing Epic to keep its developer program membership?</p>

<p>So who blinks first? I think Epic will blink, submit a Fortnite update that reverts to compliance with the App Store guidelines, and try to save face by saying, “<em>Look at what Apple forced us to do — we had to raise V-Bucks prices</em>”. But they’ll keep their lawsuit going. The lawsuit, I think they’re serious about. The Fortnite update with their own payment processing was a publicity stunt.</p>

<p>The thing is, Epic isn’t just a game publisher. They’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games">a platform vendor too</a>. One of the core things developers want from a platform vendor is stability, in every sense of the word. If I were a game developer who depends on Unreal Engine, I’d be irate at Epic. They’re creating drama and eroding trust over a fight that Unreal Engine licensees aren’t a part of and didn’t sign up for. Fortnite users — especially kids — might blame Apple for Fortnite disappearing from iOS. But professional game developers will blame Epic if Unreal Engine updates are hindered by this.</p>

    <p class=""><a href="https://tidbits.com/2020/08/17/the-case-of-the-top-secret-ipod/"><span>David Shayer delivers another gem</span></a>, this one about when he was asked to work on a secret government project to make a “special” iPod that he speculates was used as a Geiger counter by James Bond types. I can’t help but wonder that if the government came knocking on the door of 2020 Apple, whether they’d so quickly let them into their software.</p><p class=""> </p>

    <p>India is the battleground for the soul of the internet. Global tech giants are carving another new piece in an internet that has already fractured into a Chinese net, US net and worse. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally tend to be the domain of nations and monopolies. We spent the last 3 years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. We use lasers instead of expensive underground fibre and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100× cheaper to deploy and 10× cheaper for customers.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Mac OS X Server 10.2 Server Assistant may stop responding (&#8220;hang&#8221; or &#8220;freeze&#8221;) when setting up your server if TCP/IP is not enabled on the built-in Ethernet port.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The fix:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Enable TCP/IP on the built-in Ethernet port while setting up Mac OS X Server 10.2. It is not required that an Ethernet cable actually be connected to the port, so long as TCP/IP is enabled on it.
