<blockquote>
<p>President Trump’s unfounded attacks on mail balloting <strong>are discouraging his own supporters from embracing the practice, according to polls</strong> and Republican leaders across the country, prompting growing alarm that one of the central strategies of his campaign is threatening GOP prospects in November.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voting by mail has always been viewed as favorable to Republicans—or at worst a wash. Democrats embraced it this year because it makes sense in the middle of a pandemic, but Donald Trump simply refused to believe that anybody, let alone Democrats, could possibly be acting altruistically. The only thing that made sense to him was that mail voting must be some kind of Democratic trick and therefore he was opposed to it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re so transactional and so cynical that you don&#8217;t believe non-selfish behavior is even possible. This should have been a no-brainer bipartisan initiative, but Trump didn&#8217;t believe it and no one in the Republican Party had the guts to tell him the truth. Now they&#8217;re getting exactly what they deserve.</p>

    <p>This morning, my buddy Jason Snell is launching <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/20-macs-for-2020-an-introduction/">a new project: &#8220;20 Macs for 2020,&#8221;</a> in which he is covering what he thinks are the most <em>notable</em> Macs. The list will include good, weird and even bad computers.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s kicking off the list <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/20-macs-for-2020-20-power-mac-g5/">with the Power Mac G5.</a></p>
<p>In addition to a new post every Monday, 20 Macs for 2020 <a href="https://www.relay.fm/20macs">also lives as a podcast on Relay FM.</a> On each episode, Snell talks to a group of Mac watchers and enthusiasts about the machine in question.</p>
<p>(Members of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade</a> or <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Six Colors</a> get access to new episodes before the general public.)</p>
<p>In addition to <em>that,</em> Jason and I are co-hosting a video series on the 512 Pixels YouTube channel, where we&#8217;re talking about and showing off the hardware featured in the list:</p>

    <p>After Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late ’90s, he famously simplified the company’s product line by drawing a four-product grid: consumer desktop (the bulbous, brightly colored G3 iMac), consumer laptop (then, just an empty space), professional desktop (the Power Mac, first the blue-and-white G3 and then the G4), and professional laptop (the PowerBook).</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There was no consumer laptop in Apple’s product line until the iBook was announced. PowerBooks were <em>expensive</em>. And as for that consumer desktop, the G3 iMac was a wild success<sup id="fnref-12429-imac"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-imac" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>, but for years the <em>real</em> Mac users looked down on it as a weird, underpowered toy that wasn’t suited for getting real work done<sup id="fnref-12429-work"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-work" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context, it’s easy to underestimate just how much importance the professional Mac tower had in the mind of the Mac world back in the day.  As defined by the standards of the 90s and early 2000s, these were <em>real</em> computers—boxes you could open up and swap hard drives, install RAM, stick in expansion cards, maybe even upgrade the processor itself. Time and trends and Apple’s own predilections have led us to a world, two decades later, where the only Mac that fits these criteria starts at $6,000, but back then the desktop tower was <em>the</em> Mac. The one that mattered.<sup id="fnref-12429-garbage"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-garbage" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Apple introduced an entirely new Mac tower, one that traded the cute colorful plastic of the Power Mac G3 and the more subdued gray and silver plastic of the Power Mac G4 for a more serious industrial design, clad in aluminum. In the early 2000s, colorful computers were for consumers and monochrome computers were for <em>serious</em> computer users.<sup id="fnref-12429-gray"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-gray" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/specs/powermac_g5_1.8.html">Power Mac G5</a> design represented the high-end Mac tower for a decade, keeping its distinctive look outside while adapting and changing on the inside. It survived the Intel transition. The G5 design, with a front panel punched so full of holes that it was 65 percent aluminum and 35 percent air, was so logical for a computer packed full of hot, high-powered components that after a six year hiatus, Apple brought back a Mac Pro that is deeply inspired by the design of the original. Like its predecessor, the 2019 Mac Pro also looks like nothing more than a giant box grater.</p>

<h2>An executive briefing</h2>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-cover-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5-cover" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Power Mac G5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwsn27J_tlo">was announced at WWDC in 2003</a> as “the world’s fastest personal computer.” Steve Jobs pointed out it was also the first 64-bit processor in a desktop computer, proudly trumpeting Apple’s partnership with IBM to create the G5 processor, which was replacing the Motorola-built PowerPC G4 at the top of Apple’s product line.</p>
<p>Apple was proud of the hardware design, so proud that I managed to score a hands-on briefing where I could walk through the design decisions with Apple execs for a cover story in Macworld. Macworld Expo in New York was coming up, so the only time we could meet was on the afternoon of July 3, the day before the long Independence Day weekend.</p>
<p>My wife and our one-year-old daughter and I were driving down to L.A. for the weekend, so we ended up stopping at Infinite Loop on the way south. A very nice Apple P.R. person (I wish I could remember who she was!) took them to the Company Store while I went into the executive briefing center. My daughter ended up with a new Apple onesie out of the deal.</p>
<p>The briefing was one for the books. Greg Jozwiak—who still frequently takes to the stage at Apple events—represented product marketing and Jon Rubinstein, Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering was there for the engineering side. For an hour, we stood around an opened-up G5 and walked through every little corner of that tower, as they told story after story about why particular design decisions had been made.</p>
<p>Today, that would be a podcast interview, and maybe a YouTube video. Back then, it generated three pages of photos showing both sides of the G5 motherboard, the inside of the case, and the front and back of the computer’s exterior, complete with quotes from both of them. It was an unusual way to do that story, right down to my insistence that we quote them at length and refer to them by their nicknames, Joz and Ruby.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-spread-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With 17 years of hindsight, the thing that sticks out the most about the G5’s design is just how obsessed it was about moving air around. Consider the two pro Macs that bracket this design: the previous tower, the final Power Mac G4, was nicknamed the “wind tunnel” because of its loud, aggressive fan noise. The 2013 Mac Pro, on the other hand, famously failed because it couldn’t keep its components cool enough, leading Apple into a “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">thermal corner</a>” from which it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The G5 was all about moving air around intelligently and quietly. In the WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs boasts about how it’s got nine fans, but you won’t hear them because they’re all individually computer controlled. If you took off the metal door on the outside of the G5, you’d be prompted by a clear plastic <em>second</em> door, this one there to keep the entire thermal container sealed. The power supply, processors, PCI cards, and storage bay were all separate air zones, moving from front to back.</p>
<p>Over the years, the airflow design on the inside changed as components changed, but the premise remained the same: Keep moving air through this thing so it can keep doing its job. It’s something the 2019 Mac Pro does, too. It’s a lesson learned from the Power Mac G5.</p>
<h2>Bunny suits and betrayal</h2>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/DSC01932-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Photo by Stephen Hackett.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t make Steve Jobs look like a fool. You will regret it.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://149426355.v2.pressablecdn.com/images/content/2020/steve-jobs-ibm-2-6c.jpg">history between Jobs and IBM</a>, it’s quite a thing to consider just how much praise Jobs and Apple lavished on IBM during the launch of the Power Mac G5.</p>
<p>The truth is, when Jobs returned to Apple he found the company in a vulnerable position when it came to Mac processors. The PowerPC chip architecture used in every Mac was a constant sore spot. It’s not quite fair to say Macs were always slower than comparable PCs running Intel processors, but they frequently were—and even when they weren’t, they often lagged behind in sheer clock speed. Try explaining to someone that a 1.5GHz Motorola G4 processor is actually faster than a 1.7 GHz Intel processor—either they won’t believe you because one number is larger than the other, or their eyes will just glaze over in boredom. (It happened on stage at Macworld Expo New York once. True story.)</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote back in 2003:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Anyone who’s paid attention to the competitive world of desktop computers has noticed that as PC chip makers Intel and AMD have accelerated their chips to incredibly high clock speeds, the G4 has lagged behind. Lately, even Apple seemed to stop protesting that the gap was purely mathematical and not real.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple ended up hitching the future of Mac chip development to IBM, its other PowerPC alliance partner. IBM had been focusing on high-end workstation processors, and that seemed like a good fit for the Power Mac line, at least. Then Apple went to work doing its marketing thing, with that IBM relationship at the center. Steve Jobs held up a polished silicon wafer and showed photos of the IBM factory in Fishkill, New York, where the G5 was being made.</p>
<p>If anyone remembers Macworld Expo New York 2003, it’s as the last hurrah of the show in New York before it crept back to Boston to die. Jobs didn’t even appear, but there was still an Apple keynote (led by marketing head Phil Schiller) and a hefty Apple presence. I remember it differently, mostly because I was part of a group of journalists who took a field trip upstate to Fishkill to see the IBM factory. We put on white bunny suits and wandered through a series of clean rooms where robots created IBM’s cutting-edge processors, including the G5.</p>
<p>What a world! I’d written about Apple for a decade, only to suddenly find myself in an IBM factory. It wasn’t quite Microsoft HQ, but it still felt like being in the belly of the beast. But this was a new world. IBM and its chip-making prowess was now the savior of the Mac. A big, beautiful G5 future was ahead.</p>
<p>So, about that…</p>
<p>In hindsight, it’s clear that Steve Jobs placed a trust in IBM that it simply didn’t merit. I have to believe Jobs thought IBM could deliver 3GHz G5 chips within 12 months. (The G5’s fastest chip at launch was a dual 2GHz model—meanwhile, Intel was already selling 3GHz chips.) It was “a guarantee the likes of which Apple had never before offered,” as I wrote back then. Jobs seemed confident, IBM seemed confident, and they sold that confidence.</p>
<p>Apple shipped Macs with G5 processors for three years. There was <em>never</em> a 3GHz G5 chip. While there eventually was a G5 iMac, there was <em>never</em> a G5 laptop. The architecture wasn’t ever conducive to being used on mobile devices. Steve Jobs accepted an IBM projection, made a promise, hyped its relationship with IBM…and got burned.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened next: Apple revved up a secret project to ensure that Mac OS X could compile for Intel processors. Less than three years after members of the media frolicked in bunny suits in Fishkill, Apple announced that it was dumping the PowerPC entirely and moving to Intel.  A couple of years later, Apple finally reached 3GHz with a Mac tower and it was a Mac Pro powered by an Intel Xeon processor.</p>
<p>Also in the background, Apple had begun talking to other chip design companies about alternatives to the G5, desperately trying to find a new chip to power its laptops. One of those companies was P.A. Semi, which Apple ended up buying outright in 2008. P.A. Semi’s engineering team became Apple’s chipmaking team.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the ultimate lesson of the entire G5 affair: Steve Jobs, and through him Apple’s larger corporate culture, was reminded that if you are reliant on a partner for a crucial portion of your business, you can’t truly control that business. Making the G5 was a side hustle of a side hustle of a company in transformation—it just wasn’t that important to IBM, but it was vitally important for Apple.</p>
<p>Jobs and Apple learned their lesson. The acquisition of P.A. Semi led to the A series of processors that run the iPhone and iPad. They are widely considered to be superior to the processors used by Apple’s competition. And now Apple has picked up stakes once again and plans to make Macs powered by new versions of those processors.</p>
<p>You could argue that the Power Mac G5 has IBM’s failure inscribed in its very name. But I prefer to consider the aluminum cheese-grater design as a classic that bridged the gap between IBM and Intel. It was a design too good to throw away, and after a brief blip, it’s still with us today—albeit in a modernized form with more stainless steel and weirder holes.</p>

Sticking around that long—27 years—has given me a deeper perspective on its history. I remember the Mac before OS X, before the iMac, before PowerPC, even before System 7. We go way back.</p>
<p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks, I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them, counting down to number one.</p>
<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these are my favorite Macs—a bunch of them I only knew in passing and never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever—a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>
<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular, revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/">Baseball 100 project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable omissions.</p>
<p>To this, I can only say: My rankings may be terrible, and my omissions unforgivable, but they’re mine. Play along, make your own list, post it to the Internet, and see if everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Or as Posnanski put it, “The point of this for me is not the ranking but the stories.”</p>
<p>To take this walk down memory lane, I’ve read through many back issues of Macworld, MacUser, and MacWEEK, picked up a few books, and talked to some of my distinguished Mac journalism colleagues. I appreciate their contributions to the project.</p>
<p>Beyond the arguments about list-making, I hope the results of this project will expose some Mac history that deserves to be brought back into the light while entertaining along the way.</p>
<p>In addition to my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/20macs">weekly essays here at Six Colors</a>, there will be an <a href="https://relay.fm/20macs">accompanying podcast</a> at Relay FM, and a video series (made in collaboration with Stephen Hackett) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">the 512 Pixels YouTube channel</a>.</p>

    <p>One of the things that makes numerical computation interesting is that it often reverses the usual conceptual order of things, using advanced math to compute things that are introduced earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example I recently ran across [1]. The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/trig_hyperbolic.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \sinh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \cosh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \tanh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)} \\ \end{align*} " width="222" height="131" /></p>
<p>But it may be more efficient to compute the exponential function in terms of hyperbolic functions. Specifically,</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_via_sinh.svg" alt="\exp(x) = \sinh(x) + \sqrt{\sinh(x)^2 + 1}" width="262" height="22" /></p>
<p>Why would you want to compute the simple thing on the left in terms of the more complicated thing on the right? Because hyperbolic sine is an odd function. This means that half its power series coefficients are zero: an odd function only has odd powers in its power series.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to compute the exponential function in an environment where you only have a limited number of registers to store constants. You can get more accuracy out of the same number of registers by using them to store coefficients in the power series for hyperbolic since than for exp.</p>
<p>If we store <em>n</em> coefficients for sinh, we can include powers of <em>x</em> up to 2<em>n</em> &#8211; 1. And since the coefficient of <em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> is zero, the error in our Taylor approximation is <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em>+1</sup>). See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/07/27/sine-approximation-for-small-x/">this post</a> for more on this trick.</p>
<p>If we stored <em>n</em> coefficients for exp, we could include powers of <em>x</em> up to <em>n</em>-1, and our error would be <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>).</p>
<p>To make things concrete, suppose <em>n</em> = 3 and <em>x</em> = 0.01. The error in the exp function would be on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>, but the error in the sinh function would be on the order of 10<sup>-14</sup>. That is, we could almost compute exp to single precision and sinh to almost double precision.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m glossing over a detail here. Would you really need to store, for example, the 1 coefficient in front of <em>x</em> in either series? For simplicity in the argument above I&#8217;ve implicitly said yes. Whether you&#8217;d actually need to store it depends on the details of your implementation.)</p>
<p>The error estimate above uses big-oh arguments. Let&#8217;s do an actual calculation to see what we get.</p>
<pre>    from math import exp, sinh, sqrt
    
    def exp_taylor(x):
        return 1 + x + 0.5*x**2
    
    def sinh_taylor(x):
        return x + x**3/6 + x**5/120
    
    def exp_via_sinh(x):
        s = sinh_taylor(x)
        return s + sqrt(s*s + 1)
    
    def print_error(approx, exact):
        print(f"Computed: {approx}")
        print(f"Exact:    {exact}")
        print(f"Error:    {approx - exact}")
    
    x = 0.01
    approx1 = exp_taylor(x)
    approx2 = exp_via_sinh(x)
    exact   = exp(x)
    
    print("Computing exp directly:\n")
    print_error(approx1, exact)
    
    print()
    
    print("Computing exp via sinh:\n")
    print_error(approx2, exact)
</pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre>    Computing exp directly:

    Computed: 1.0100500000000001
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    -1.6708416783473012e-07

    Computing exp via sinh:

    Computed: 1.0100501670841682
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    2.220446049250313e-16
</pre>
<p>Our errors are roughly what we expected from our big-oh arguments.</p>

    <p>If there’s a segment of Apple’s business that seems to fly in the face of the company’s philosophy—not just in terms of making a product that is substandard or lackluster—but in terms of actually being at odds with the way it otherwise does business, you couldn’t put forth a more prominent example than the App Store.</p>
<p>The discussion, always at a constant simmer in the Apple community, bubbled up once again last week even as Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled by lawmakers over antitrust concerns. Developers, regularly dissatisfied with the company’s lack of transparency and equality over rules, took the opportunity to renew criticism of not only that, but the hefty 30-percent cut of proceeds.</p>
<p>The App Store has been a profitable business for both developers and Apple in the decade-plus since its launch, but there’s a strong argument that as much of its benefits have accrued to those making the apps that feed it, just as much—if not more—has found its way into the coffers of the platform owner. Enough so that the company has built an entire fast-growing segment of its income around Services, amongst which the App Store is undoubtedly the crown jewel.</p>
<p>Apple’s impetus to keep on keeping on isn’t hard to understand. But, as the App Store embarks upon its second decade of operation, it may at least be worthwhile to investigate what changes could be made to improve it.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569278/time-for-apple-to-reevaluate-how-the-app-store-does-business.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

  Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1289710804338647040?s=20">@DongleBookPro</a> has today posted images of what seems to be a first-generation iPod Touch prototype with a 2013 Mac Pro-style glossy black finish.</p>
<p>  The Twitter user claims that the iPod Touch prototype pictured has &#8220;the same coating as the 2013 Mac Pro.&#8221; Had the finish been selected for the final product, it would have been the first metallic glossy black finish to be shipped on an Apple device.

<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the device:</p>

<p><strong>Classy free fonts</strong><br />
There are about 1,000 very classy fonts available for free on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. These are fonts you would actually want to use in your book or on your website. Some are commissioned by Google and designed by world-class typographers, such as the font Roboto used in Google maps. Many of these fonts come as families with different weights, italic, bold, extra glyphs, etc. This set of open fonts is also offered by Adobe and Monotype; what Google Fonts offer is a very nifty web interface for navigating through the collection, including good search and filter. I particularly like their font “pairing” function, which suggests good combinations of fonts (like text and captions pairings). All the fonts are license-free. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Craft in action</strong><br />
Everyone knows Anthony Bourdain’s various travel/food series, but in 2015 Bourdain did his hanging-out thing with master craftsman and craftswomen, going to their shops, watching them work with their tools, and at times trying his own hand at their craft. I can watch masters work all day. Their obsession with details is astounding, and their extreme excellence is captured in 14 episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdg0QhLNc29XuXmmv5Vu__bfNUeZI76ve&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Raw Craft</a>.

<p><strong>Words of wisdom from GPT-2</strong><br />
GPT-2 is an application that produces novel text based on a text prompt (<a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/run-openais-new-gpt-2-text-generator-code-with-your-gpu/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Here’s how to install it</a>). Most of what it generates hovers on the border of sense and nonsense. Here are four pieces of advice it has given to me.  — MF</p>
<ul class="revue-ul">
<li>“If we cannot make sense of the present, we cannot plan for the future.”</li>
<li>“The more we change to meet the challenges in our lives, not to stay where we are, the more successful we will be.”</li>
<li>“If it is an animal you have seen, do you think it will be like you, too? This is the first statement of my doctrine, that all things are one thing. Do you want me to prove it, or to let it pass?” —Philosopher Epicurus (384-399 A.D.)</li>
<li>“Your gut tells you it’s not right to continue investing in some idea–it’s too risky, because its consequences are hard to understand. Your gut is right about one thing, though: there is no way of knowing it’s not wrong to spend your energy making the best decision for yourself and your goals.”</li>

<p><strong>Fun and powerful photo editing app</strong><br />
It’s incredibly fun to use the <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-award-winning-luminar-4-bundle?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Luminar</a> photo editing application to bring my photos to life. (Here are some of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWnNav04OUZsflczhGitdZEpOTdBcVHd?usp=sharing&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">before-and-after photos</a>.) It has tons of adjustable preset filters and a lot of specialized tools such as portrait enhancement, where you can make the subject’s eyes larger and face thinner. You can also easily add in new skies and even a sun with rays. I typically use the “AI” set of adjustment tools to change the brightness and contrast because it does a great job without a lot of fussing on my part. The developer also has lots of excellent videos that show you how to use all the features in Luminar. Here’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/390496469?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">30-second video overview</a>. — MF</p>

    <p>Last week, Dan Moren wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/automate-this-how-hot-does-it-feel/">a nice post</a> about calculating the heat index in Shortcuts. I’d written a similar shortcut a few days earlier to calculate the dewpoint (it must be a summer thing), but it was kind of crappy and I had put it aside. Inspired by Dan’s work, I returned to my dewpoint shortcut and cleaned it up.</p>
<p>While I’m sure the dewpoint is included in some weather apps, it isn’t in the stock Weather app. It is, in theory at least, part of the data set returned by the <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> action in Shortcuts. I say “in theory” because I’ve found that quite often the Dewpoint entry is empty when that action is run. Why that is I don’t know, but that was the reason my original dewpoint shortcut was disappointing.</p>
<p>The improved shortcut, which you can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8443b306698142e2b0da7fd412c11045">download</a>, uses a calculation when <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> falls short. Here it is:</p>

<p>The <code>Weather Conditions</code> magic variable is used repeatedly in the shortcut to get at certain data. For example, when we need the temperature, we add <code>Weather Conditions</code> and choose Temperature from the list of data.</p>
<p><img alt="Specific info from weather conditions" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Specific%20info%20from%20weather%20conditions.jpg" title="Specific info from weather conditions" width="50%"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the name of the type of data chosen is displayed in the shortcut. For certain data, like Temperature, we also get to choose the units.</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing the units" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Choosing%20the%20units.jpg" title="Choosing the units" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Here’s the JavaScript code from Step 6:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:
 1:  function dewpoint(t, rh) {
 2:    let A = 17.625;
 3:    let B = 243.04;
 4:    let part = Math.log(rh/100) + A*t/(B + t);
 5:    return B*part/(A - part);
 6:  }
 7:  
 8:  let rh = ☐ Weather Conditions (Humidity);  // number
 9:  let t = '☐ Weather Conditions (Temperature)'; // string
10:  t = t.match(/[-\d.]+/);
11:  t = parseFloat(t);
12:  
13:  return dewpoint(t, rh)*9/5 + 32;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dewpoint</code> function is based on this equation:</p>

\[T_d = \frac{ B \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)   + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right]}{A - \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)  + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right] }\]

<p>This is a curve fit, where \(T\) is the normal (dry bulb) temperature in Celsius, \(RH\) is the relative humidity in percent, and \(T_d\) is the dewpoint in Celsius. The parameters that give a good fit are \(A = 17.625\) and \(B = 243.04\). I got the formula from <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225">this nice survey paper</a> by Mark Lawrence. Unfortunately, the paper has a typo in the value for \(A\), and I had to look up <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP5I-j3fzqAhUWCs0KHUNEBT8QFjABegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1175%2F1520-0450%25281996%2529035%253C0601%253AIMFAOS%253E2.0.CO%253B2&amp;usg=AOvVaw2b4OC7_lzQcU0vc5Jg5PO3">the original paper</a> by Oleg Alduchov and Robert Eskridge to get the correct value. Scholarship!</p>
<p>One of the great things about doing inline Scriptable is that you can stick Shortcuts variables directly into your JavaScript. That’s what’s happening with those weird-looking parts of Lines 8 and 9. Within the Scriptable step itself, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Shortcuts%20variables%20in%20Scriptable.jpg" title="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" width="50%"/></p>
<p>While the humidity is given as a number, the temperature is given as a string with “°C” at the end. Lines 10–11 extract the numeric part from the string<sup id="fnref:regex"><a href="#fn:regex" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and convert it from a string to a floating point number.</p>
<p>Finally, Line 13 converts the dewpoint temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Any complaints about this will be ignored.</p>
<p>Running Dewpoint directly from Shortcuts returns the output in this form:</p>
<p><img alt="Direct Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Direct%20Dewpoint%20output.png" title="Direct Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Running it in the Shortcuts widget on my phone returns the output within the widget:</p>
<p><img alt="Widget Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Widget%20Dewpoint%20output.jpg" title="Widget Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>This output is fine as written but not so good when spoken by Siri. There’s no pause between the temperature and the dewpoint. If experience shows that I’ll be using it mostly through Siri, I’ll change the Text definitions to be more like sentences.</p>

      • James Fallows | The Atlantic
      
        • by James Fallows
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve frequently mentioned my friend Michael Jones, a computer scientist and geography whiz. Nine years ago, he was a leading figure in my <em>Atlantic</em> story “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?utm_source=feed">Hacked</a>,” the saga of what my wife Deb and I learned when her email account was taken over by international hackers. For an <em>Atlantic</em> column around the same time, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/googles-michael-jones-on-how-maps-became-personal/266781/?utm_source=feed">interviewed him</a> on the way omnipresent, always-available mapping was likely to change people’s habits and lives. And before any of this, he had added to world knowledge with his explanation of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">Boiled Frog</a>” science. As he laid out in this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/07/guest-post-wisdom-on-frogs/21789/?utm_source=feed">guest post</a>, careful experiments in 19th-century Germany established that a frog would indeed sit still in a pot of ever-hotter water—but only if its brain had already been removed.  </p><p>Outside our household, Michael Jones is known, among other things, as one of the guiding forces behind Google Earth and Google Maps. When you see your neighborhood, or your planet, from above on a computer, or follow turn-by-turn directions on your phone, he is one of the people you have to thank.</p><p>Among the bright sides in the current pandemic nightmare is the news that this spring Michael <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">received the “Patron’s Medal”</a> from the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/">Royal Geographical Society</a>, in London. I am by nature wary of anything involving the concept of “Royal” (for reasons <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/?utm_source=feed">laid out long ago here</a>), but I make an exception in this case. I am delighted to learn of this overdue recognition for Michael Jones.</p><p>As the Society’s announcement put it:</p><blockquote>
<p>The 2020 Patron’s Medal has been awarded to Michael Jones for his contribution to the development of geospatial information.</p>

<p>Baroness Chalker said: “Michael Jones is a role model for future generations of geographers. From his beginnings as a software engineer, inventing and filing his own patents, through to his role as Google’s Chief Technology Advocate, his inspiring career trajectory is charted by his vision to redefine mapping from static lines and symbols to an interactive geographical web of context and information. It’s hard to overstate the importance that Google Earth and Google Maps has had on the public worldwide and how Michael’s pioneering work has democratised and popularised cartography and spatial awareness. Today we recognise his extraordinary contribution and his continued advocacy for the benefits of geography. He whole heartedly deserves the Society’s highest recognition.”</p>

<p>Michael Jones said: “This recognition is a signal honour for an idea that started in my head and which, through the work of many, resulted in the Google Earth used by billions of people around the world. On behalf of colleagues who laboured to make this dream of Earth and Maps a reality, and in full credit to the inspiring attainments of all who have come before us in the quest to better understand the Earth, I can only say that the ‘Earth-in-your-hand’ idea has never had a greater friend than the Royal Geographical Society, to whom we humbly offer our gratitude.”</p>
</blockquote><p>As a fellow Yank, I will razz Michael for writing “signal honour”—but it couldn’t be more deserved, with the British <em>u</em> or without. Congratulations. And you can read more about his story and outlook in <a href="https://www.rgs.org/geography/news/michael-jones-patron%E2%80%99s-medal-recipient-2020/">this interview</a>.</p><div class="feedflare">

    <p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/lunar_module.jpg" width="100%" alt="Lunar module and lunar rover, photo via NASA" class="size-medium" /></p>
<p>This post will illustrate two things: the amount of time astronauts have spent on the moon, and how to process dates and times in Python.</p>
<p>I was curious how long each Apollo mission spent on the lunar surface, so I looked up the timelines for each mission from NASA. Here&#8217;s the timeline for<a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm"> Apollo 11</a>, and you can find the timelines for the other missions by making the obvious change to the URL.</p>
<p>Here are the data on when each Apollo lunar module touched down and when it ascended.</p>
<pre>
    data = [
        ("Apollo 11", "1969-07-20 20:17:39", "1969-07-21 17:54:00"),
        ("Apollo 12", "1969-11-19 06:54:36", "1969-11-20 14:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 14", "1971-02-05 09:18:13", "1971-02-06 18:48:42"),
        ("Apollo 15", "1971-07-30 22:16:31", "1971-08-02 17:11:23"),
        ("Apollo 16", "1972-04-21 02:23:35", "1972-04-24 01:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 17", "1972-12-11 19:54:58", "1972-12-14 22:54:37"),
    ]
</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s a first pass at a program to parse the dates and times above and report their differences.</p>
<pre>
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def str_to_datetime(string):
        return datetime.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    def diff(str1, str2):
        return str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)

    for (mission, touchdown, liftoff) in data:
        print(f"{mission} {diff(liftoff, touchdown)}")
</pre>
<p>This works, but the formatting is unsatisfying.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21:36:21
    Apollo 12 1 day, 7:31:11
    Apollo 14 1 day, 9:30:29
    Apollo 15 2 days, 18:54:52
    Apollo 16 2 days, 23:02:12
    Apollo 17 3 days, 2:59:39
</pre>
<p>It would be easier to scan the output if it were all in hours. So we rewrite our <code>diff</code> function as follows.</p>
<pre>
    def diff(str1, str2):
        delta = str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)
        hours = delta.total_seconds() / 3600
        return round(hours, 2)
</pre>
<p>Now the output is easier to read.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21.61
    Apollo 12 31.52
    Apollo 14 33.51
    Apollo 15 66.91
    Apollo 16 71.04
    Apollo 17 74.99
</pre>
<p>These durations fall into three clusters, corresponding to the Apollo mission types G, H, and J.  Apollo 11 was the only G-type mission. Apollo 12, 13, and 14 were H-type, intended to demonstrate a precise landing and explore the lunar surface. (Apollo 13 had to loop around the moon without landing.) The J-type missions were more extensive scientific missions. These missions included a lunar rover (&#8220;moon buggy&#8221;) to let the astronauts travel further from the landing site. There were no I-type missions; the objectives of the original I-type missions were merged into the J-type missions.</p>
<p>Incidentally, UNIX systems store times as seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00. That means the first two lunar landings were at negative times and the last four were at positive times. More on UNIX time <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/02/05/leap-seconds/">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="">In light <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/tech/tiktok-trump-bytedance-sale/index.html">of current events</a>, I’ve been paying more attention to TikTok lately. By “paying attention”, I mean I’ve been watching the nightly batch of puppy TikToks that my daughters have lovingly curated for me.</p><p class="">So from this perspective, I didn’t understand what the big deal was with TikTok and why folks are talking about banning it in the United States. It turns out the issue is much more complicated than puppy videos. If you’d like to get up to speed, Ben Thompson&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/"><span>summarizes and adds some insight.</span></a></p>

    <p>Katherine Eban has a longish piece in <em>Vanity Fair</em> about how the White House—and Jared Kushner in particular—handled the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, there&#8217;s a passage examining why Kushner and Trump <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air">showed little interest in a national plan:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: <strong>that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically.</strong> “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.</p>
<p>That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a scoop, though, since it was widely known among reporters at the time. Kushner, who was a sort of free-roving coronavirus troubleshooter in the early days, apparently started out trying to put together a national plan with his team of college pals and young banker types, but it never saw the light of day. By the end of April, partisan considerations had overwhelmed everything. Kushner and Trump decided that instead of putting in place a plan that would effectively crush the virus, they wanted a plan that would most effectively boost Trump&#8217;s reelection plans.</p>
<p><strong>OBLIGATORY NOTE:</strong> The White House, of course, denies all of this. Given their track record for lying about everything, however, there&#8217;s no need for you to take this seriously.</p>
<p>In any case, with Kushner in charge it&#8217;s not clear just how good a national plan would have been anyway. Kushner&#8217;s mysterious planeloads of pandemic supplies have been documented before, but Eban provides a case study of one particular Kushner brainstorm that illustrates how his &#8220;just get shit done&#8221; attitude played out in real life. The idea was to order millions of Chinese-made COVID-19 test kits from an outfit in the Middle East:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Normally, federal government purchases come with detailed contracts, replete with acronyms and identifying codes.</strong> They require sign-off from an authorized contract officer and are typically made public in a U.S. government procurement database, under a system intended as a hedge against waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>
<p><strong>This purchase did not appear in any government database. Nor was there any contract officer involved.</strong> Instead, it was documented in an invoice obtained by <em>Vanity Fair</em>, from a company, Cogna Technology Solutions (its own name misspelled as “Tecnology” on the bill), which noted a total order of 3.5 million tests for an amount owed of $52 million. The “client name” simply noted “WH.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be off base here, but the thing that really drew my attention was the invoice itself:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856616"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856616" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_cogna_invoice.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="1695"></figure>
<p>Does this even look like a real invoice? It&#8217;s not aligned right; it has misspelled words; there&#8217;s no customer information and no order reference; and just based on having seen lots of invoices in my time, it doesn&#8217;t look real. It looks like something that was whomped up in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all. The test kits were delivered in late March, but they were no good. &#8220;An FDA spokesperson told <em>Vanity Fair</em> the tests may have been rendered ineffective because of how they were stored when they were shipped from the Middle East. &#8216;The reagents should be kept cold,&#8217; the spokesperson said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reagents should be kept cold.&#8221; No kidding. A freshman chemistry major could have guessed that. But this kind of planning is what passes for brilliant thinking among the Kushnerites and the Trump administration in general. Ideology aside, it turns out that it really does matter if the president of the United States is competent.</p>

    <p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida
law enforcement placed a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida, under
arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the
biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history, one
that took over the accounts of President Barack Obama,
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon
Musk, Kanye West, Apple, and more to perpetrate a huge bitcoin
scam on July 15th.</p>

<p>But apparently, he wasn’t alone: shortly after the Tampa arrest
was revealed and after we published this story, two more
individuals were formally charged by the US Department of Justice:
22-year-old Nima Fazeli in Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard
in the UK. They go by the hacker aliases “Rolex” and “Chaewon,”
respectively, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>

<p>According to federal agents, Sheppard had used a personal driver’s
license to verify himself with the Binance and Coinbase
cryptocurrency exchanges, and his accounts were found to have sent
and received some of the scammed bitcoin. Fazeli also used a
driver’s license to verify with Coinbase, where accounts
controlled by “Rolex” allegedly received payments in exchange for
stolen Twitter usernames.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears Twitter wasn’t the victim of anything vaguely approaching an expert caper. These kids are <a href="https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1289396815003922435">such dingbats</a> they used Bitcoin accounts opened in their own names. This profoundly disturbing and dangerous hack was pulled off by unsophisticated pranksters.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder what actual expert hackers are getting away with on Twitter.</p>

    <p>Wait, sorry, this is the reality show one, not the fictional one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once considered a potential successor to Rupert Murdoch, Mr.
Murdoch on Friday resigned from the board of the newspaper
publisher News Corp, severing his last corporate tie to his
father’s global media empire.</p>

<p>“My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial
content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other
strategic decisions,” Mr. Murdoch, 47, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/james-murdoch-s-resignation-letter/5d16f07153370f9d/full.pdf">wrote in his resignation
letter</a>, which News Corp disclosed in a filing shortly after the
close of business on Friday.</p>
