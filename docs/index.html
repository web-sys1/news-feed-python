    <p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida
law enforcement placed a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida, under
arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the
biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history, one
that took over the accounts of President Barack Obama,
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon
Musk, Kanye West, Apple, and more to perpetrate a huge bitcoin
scam on July 15th.</p>

<p>But apparently, he wasn’t alone: shortly after the Tampa arrest
was revealed and after we published this story, two more
individuals were formally charged by the US Department of Justice:
22-year-old Nima Fazeli in Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard
in the UK. They go by the hacker aliases “Rolex” and “Chaewon,”
respectively, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>

<p>According to federal agents, Sheppard had used a personal driver’s
license to verify himself with the Binance and Coinbase
cryptocurrency exchanges, and his accounts were found to have sent
and received some of the scammed bitcoin. Fazeli also used a
driver’s license to verify with Coinbase, where accounts
controlled by “Rolex” allegedly received payments in exchange for
stolen Twitter usernames.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears Twitter wasn’t the victim of anything vaguely approaching an expert caper. These kids are <a href="https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1289396815003922435">such dingbats</a> they used Bitcoin accounts opened in their own names. This profoundly disturbing and dangerous hack was pulled off by unsophisticated pranksters.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder what actual expert hackers are getting away with on Twitter.</p>

Murdoch on Friday resigned from the board of the newspaper
publisher News Corp, severing his last corporate tie to his

letter</a>, which News Corp disclosed in a filing shortly after the

<p>Mr. Trump, who said on Friday that he was considering “banning

    <p>Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a
small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack.
A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to
both our internal network as well as specific employee
credentials that granted them access to our internal support
tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had
permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers
used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain
information about our processes. This knowledge then enabled them
to target additional employees who did have access to our account
support tools. Using the credentials of employees with access to
these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts,
ultimately Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and
downloading the Twitter Data of 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t find the level of detail here satisfying at all. I don’t expect Twitter to reveal the exact details of what happened, but this just isn’t enough. My guess is that they’re saying that the attackers targeted low-level employees via the phone, tricked them into revealing details, and used those details to (here’s where the guessing starts) impersonate them on Twitter’s internal Slack. Then, impersonating them on Slack, they tricked other employees into giving them access to these incredibly sensitive account management tools?</p>

<p>What seems clear is that internally, Twitter was inexcusably sloppy with sharing access to incredibly sensitive account management tools.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been spending more time at my mother&#8217;s house than at my own, which means I&#8217;m mostly taking pictures of her cats these days. This one is a picture of Stripey, who was rolling around on the driveway until she caught a glimpse of my camera and immediately became a cat of considerable purpose. And what is that purpose? To stick her nose into the lens and then take a few swats at it. She seems to think of the camera as a new playmate.</p>

    <p>You think <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/07/chart-of-the-day-gdp-plummets-in-q2/">we have it bad?</a> GDP plunged by 11.9 percent in Europe during the second quarter of the year. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856430"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1270px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856430" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_eu_gdp_q2_2020.gif" alt="" width="1270" height="622"></figure>
<p>There is, however, a bright side to this: Europe has mostly crushed COVID-19. They took their shutdown more seriously than we did, and they kept it in place for about a month longer. The result is an economic crash even worse than ours, but with prospects of a full recovery this year now that the virus is under control. By the end of the year we&#8217;ll know for sure whether the European or American strategy worked better in the long run.</p>

    <p>CNet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duke’s account “has been permanently suspended for Twitter Rules on hateful conduct,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. Twitter’s policy, revised in March, prohibits posts that promote violence or threats of violence against people based on their religion, race or ethnic origin.</p>

<p>It wasn’t immediately clear what specific post or posts by Duke led to the account’s ban. The verified account for Duke, the founder and former Grand Dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was blank Thursday, replaced with a message that the account had been “permanently suspended.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine going back in time 30 years and explaining to someone that in the future, there are privately-owned computer networks for socializing and sharing your thoughts, observations, and opinions, and that David Duke got kicked off the one that is most popular in news media circles.</p>

<p>“Ha, probably happened the first day,” your circa 1990 friend might say.</p>

<p>“No, actually, it took more than 10 years.”</p>

<p>“What? Does David Duke repent in the future? Does he disavow white supremacy?”</p>

<p>“No he doesn’t change at all.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any sense.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you find out who the president is. Sleep tight.”</p>

My first one are the shoes I wear probably about 363 and a half days of the year, which are Onitsuka Tigers, Mexico 66. These sneakers have kind of an interesting history among the earliest dedicated athletic shoes designed and made in Japan. I was a cross country runner in high school, and we had these shoes that were lightweight and made just for running. You didn&#8217;t really wear them around. And there was something about them being purpose built, made for running. I also played sports, baseball and basketball, and there were shoes for those things, but these running shoes felt a little more exotic, maybe because running wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. And so I wore them very excitedly back then, even though I hated running and still hate running. Then over the years, as I got older, I came across this literature on barefoot exercise and that led down a rabbit hole and another rabbit hole. And I realized I wasn&#8217;t going to go around barefoot because the world is too built up to really be barefoot. But I did want to go to some form of minimalism. And then I found out that these Onitsuka Tigers had been resurrected, I think in the early 2000s. And now they&#8217;re kind of a style sneaker. I love them because they&#8217;re essentially, a ballet flat that you can wear every day. They&#8217;re incredibly lightweight and I&#8217;d come to believe, through an episode we did a Freakonomics Radio called, something like These Shoes are Killing Me, where we looked into the physiology of feet and how humans are meant to walk and run, that we aren&#8217;t meant to wear these big, built up shoes with all this cushioning. And in fact, there&#8217;s a good reason to think that where the more protection you wear, the more your body kind of atrophies and responds in the wrong ways. And so these are sneakers comfortable enough to barely know you&#8217;re wearing a shoe. They&#8217;re supportive enough to walk on anything, rocks, whatever. You can run and play golf and do anything in them. And they also come in enough styles and colors and so on that if you care about such things, which I tend to mostly not, you can have a beautiful pair that you can wear as the equivalent of a dress or work shoe. And so I think they are a really cool tool.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00F3GYMKU/cooltoolsshow-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anchovy paste</a> ($8)<br />
My second cool tool is, oh anchovy paste. This is not exotic or unknown, unless it is. I&#8217;m guessing that most people who cook know about anchovy paste, but everybody&#8217;s at different stages of learning. And when I learned to use anchovy paste in my cooking, I felt like it was the first cool tool of cooking I learned years ago. And now we keep it stocked in abundance. And basically if you don&#8217;t know anchovy paste, it is the paste of anchovies in a kind of toothpaste type tube. Anchovy paste is the nitro version of the umami that you need in whatever you need. For instance, if you want to make the best Brussels sprouts ever, you would chop your Brussels sprouts relatively small, and then you sauté maybe some shallots and or garlic, in your butter and or oil before the Brussels sprouts hit the pan. But it&#8217;s the anchovy paste that you put in while you&#8217;re sautéing there that will just bring it to the next level. Also works for all kinds of sauces and is just a really good thing to have around. Especially if you have someone in your family that does not eat fish and is scared of all things from the sea, but also likes flavorful things. You just have to hide it. And occasionally I&#8217;ll make a label for something else and call it like clown juice and put it on the anchovy paste canister, so that we fool everybody. There&#8217;s a brand called Amore, which happens to be Italian. I&#8217;m not sure their anchovies are any tastier than the others, but it&#8217;s really useful.</p>

<a href="https://www.puzzleyou.com/photo-puzzle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puzzleYOU</a> — jigsaw puzzle made from your own photo<br />
We don&#8217;t do jigsaw puzzles as a family the way we did when they were younger, but my wife still likes a jigsaw puzzle now and again, but she&#8217;d really put it aside for years and years, but during the pandemic, like a lot of people, she was looking for activities to do. I take that back. She started on this before COVID, for some reason. She just felt like doing some jigsaw puzzles. And so she had a few. And in fact, the reason I remember it was before is because my wife got very sick with COVID and so we quarantined her at home and it was tough. One of the first things she was able to do when she was starting to recover was to get down on the floor to do the jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle kind of became the symbol of her quarantine and to this day now, a few months later, she&#8217;s still doing jigsaw puzzles and we all pitch in now and again, but for Mother&#8217;s Day, my daughter, teenage daughter found a really nice gift idea, which was a custom made jigsaw puzzle made of a photo that you send in. It doesn&#8217;t shock me that it exists, but I was thrilled that it does exist. We selected a photo that we thought she would like a lot. It was a photo of my son and I playing this board game, an election board game. And our little dog had its paws up on the table over the game as if it was playing the board game. It&#8217;s one of those kind of vaguely comical anthropomorphizing dog photos. But it happened that this photo happened to have a lot of things in the background that really read like our family. There&#8217;s a portrait on the wall behind the scene that showed the four of us. And there was an old photograph of my wife&#8217;s dad in the army on on the sidewall. It was his photo that was composed of all these things that represented our family. And we turned that into a jigsaw puzzle and gave it to my wife, Ellen, for Mother&#8217;s Day. And when the box comes from this company, they have a message. We put something like, &#8220;Happy Mother&#8217;s Day, love you.&#8221; And it was one of the best gifts that&#8217;s ever happened.</p>

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Word</a><br />
You will mark me as a combination Luddite and well, that&#8217;s not the opposite of a Luddite, but something else really bad. My fourth cool tool and my most important by far is Microsoft Word. It is a computer program made by a company called Microsoft. And it is for making words, things like writing. Look, I recognize that I love Microsoft Word in part because I&#8217;ve been using it for a long time. I&#8217;m a writer. It&#8217;s what I do. I&#8217;ve written a lot of books. I&#8217;ve used Word on all of them, although I should also say I started writing before Microsoft Word existed. The first computer I wrote on was something called the IBM Display Writer which had a huge floppy disk drive. And there was one disc for composing and another disc for editing and another disc for spell checking and so on. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m wed to it because it was the only program I ever used. I used WordPerfect and I wrote on Commodores and I wrote on early Mac and so on, but I think Word is an amazing program because it does everything I would ever want it to do for any kind of writing. And I only use probably about a half a percent of it. And I got to know Nathan Myhrvold, a little bit, one of the former CTOs of Microsoft, who I believe was involved along with a lot of other people in creating this and had some conversations just about it. And I&#8217;m just constantly amazed at how well thought through it is. And I know some people get intimidated by it. I know some people think it&#8217;s overkill. I know some people think it&#8217;s not modern and beautiful enough, but I think it&#8217;s a tool that helps me do my best work writing. And I&#8217;m really, truly grateful for it.</p>

    <p>Consumer spending increased in June, but it&#8217;s still about $1 trillion below where it ought to be:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856367"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1266px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856367" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_consumer_spending_june_2020.gif" alt="" width="1266" height="622"></figure>
<p>Even though national income increased thanks to stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits, people still aren&#8217;t willing to spend like they used to. Instead they&#8217;re saving more than normal, and who can blame them? If they had more confidence in both the federal response to COVID-19 and Republican willingness to continue benefits to the unemployed, spending might be closer to normal. But they don&#8217;t, so it&#8217;s not.</p>

    <p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2020/07/will-craft-brewing-survive/614488/?utm_source=feed">I mentioned</a> the surprisingly important role that craft brewing had played in downtown renewal across the country over the past decade. And I talked with one of the pioneers of that movement, Jim Koch of the Boston Beer Company, about how this part of America’s startup economy was likely to fare.</p><p>Here are reports from two companies of a similar spirit but entirely different scale from Koch’s nationally distributed Samuel Adams brand. One is in northern Minnesota; the other, on the edge of the Mojave desert in Southern California. Each illustrates a path small, locally conscious firms are taking to survive the current economic and public health disaster.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><strong>Duluth, Minnesota</strong>: Over the past four years, I’ve visited <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/03/craft-breweries-no-im-not-kidding-they-actually-matter-in-civic-development/476220/?utm_source=feed">and written about</a> the small <a href="http://www.bentpaddlebrewing.com/">Bent Paddle Brewing Company</a> of Duluth—and have retained interest because the saga of this startup has involved a lot more than its (very good) craft beer.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bentpaddlebrewing.com/brewery/origin-story.php">two young couples</a> who founded the company ten years ago—Karen and Bryon Tonnis, and Laura and Colin Mullen—wanted to see if their new little business could be part of a larger revival in the tattered, ex-industrial Lincoln Park district of Duluth. As Deb Fallows and I saw in repeat visits and reported <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/03/craft-breweries-no-im-not-kidding-they-actually-matter-in-civic-development/476220/?utm_source=feed">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/04/paradise-duluth/477639/?utm_source=feed">here</a>, they had begun succeeding in that neighborhood-revival role—plus others, like being part of a <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1924981/why-duluth-best-town-america">Duluth’s emergence</a> as an outdoors and tourist destination, and helping <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/04/on-national-beer-day-craft-brewers-improving-water-and-life-in-more-ways-than-one/477429/?utm_source=feed">protect the waters</a> of deep, cold Lake Superior, on whose western tip Duluth sits.</p><p>Each time we’ve visited their part of town, we’ve seen a few more visitors, another restaurant or food truck, another little office or store. Meanwhile, Bent Paddle’s main business, as a taproom and brewery, continued to grow. Every time we talked, the four founders stressed that they’d grown mainly thanks to community supports (including advice from local business people and loans from local banks), so they felt an obligation to be part of the community’s long-term development.</p><figure><img alt="" height="459" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/original-15/410bc2770.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">The Bent Paddle team, in 2016. From left, Bryon Tonnis, Karen Tonnis, Laura Mullen, and Colin Mullen. (James Fallows / The Atlantic)</figcaption></figure><p>But what now? This spring, Bent Paddle’s own taproom was of course closed, as were the restaurants and bars through which it sold most of its output. Could a little business like this survive, and could its surrounding neighborhood? This week I spoke with Laura Mullen in Duluth to ask how Bent Paddle had fared.</p><p>“During March and April our business was down about 50 percent,” she said. “No events at our site,” which had been an ever-busier civic gathering center. (We once saw a <a href="https://mariezhuikov.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/a-funny-thing-happened-at-bent-paddle-taproom/">local-writer’s club</a> holding a meeting in a side room.) “No sales to bars or restaurants,” which were about half of its total volume. “Draft beer was not happening anywhere.” Bent Paddle had to buy back some of the kegs it had shipped to bars and restaurants. Other kegs, already in warehouses, went past their shelf life and could no longer be sold.</p><p>Fortunately from the brewers’ point of view, Minnesota classified liquor stores as some of the “essential” businesses that could stay open despite a general lockdown. “That made us ‘essential workers,’” Mullen said, “because we were supplying products to liquor stores.”</p><p>Among the customers they could still reach in Duluth and elsewhere, Bent Paddle saw the same pattern that Jim Koch, of Sam Adams, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2020/07/will-craft-brewing-survive/614488/?utm_source=feed">recently described</a> to me: People who would otherwise have gone out to a restaurant or bar were in many cases “trading up” to buy nicer food or drink to have at home, still for a lower overall cost. (A fascinating <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/rebalancing-the-covid-19-effect-on-alcohol-sales/">report in Nielsen.com</a> shows exactly how much at-home drinking would have to increase to offset the near-elimination of bar and restaurant revenues. Medical experts are <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/07/01/covid-19-pandemic-brings-new-concerns-about-excessive-drinking">on the alert</a> for evidence that <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/07/01/covid-19-pandemic-brings-new-concerns-about-excessive-drinking">increased home drinking</a> is creating medical or behavioral risks—beyond those of the pandemic itself.)</p><p>Laura Mullen said that she expected this year’s sales, overall, to be about 20 percent lower than last year’s. Of the company’s 44 staff members before the shutdowns, it laid off 10. All but one has now returned. The company received a PPP loan to help cover the salaries. For the moment, Minnesota has allowed bars and restaurants to reopen for distanced outside service, and at 50 percent previous capacity indoor.</p><p>What were the lessons of this company’s survival, so far? Laura Mullen suggested these:</p><ul><li><em>An immediate pivot:</em> “When the taproom closed, we could still do to-go beer,” she said. “The minute [the state order] hit, after we shut the taproom we created all these signs and online videos,” promoting the idea that Bent Paddle was still open and explaining how to buy very safely canned beer to take home.  </li>
</ul><figure><img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/BentPaddleBrewingCo_CovidPreparedness6/9b997c21a.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Instructions on buying beer, in the time of COVID (Courtesy of Bent Paddle Brewing Co.)</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Going all-in on masks and distancing:</em> None of the signs and videos that Bent Paddle put up were about resisting or working around the shutdown or distancing order. All were about how to work with the rules. On March 20, they posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=258626025142051">a three-minute Facebook video</a> in which Laura Mullen walked potential customers all through the stages of picking up beer safely from their brewery. “We get a few Yelp comments complaining about our procedures,” she told me. “But we got many more complimenting us and saying that our safety protocols were top-notch, and they could feel comfortable coming here.”</li>
</ul><figure><img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/BentPaddleBrewingCo_CovidPreparedness10/beefbd8f5.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Bent Paddle’s newly distanced outdoor seating (Courtesy of Bent Paddle Brewing Co.)</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Reliance on the local:</em> When I first met them, the four Bent Paddle founders told me how important local-bank support had been when they started the company. Laura Mullen said the same was true for surviving the current emergency. “A lot of people who had bigger-bank relationships had trouble getting their PPP loans,” she said. “We have a small local bank,” whose officers the company had worked with for years, “and we were able to get things arranged very quickly. We’ve heard that across the board, that people dealing with smaller banks are in better shape.”</li>
</ul><p></p><ul><li><em>Concern for the neighborhood:</em> Bend Paddle’s success has been an important part of the Lincoln Park area’s revitalization. Now people are still coming to pick up beer, but not staying to shop in the little boutiques and smaller businesses. Their margins are thinner, and their products are less recession-proof than beer. Mullen said that she was even more concerned about longer-term effects on the neighborhood than on her own company.</li>
</ul><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><b>Redlands, California:</b> More than a dozen years ago, when I was living in China, I visited my original hometown of Redlands several times (for family-illness <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/tiger-jim/?utm_source=feed">reasons</a>) <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/03/i-was-born-too-soon-part-9-482/7978/?utm_source=feed">and noted</a> the emergence of a craft-brew industry there. The pioneering local company was sited right at a small airport and was named, with an aviation theme, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/the-rise-of-hangar-24/274308/?utm_source=feed">Hangar 24</a>.</p><p>On recent visits to Redlands I’ve noted the emergence of a new company, called <a href="https://escapecraftbrewery.com/">Escape Craft Brewery</a>. It’s located in an unglamorous commercial complex not far from Interstate 10, but its vibe and style are of the tropical carefree getaway. “We designed the name <em>Escape</em> for that idea,” Melissa Fisher, who cofounded the brewery with her husband Josh six years ago, told me last week. “You can’t always get away. But you can always <em>escape</em>. You can sit outside, open a beer, and be someplace else for a few minutes.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="330" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/Escape/a8e0443f4.png" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of Escape Craft Brewery</figcaption></figure><p>Before opening the company, Josh Fisher was an avid home brewer, with a day job as a firefighter. Melissa worked as an aesthetician in a salon. They spent two years scouting the area for an appropriate site—with parking, brewing space and facilities, affordable rent, appropriate zoning, outdoor patio space for the usually warm Southern California weather, and so on.</p><p>They found it in a modest storefront close to the I-10 freeway, amid discount stores and carpet-cleaning shops. Based mainly on the quality of their products, Escape’s beers and ambience grew in popularity. It expanded into a next-door property and had 10,000 square feet of space, about half of it for a tasting-room and taproom, and half for a game room where, according to Melissa Fisher, they also had live music, private parties, “dog adoptions” and other civic events. This August they had been planning to open a second site in Redlands, with renovation of an an abandoned warehouse building much closer to downtown. They were also preparing for an expansion to the resort-coastal city of Laguna Niguel.</p><p>In March, most of their business went away, all at once. No taproom traffic, which had been almost 80 percent of their total revenue. No private events, no live music, no community gatherings—and on top of that, no sales to the bars and restaurants that had been carrying Escape’s beers. “A couple of places even asked if they could send their kegs back,” Melissa Fisher said. “Usually that’s illegal, but the rules were lifted this time”—and they were legally able to re-package some of the product as “beer to go.”</p><figure class="right"><img alt="" height="433" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/IMG_1576/4b5599b19.jpg" width="325"><figcaption class="caption">Melissa and Josh Fisher, inside the Escape tap room (Courtesy of Escape Craft Brewery)</figcaption></figure><p>How would they survive? “I think that if this had been in our first year or two, it would have been monumentally bad for us,” Melissa Fisher said. “We probably could not have made it.” But in Escape’s six years of operation, it had built a local following, and the Fishers had saved their profits to invest in their planned expansions (and instead are using them to cushion losses now).</p><p>Like Bent Paddle, Escape quickly shifted, mainly to take-out sales. Instead of draft beer poured into glasses in the tap rooms, they would sell beer in cans for customers to pick up. (Side note: a decade ago, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/02/it-appears-that-i-was-very-very-wrong-about-canned-beer/252970/?utm_source=feed">was surprised by</a> the shift among craft brewers from glass bottles to aluminum cans. Now the shift is all but complete. I can barely remember the last time I bought beer that came in a bottle.) It quickly put up a website for online orders of to-go beer and saw many of its longtime customers make that change.</p><p>This kept the doors open, but with an unpleasant real-world surprise. In the previous post I mentioned the all-important role of something most beer customers are barely aware of: the beer-wholesalers business. In the case of Escape, the challenging practicality was how hard and expensive it could be for a small operation like theirs to try to switch to canned-beer sales.</p><p>Start with the cans themselves. “A big brewer might pay 8 or 10 cents per can,” Fisher said. Because they’re buying in small volume, “We’re paying somewhere between 34 and 74 cents per can, and that’s before we put the label on it”—or the beer into it. “Then you run into the shortages because there’s a rush on everything”—of cans, of labels, of glass growler bottles, of aluminum “crowler” cans. Before the pandemic, state regulators had to pre-approve the labels for canned beer. Now they have waived some of the rules, and Fisher and her team have been filling in part of the label information with Sharpies.</p><p>At the taproom, a pint of beer might have sold for six or seven dollars, so a round of four pints would bring in more than $25. Those same four pints, as a take-out order, go for $10 or $12, of which three dollars or more would be just for the labels and cans.</p><p>So the Fishers are selling beer but at a tiny margin, which barely covers their costs. Before, with full service, they would typically have six or seven employees on a Friday night. Now, to manage take-out, they have one or two. (Several of the employees have voluntarily reduced their hours, so others can have them.) Escape has expanded outdoor seating, in the parking areas and loading dock outside their tap room. “We’re lucky to have that space,” Melissa Fisher said. “But when it’s 98 to 102 degrees—even when we have cooling machines, even with a beer—not everyone can handle being outside.” Like many other brewers and distillers, they’ve also been selling a line of hand sanitizer.</p><p>“What we’re making now, is keeping the lights on,” she said. “And we’ve had a huge amount of support from people who’ve become our friends.” Because of their savings, and adaptability, they expect to keep going, and ultimately to expand. But what they’re doing now isn’t sustainable, she said. “Something has to change.”</p><p>Something does. Stories like these deserve notice, in my view, because little businesses like Bent Paddle and Escape have played such an outsize role in bringing vitality and local-connectedness to so many American towns.</p><p>Coming next, two other stories, with other implications, from northern Florida and the Bay Area of California. And after the jump, reactions from two brewers.</p><p>In response to the item earlier this week, Jim Koch, of Boston Beer Company adds this point. He is discussing the recent change in Massachusetts beer-distributor laws, which his company support even though it will help all local beer companies <em>except</em> his:</p><blockquote>
<p>I realized there was one major thing I missed in our discussion that makes what happened in MA surprising in a business context.  That is the craft beer ethos that we are as much colleagues as competitors and that if we all act for the good of each other, we will all, in the long term, benefit even if there is short term sacrifice.  </p>

<p>I think that attitude, which often means sharing “trade secrets” and ideas and helping each other out with ingredients or equipment, has been an important part of our success and is rare in US business.  It also makes for a happier professional life if you can look at your competitors as colleagues and friends.  It is exemplified in the craft brewer practice that when you’re having beers with each other, each of you orders the other’s beer rather than your own.  </p>
</blockquote><p>And, a note from someone on the other end of the craft-brewing spectrum from Koch. This person writes from Florida, and from a small, newish company, but he shares Koch’s concern about arcane distribution laws. He writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>As a small craft brewer in Florida … we will survive due to the support of our community and our location. Some of my good friends in this industry may not make it. [One reason is …] beer distributors and their death grip on the craft beer industry - it’s important to our overall survival.</p>

<p>We have a very good relationship with our distributor. They are good people and our goals are aligned. But Florida franchise law, as it is, makes me pray these goals remain aligned because should they diverge, just like any Florida brewer - I will most certainly be on the losing side of any dispute. I’d like to see this inequity balanced for the good of the industry.”</p>

    <p>Notoriously secret as Apple is, there are but a limited number of ways to discover what exactly the company is developing. Thanks to our current ongoing pandemic, my surefire proprietary method—rooting through the compost bins, discarded smoothie containers, and perfectly round pizza boxes in Apple Park’s industrial trash compactors—has become impractical.</p>
<p>So I’m left instead with virtual trawling—which smells a lot better, at least. And there’s no better source for divining exactly what Apple is working on than the patent documents that it publicly files with a government agency. (I mean, we all tell the government exactly what we’re up to, no fibbing, right?)</p>
<p>I can see the skepticism in your eyes, so allow me to banish it to another plane of existence forthwith by running down three recent inventions that the company is—and I can’t stress this highly enough—<em>definitely</em> developing. You be the judge.</p>

    <p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3604/marsedit-4-4-micro-blog-and-performance-improvements">MarsEdit 4.4</a>, MarsEdit 4.4.2 is now available on the <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit site</a> and has been submitted for review on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marsedit-4/id1198319098?mt=12&#038;at=10l4LD">Mac App Store</a>. (If you updated to 4.4.1 previously, 4.4.2 is a quick fix to address a crash in that release.)</p>
<p>This update addresses a few annoying issues that cropped up in the 4.4 release, as well as some other issues that I had been working on fixes for after the 4.4 release was completed.</p>
<p>Complete list of changes for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug that prevented changes like setting categories from working when editing an existing WordPress post</li>
<li>Fix a performance issue that could occur when publishing to a blog with a large number of posts</li>
<li>Fix a bug from 4.4 that caused all blogs to show a disclosure triangle even if they don&#8217;t support Page entries</li>
<li>Fix a bug from 4.4 that caused Movable Type tags and slug values to not be displayed</li>
<li>Fix a crash when uploading images to a blog where authentication is requested</li>
</ul>

    <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/31/liability-shield-congress-bailout/">This is good news, I suppose:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House is <strong>willing to cut a deal with Democrats that leaves out Senate Republican legislation aimed at protecting employers, hospitals and schools from coronavirus-related lawsuits,</strong> according to two people with knowledge of internal White House planning&#8230;.One of the people familiar with the administration’s thinking said the measure was “considered important but not absolutely essential.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mitch McConnell probably could have gotten his liability shield if he had been more reasonable. There&#8217;s a case to be made for some kind of modest &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; legislation, after all. But McConnell wouldn&#8217;t go there. Instead he insisted on a shield so strong it would have protected businesses even from the most egregious negligence. Even the Trump White House was able to see what a political loser this was.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s get to work on extending unemployment benefits, shall we?</p>

    <p>One of these quarters, Apple’s going to announce financial results that don’t result in some sort of record. Perhaps as soon as next quarter, even. But on Thursday, Apple announced the r<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569368/apple-shrugs-off-covid-19-with-record-quarter-boosted-by-sales-of-basically-everything.html">esults of its financial third quarter of 2020</a>—and they were an all-time third quarter record. Literally every measurable category went up, year over year. It was so sunny a set of results that Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed almost embarrassed to be reporting such huge growth amid a global pandemic and some powerful social upheaval in the United States.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s what I gleaned from the results and Apple’s regular post-results conference call with analysts that might provide some insight about where Apple is and where it might be going next.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569430/for-once-the-mac-and-ipad-lead-apples-record-financial-results.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

<p>The GOP is not the party of the working class. Not even of just the white working class. It’s not the party of workers at all. It’s the party of bosses. It’s the party of <em>putting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to work</em> on <em>their</em> terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an interview on CNBC, Mnuchin said he favors extending enhanced unemployment benefits beyond their scheduled July 31 expiration, but he said any extension must protect both employers and employees.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories of where companies are trying to get people back to work and they won’t come because the enhanced unemployment,” Mnuchin said. “But we’ll fix that and we’ll figure out an extension to it that works for companies and works for those people who will still be unemployed.”</p>
<p>Said Mnuchin: “We’re going to make sure that people are incented to go back to jobs.”</p>

<p>I’ve heard stories of people not wanting to come back to work because they’re naturally “incented” to not risk getting sick and dying in a pandemic that’s still out of control. But YMMV.</p>

<p>DeVos’ mission is to destroy public schools and make college unaffordable for the poor and working and lower middle classes. It’s part and parcel with the Republican corporatist plan to create and control a class of desperate and optionless laborers who will take any job at whatever pay the owners chose to pay them and stay on the jobs without question or complaint because there’s nothing else out there but poverty. Only the already well-off are supposed to go to the better colleges and universities, can have educations that will carry them into the ruling elite. Only the upper middle class are allowed educations that will, with luck, keep them, anxiously, upper middle class. The others, disproportionately people of color, will attend poor schools, underfunded and overcrowded, without resources or adequate supplies and up to date textbooks, where they will learn at best to read, write, and do simple math, enough to make them employable, useful, usable.</p>
<p>Just got to thinking as I was reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made clear on Sunday she wants schools to reopen fully for most students for the 2020-21 academic year, even as coronavirus infection rates are soaring in some parts of the country and some superintendents say it is impossible for them to do that.</p>
<p>DeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN’s “State of the Union.” In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. “Kids need to be in school,” she said. “They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can’t — we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening.”</p>
<p>DeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy. In fact, DeVos last week threatened to withhold federal funding from districts that didn’t do what she wanted, even though she can’t unilaterally stop funding approved by Congress.</p>

    <p>Steven Calabresi, in a New York Times op-ed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have voted Republican in every presidential election since 1980,
including voting for Donald Trump in 2016. I wrote op-eds and a
law review article protesting what I believe was an
unconstitutional investigation by Robert Mueller. I also wrote an
op-ed opposing President Trump’s impeachment.</p>

<p>But I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet
seeking to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had
taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that
President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic
and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment
again by the House of Representatives and his removal from
office by the Senate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describing the Federalist Society as conservative and influential is like describing the ocean as large and salty. I truly never thought I’d be able to say I’m in complete agreement with Steven Calabresi, but here we are.</p>

    <p>Todd Haselton, CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple on Thursday announced in its fiscal third-quarter earnings
that the Board of Directors has approved a four-for-one stock
split. Since Apple stock currently trades above $380, it means
investors should expect to again have a chance to buy a share of
Apple for around $100, depending on where the stock trades at the
end of August.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/macjournals/status/1288946809549848578">Matt Deatherage notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve periodically reminded that Apple’s lowest stock price was 23
Dec 1997, when it closed at a currently-adjusted price of $0.40
per share.</p>

<p>After 31 Aug 2020 and the 4:1 split, the new adjusted record low
price on that date will be $0.10/share.</p>

<p>TEN CENTS PER SHARE.</p>

Maestri made it official — the new iPhones won’t ship until
October this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unusual for Apple to say anything about future hardware, but they do like to set accurate expectations, and if they said nothing many would expect new iPhones in September.</p>

    <p>Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2020 third
quarter ended June 27, 2020. The Company posted quarterly revenue
of $59.7 billion, an increase of 11 percent from the year-ago
quarter, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.58, up 18
percent. International sales accounted for 60 percent of the
quarter’s revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A record third quarter — in the midst of a pandemic. Truly hard to believe even knowing that work-from-home has surely led to new hardware purchases.</p>

    <p>John Lewis, in an essay written shortly before his death July 17, to be published on the day of his funeral:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like so many young people today, I was searching for a way out,
or some might say a way in, and then I heard the voice of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio. He was talking about
the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are
all complicit when we tolerate injustice. He said it is not
enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us
has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out.
When you see something that is not right, you must say
something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It
is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build
what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world
society at peace with itself.</p>

<p>Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of
America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.
Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The
vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a
democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed.
You can lose it.</p>

    <p>Daisuke Wakabayashi, Karen Weise, Jack Nicas, and Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A day after lawmakers grilled the chief executives of the biggest
tech companies about their size and power, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet
and Facebook reported surprisingly healthy quarterly financial
results, defying one of the worst economic downturns on record.</p>

<p>Even though the companies felt some sting from the spending
slowdown, they demonstrated, as critics have argued, that they are
operating on a different playing field from the rest of the
economy.</p>

<p>Amazon’s sales were up 40 percent from a year ago and its profit
doubled. Facebook’s profit jumped 98 percent. Even though the
pandemic shuttered many of its stores, Apple increased sales of
all its products in every part of the world and posted $11.25
billion in profit. Advertising revenue dropped for Alphabet, the
laggard of the bunch, but it still did better than Wall Street had
expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was an undercurrent at yesterday’s hearing alleging that these companies, Amazon in particular, were profiteering during the COVID crisis. I don’t think that’s the case. Whatever one’s complaints about any or all of these four companies, they’ve thrived in 2020 because they’re among the few large institutions that have managed the crisis well.</p>

    <p>The president of the United States, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288818160389558273">on, of course, Twitter</a> (random capitalization and frenetic punctuation <em>sic</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is
good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in
history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the
Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-cant-legally-change-the-election-day-but-he-can-try-to-undermine-the-results">Matt Shuham, reporting for TPM, explains the illegality of this notion</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1845, Congress decided that Election Day would be the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. If Trump wants to
change that, he has to convince Congress — a likely impossible
task. And the January Inauguration Day was enshrined in the 20th
Amendment to the Constitution in 1933.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1288835019771990017">Ben Collins</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the biggest litmus test for maintaining democracy we’re
going to get. No pretending you haven’t seen his tweet, no
insisting he’s kidding, no waffling. If you enable the thought of
delaying elections because of rumors and whims, you’re enabling
the end of democracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, it is enormously consequential that the president of the United States would float such an idea — a true and genuine threat to American democracy. But: the system is holding up. Hours after the fact, no Republican has backed Trump’s contemptible spitball, and rather than <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/02/hunt-profiles-in-courage">hide or duck</a>, many have stepped forward to flatly reject it, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html">including the Republican leaders of both the House and Senate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Never in the history of the federal elections have we not held an
election, and we should go forward,” said Representative Kevin
McCarthy, the House minority leader.</p>

<p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, dismissed Mr.
Trump’s suggestion in an interview with WNKY television in Bowling
Green, Ky. “Never in the history of the country, through wars,
depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally
scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again
this Nov. 3,” Mr. McConnell said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tweet is the low point in this whole years-long nightmare of a presidency, and yet simultaneously the <em>reaction</em> to the tweet is the high point. Democracy is the singular most important concept in our society, culture, and Constitution. Everything else, no matter how important, is secondary, insofar as our system of dealing with those issues <em>depends</em> upon democracy through open and fair elections. Civil rights (racial, gender, LGBT), gun rights, judicial nominations, tax rates, military actions, health care, education. Anything and everything enumerated in the Bill of Rights. All of these issues are, no matter what any of us individually feel or think about them, secondary to the conduction of free and fair elections. With this tweet Trump is doing no less than testing the water for ending democracy. It is but a <em>tweet</em>, a word that feels inherently diminutive, but make no mistake, this is the most historically significant and potentially consequential statement Trump has ever made. Rather than walk away from it, he has since <a href="/misc/2020/07/trump-tweet-pinned.png">pinned this one atop</a> the 54,000-tweet stack of abject aggrieved lunacy that is his Twitter history, and reiterated the notion again in a just-completed televised press conference.</p>

<p>It is what until four years ago we would rightly have considered a logical contradiction — a profoundly consequential inanity. A probing hammer tap testing for cracks on the keystone of democratic rule.</p>

<p><em>What must Trump do for his Republican enablers in Congress to abandon him?</em> is <em>the</em> question the rest of us have been asking on a near-daily basis, often in desperation but always in utter exasperation, since before he was even elected. We now seemingly and hopefully have an answer. The line they won’t cross is ending American democracy. History, I firmly believe, will judge Trump’s Republican enablers harshly for not having drawn a line long ago, but this, ultimately, is <em>the</em> singular line that matters. We must now hold our collective breath that they stick to it.</p>

<p>For this, Trump ought be subjected simultaneously to universal contemptuous scorn and gleeful ridicule, more so than for any of his <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-complete-listing-so-far-atrocities-1-796">nearly uncountable</a> contemptible and ridiculous statements and actions of the past. The oath of office to which he swore is to uphold the Constitution. Merely <em>proposing</em> postponing the election makes a mockery of it.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that Trump floated this perverse notion mere moments ahead of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-us-economys-contraction-in-the-second-quarter-was-the-worst-on-record">official confirmation of the obvious</a>: the United States economy has collapsed in historically horrific fashion, and as the economy goes, so go elections. Donald Trump cannot win an honest fair election held 96 days hence, and by law an honest fair election must be held in 96 days.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is, thus, desperate and alone.</p>

<p>I set the odds at 1-in-3 that he drops out of the election before the Republican convention at the end of August. To suggest the election be delayed is an explicit admission that he cannot face his now likely defeat. His deranged mind might plausibly conclude it better — more face-saving to him personally, his only genuine concern — to drop out <em>now</em> on the bullshit claim that the election is “rigged” against him, than lose in a humiliating blowout and cry “rigged” after.</p>

<p>Hope.</p>

    <p>On Apple’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/this-is-tim-apple-q3-2020-results-call-transcript/">quarterly call with analysts</a> Thursday, Apple CFO Luca Maestri made it official — the new iPhones won’t ship until October this year.</p>
<p>Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As you know, last year we started selling the new iPhone in late September. This year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Analyst Jim Suva of Citigroup wasn’t sure he had heard Maestri correctly, so he asked him about it late in the call, and this was Maestri’s response:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I said in my remarks that a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. A few weeks later than late September, or as it’s most commonly called, “October.”</p>

    <p>Robin Givhan, writing for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hearing was billed as an investigation into online
competition. And much of the evidence laid out before Bezos, who
owns The Washington Post, speaks to ruthless business practices.
Zuckerberg still doesn’t quite grasp the impact of Facebook on
civic life. And most of those on the subcommittee weren’t really
up to the task of questioning Cook on Apple’s business practices.
Still, the voices of small-business owners whose livelihoods had
been upended by Amazon were at least piped into the room.</p>

<p>Too many of the Republicans were focused on playing put upon and
abused. They seemed more interested in Trump Jr.’s Twitter habit
and throwing out accusations of anti-Americanism at the only
executive of color testifying. Stifled competition and bullied
employees were side notes. The event was virtual, but the disgrace
was real. The titans were diminished, but far too many of the
subcommittee members were the ones who looked small.</p>
</blockquote>

This is a challenging moment for our communities, and, from Apple’s new $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to a new commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030, we’re living the principle that what we make and do should create opportunity and leave the world better than we found it.”

<p id="p2">Apple has just published its financial results for Q3&nbsp;2020. The company posted revenue of $59.7 billion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/?1596141043" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple CEO Tim Cook said</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  &ldquo;Apple&rsquo;s record June quarter was driven by double-digit growth in both Products and Services and growth in each of our geographic segments,&rdquo; said Tim Cook, Apple&rsquo;s CEO. &ldquo;In uncertain times, this performance is a testament to the important role our products play in our customers&rsquo; lives and to Apple&rsquo;s relentless innovation. This is a challenging moment for our communities, and, from Apple&rsquo;s new $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to a new commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030, we&rsquo;re living the principle that what we make and do should create opportunity and leave the world better than we found it.&rdquo;

<p id="p4">Due to the uncertainty caused by the global pandemic, Apple did not provide financial guidance for Q3&nbsp;2020 during its last earnings call.</p>
<p id="p5">Going into today&rsquo;s call,&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-look-to-hints-of-i-phone-12-delays-in-apples-q-3-2020-earnings-report-151355516.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Finance said that</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Much of the earnings focus, however, will be on whether Cook and company will provide guidance for fiscal Q4, which could offer a hint about any potential delays to the launch of the firm&rsquo;s upcoming iPhone 12.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Despite the lack of guidance, Yahoo Finance says that Bloomberg&rsquo;s research shows that analysts expect the following results:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote8"><p>
  Revenue: $52.2 billion expected versus $53.8 billion in Q3&nbsp;2019.</p>
<p>  Earnings per share: $2.06 expected versus $2.18 in Q3&nbsp;2019.

<p>This post is all about speculative compilation, or just <em>speculation</em> for short, in the context of the JavaScriptCore virtual machine. Speculative compilation is ideal for making dynamic languages, or any language with enough dynamic features, run faster. In this post, we will look at speculation for JavaScript. Historically, this technique or closely related variants has been applied successfully to <a href="https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/pics.pdf">Smalltalk</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/74878.74884">Self</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c313/f6e9f557eccc0702301f629d6c7f1317e20e.pdf">Java</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr">.NET</a>, <a href="https://www.pypy.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby">Ruby</a>, among others. Starting in the 90&rsquo;s, intense benchmark-driven competition between many Java implementations helped to create an understanding of how to build speculative compilers for languages with small amounts of dynamism. Despite being a lot more dynamic than Java, the JavaScript performance war <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/">that started in the naughts</a> has generally favored <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2010/12/new-crankshaft-for-v8.html">increasingly</a> <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/3362/introducing-the-webkit-ftl-jit/">aggressive</a> applications of the same speculative compilation tricks that worked great for Java. It seems like speculation can be applied to any language implementation that uses runtime checks that are hard to reason about statically.</p>

<p>According to figures obtained by the BBC, of the 83 million people in Germany, only around 16 million have downloaded this app since it launched in June. That&rsquo;s less than 20% of the whole population, and probably around a quarter of all smartphone users. Its adoption has been far below the percentages envisaged by those modelling the benefits of such apps, which normally start to become significant once adoption exceeds 50% and rises towards 80%.</p>
<p>Because the German app has respected data privacy, Public Health authorities have gained almost no information about Covid-19 outbreaks from the app. They know that about 500 users of the app have tested positive &#x2013; that&rsquo;s an insignificant proportion &#x2013; and no one can find out how many contacts have been successfully traced as a result. There is also no record of how many exposures resulted in false alarms, nor of missed diagnoses. There are similar problems with Switzerland&rsquo;s app, and a lack of data for Ireland&rsquo;s too.</p>
<p>Adoption of smartphone contact tracing apps has also been very poor in Japan (6% of the population), Italy (7%), and France (3%). To date, no national smartphone contact tracing app has been demonstrated to have had any significant benefit in controlling outbreaks, or significantly reducing the incidence of Covid-19. Only draconian access to personal data, as used in South Korea, seems to have brought any positive results.</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/find-every-number-in-a-long-document-and-divide-it-by-2/18947/">This question</a> on the Keyboard Maestro forum—to which I gave an excessively complicated Perl-based answer because I don’t know nearly enough about Keyboard Maestro’s native features—got me thinking about the best regular expression for matching numbers in a block of text. It’s surprisingly tricky, but I think I have a decent answer.</p>
<p>First, let’s define what we’re looking for. The goal is to find both integers and numbers with a decimal point. They can be positive or negative, but we’re excluding numbers written in exponential notation. So all these should match</p>
<pre><code>123  -123  +123  1.23  -1.23  +1.23
.123 -.123 +.123 123. -123.  +123.
</code></pre>
<p>but these shouldn’t</p>
<pre><code>1.23e4  -1.23e4  1.23e-4  1.23e+4
</code></pre>
<p>(We might want to extend our regex to include exponential notation, but first things first.)</p>
<p>This very simple regex,</p>
<pre><code>[-+.\d]+
</code></pre>
<p>will match numbers, but it’s too permissive. It will match things like <code>3-5</code>, which clearly isn’t right. A more complicated regex</p>
<pre><code>[-+]?\d*\.?\d*
</code></pre>
<p>looks better because it won’t match a hyphen or plus sign between digits, but because <em>everything</em> is optional, it will match empty strings. It would also match periods by themselves and other non-numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/floatingpoint.html">This page</a> suggests the following:</p>
<pre><code>[-+]\d*\.?\d+
</code></pre>
<p>where the + at the end forces there to be at least one digit in the match. This is pretty good, but if you give it <code>123.</code>, it only matches the <code>123</code> part. This may or may not be a mistake, depending on the context.</p>
<p>For example in the Keyboard Maestro forum question, the numbers that were being hunted were attributes of XML tags and were inside double quotation marks. In that situation, a regex of</p>
<pre><code>"[-+]\d*\.?\d+"
</code></pre>
<p>would not find the quoted number in</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tag attribute="123."&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>when it clearly should.</p>
<p>After some experimenting and benchmarking, I’ve settled on</p>
<pre><code>[-+]?(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)
</code></pre>
<p>The optional sign part is obvious. The rest consists of two alternatives. The first,</p>
<pre><code>\d+\.?\d*
</code></pre>
<p>which will match integers, decimals that have one or more leading digits, and the <code>123.</code> case we just talked about. The second alternative,</p>
<pre><code>\.\d+
</code></pre>
<p>handles decimal numbers that don’t have a leading digit.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>"([-+]?(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+))"
</code></pre>
<p>would find the number in</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tag attribute="123."&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and put it in the first capture string, which is accessed via <code>$1</code> or <code>\1</code> in most languages and by <code>Match.group(1)</code> in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">Python</a>.</p>
<p>This regex isn’t a panacea. Remember that <code>3-5</code> example from before? Suppose we had text that included the sentence</p>
<pre><code>The material is found in Chapters 3-5.
</code></pre>
<p>Using</p>
<pre><code>[-+]?(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)
</code></pre>
<p>would return two matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>3</code></li>
<li><code>-5.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first match is correct, but the second is terrible. You might argue that using a hyphen for a range is just wrong (it should be an n-dash), but we don’t always have the luxury of working with text from people who are as meticulous as we are. And even if the hyphen were replaced by an n-dash, we’d still have the period being treated as a decimal point.</p>
<p>While a universal regex may be impossible, that doesn’t mean we can’t come up with one that works in a particular situation. In most cases, we can use either delimiters (like quotation marks) or other clues to put together a regex that finds everything we want without finding the things we don’t want. What’s important is to have a toolbox of regex pieces that we can put together to solve the problem at hand.</p>

    <p>The more we learn about COVID-19, the worse it gets. This is from a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916">recent study of recovered patients in Germany:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CMR [cardiovascular magnetic resonance] revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and <strong>ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%),</strong> independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of patients, even those with no preexisting conditions, developed myocarditis! Now, myocarditis is not always serious, but it can be. Sometimes it lasts a few hours, other times a few months. But why is a respiratory virus causing heart problems? <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/magazine/covid-body?fbclid=IwAR3TzLPQIICW-B-BU0kyqmCBjhQf9u2qtVb1S-65SzxFRpv_dYL9gArZ7E8">The good folks at UCSF magazine explain:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We Thought It Was Just a Respiratory Virus</strong><br />
<strong>We were wrong.</strong></p>
<p>By the luck of the evolutionary draw, <strong>[the coronavirus can] easily grab hold of protein gates on human cells known as ACE2 receptors and, like jackknives, pry these gates open</strong>&#8230;.“You can think of an ACE2 receptor like a docking site,” says Faranak Fattahi, PhD, a UCSF Sandler Fellow.</p>
<p>&#8230;.It stands to reason that SARS-CoV-2 affects the heart. After all, <strong>heart cells are flush with ACE2 receptors,</strong> the virus’s vital port of entry. And, indeed, laboratory experiments suggest that the virus can enter and replicate in cultured human heart cells, says Bruce Conklin, MD, a professor of medicine and an expert in heart-disease genetics at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, along with interactions from the immune system, appears to be responsible for many of the non-respiratory effects we&#8217;ve started seeing in COVID-19 patients. That&#8217;s why, increasingly, it&#8217;s not just important to get COVID-19 deaths down. We need to crush the case count too because even seemingly asymptomatic cases can sometimes cause serious problems down the line.</p>

So I&#8217;ve had Leathermans for many, many years. The Wave, the Wingman, the Sidekick, but recently I picked up my favorite of them and so far, the Leatherman Free P4. The great thing about this is it&#8217;s the first Leatherman that has entirely one-handed tool opening for all the tools. So, quick out and I&#8217;ve got my pliers. So if I&#8217;m working on something I don&#8217;t have to worry about letting go of it and opening up my my pliers. I can also pretty easily one-hand close. All of the tools are accessible like that too. So if I need a screwdriver, I can get to my screwdrivers, all with one hand.</p>

<p><strong>Reinforcing Wires Attached to Tiny Connectors</strong></p>

<p>I sometimes have a devil of a time unplugging the 2- and 3-pin JST connectors on small, heavily-populated printed circuit boards. It’s hard not to pull on the wires as you try and claw the connector out. Years ago, I asked my friend <strong>John Park</strong> if he had any suggestions and he offered: “Hit the wire/connector intersection with hot glue to help provide a stronger connection.” Great idea! If you do this, make sure to go easy on the hot-melt. Since things are so tight, you don’t want to add to the bulk of the connector which might make it harder to get your fingernails or pliers in there for a decent tug. Trivia bonus: Do you know what “JST” stands for? Japan Solderless Terminals.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-advance-estimate-and-annual-update">GDP plummeted 9.5 percent in the second quarter of the year,</a> an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. Just in case that&#8217;s not dramatic enough for you, here&#8217;s a view of GDP that you don&#8217;t normally see:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856040"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1269px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856040" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_gdp_2q_2020.gif" alt="" width="1269" height="615"></figure>
<p>The reason you seldom see this view of raw GDP is that even big drops barely show up. The 1980 recession is hardly visible and even the 2008 Great Recession looks pretty puny. It&#8217;s just a nice, steady march of trendline growth until 2020. The coronavirus recession is the first in 90 years to be so big that it&#8217;s visible from outer space, so to speak.</p>
<p>I used to take solace from the fact that this drop was deliberately manufactured, which meant it could be deliberately remedied when the coronavirus was under control. Little did I know that our president had no real interest in controlling the virus and Republicans had no real interest in keeping the country afloat in the meantime. There is going to be tremendous suffering over the next year.</p>

<p id="p2">When I imagine the quintessential RSS user, I think of someone who wants full control of their web reading experience. They don&rsquo;t want to leave news curation up to an algorithmic service like Apple News, or a social media platform like Twitter or Facebook. They also care about tools like filtering controls, and tweaking the reading experience to their preferences. For such a user, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiery-feeds-rss-reader/id1158763303?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiery Feeds</a> may be a natural choice due to its abundance of supported RSS services and settings to tweak, along with some key pro features. Today, Fiery Feeds is better prepared to meet the needs of that kind of user thanks to a pair of important additions: full-text search and saved searches. Throw in optimized iPad pointer support, plus a new native article rendering option, and the latest Fiery Feeds update is a compelling one.</p>
<p id="p3"><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="search-improvements">Search Improvements</h2>
<p id="p4">Saved searches are a feature commonly found in Mac apps but rarely their iOS and iPadOS counterparts. Fortunately, Fiery Feeds is the latest exception to this trend, debuting a new saved search option that&rsquo;s available even on mobile-first platforms. Saved searches can be created with a simple tap on the plus button that appears any time a search is initiated, and they appear in your feed list in a dedicated section.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/31711bf7-72ce-4a91-b135-595e47b70cba.png" alt="Creating a saved search."><p class="image-caption">Creating a saved search.</p></div>
<p id="p6">Saved searches would be pretty pointless were it not for another key addition to this release: full-text search. You can now enter any search term to have Fiery Feeds scan not only the title but also the body of every link in your feeds, surfacing matching articles from the flood of all your subscriptions. Full-text search and the ability to save searches seem like features designed with my &ldquo;quintessential RSS user&rdquo; in mind: they provide even more nuanced content controls than ever before, so you can spend your time viewing exactly the content you want.</p>
<h2 id="ipad-pointer-support">iPad Pointer Support</h2>
<p id="p7">On the iPad, today&rsquo;s update brings full support for iPadOS&rsquo; pointer. When you have a trackpad or mouse connected to your iPad, the pointer will adapt to different interface elements in Fiery Feeds. It will snap to buttons so you can click them more easily, morph into a text input line in search boxes, let you right-click items in your feed list or article list to open context menus, and the pointer will even highlight feeds or articles it&rsquo;s hovering over. Most of this is standard protocol for pointer-optimized iPad apps, with the sole exception of the hovering behavior.</p>
<p id="p8">When I first started using the iPad&rsquo;s pointer in iPadOS 13.4, I occasionally found that certain interface elements I&rsquo;d expected to react with a highlighting or dimming effect when I hovered over them offered no such response; notes in a note list, for example, or folders in a folder list. Apple set the standard for this behavior and third-party apps have mostly followed suit. Fiery Feeds does things differently, however, causing cells in your feed list and article list to change color shades in response to the pointer&rsquo;s presence. While it&rsquo;s been interesting seeing an implementation that more closely models what I originally expected, the app has confirmed for me that I think Apple made the right call in limiting the pointer&rsquo;s visual activity. I&rsquo;ve found the extra visual cue more distracting than helpful in use, and wish there was an option to disable it. Ultimately though, I think it&rsquo;s a matter of personal taste, and some users may find Fiery Feeds&rsquo; approach exactly what they&rsquo;ve been looking for from the iPad&rsquo;s pointer.</p>
<h2 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h2>
<p id="p9"><strong>Native article rendering.</strong> Fiery Feeds&rsquo; developer Lukas Burgstaller has built a native rendering system that parses a site&rsquo;s HTML itself and uses native OS elements like UIImages and UILabels to display an article&rsquo;s content. I prefer viewing articles with their source site&rsquo;s design retained, so this doesn&rsquo;t impact me personally, but for those who prefer the app&rsquo;s uniform layout for articles&rsquo; content, this change should result in improved performance.</p>
<p id="p10"><strong>Search in settings.</strong> One of my favorite details about Fiery Feeds is how customizable it is. This means the app, by necessity, has a big and complex settings screen, and before now it was easy to get a little lost in there. Now, there&rsquo;s a search box in settings to help you quickly find the function you&rsquo;re looking to tweak.</p>
<hr id="hr11"><p id="p12">None of today&rsquo;s changes to Fiery Feeds are revolutionary, but they do make the app tangibly better in key ways. Full-text search and saved searches can be extremely valuable tools, especially for users who subscribe to a lot of feeds. I&rsquo;ve praised the app before for its three-column layout on iPad, so it&rsquo;s great to see pointer support keep that iPad app current with modern technologies. And the miscellaneous improvements, including a fundamental change in how articles are rendered, are welcome too.</p>
<p id="p13">Fiery Feeds is available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiery-feeds-rss-reader/id1158763303?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the App Store</a> as a free download, with an optional Premium subscription to unlock advanced features such as the new saved searches and full-text search.</p>

    <p class="">There have been a lot of rumors about delays with the new iPhones this year, most recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347232/qualcomm-iphone-delay-hint-rumor-q3-2020-earnings-5g" target="_blank"><span>from Qualcomm</span></a>. If there was ever a year for Apple to get a pass on shipping the iPhone promptly in September, it’s this one.</p><p class="">The question that occurs to me, however, is if there is a delay in hardware, will that also result in a delay in software? In years past, Apple has released the iOS update shortly before the release of new hardware. When I say “shortly,” I’m talking days, not weeks. If the rumors are correct, we are looking at a delay in shipping the new iPhone of a month or possibly more. I can’t help wonder if that will mean a delay in shipping iOS 14 and iPad OS 14 too. If I had to place a bet, I would say they will.</p><p class="">Technically, there’s no reason not to release it early. Throughout the beta period, a lot of us have been running iOS 14 on older generation hardware, and there is no reason technically why they couldn’t just let the older phones have the update a month early.</p><p class="">But there are several good arguments against this. First, over the last few years Apple has had some pretty rocky iOS launches. Why not take an extra month to add some extra spit and polish so that the released version is all the more stable? Second, I always feel like I get a new phone when I install a new operating system. I’m sure for many people who would consider buying the new phone, after spending a month with iOS 14, they may not be as inclined to buy a new phone when it eventually arrives. Lastly, every year Apple holds a bunch of code out of its beta versions of the new operating system. The final version includes additional references, code, and sometimes even apps specific to the new iPhone. If they release the final version, I guarantee you that smart folks all over the planet will take it apart and figure out even more details of the new iPhone before Apple wants you to hear about them.</p><p class="">While Apple may release iOS 14 much earlier than the new phones, I would be surprised if they do.</p>

If you&#8217;re interested, you can subscribe <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/newsletter/">here</a>. The same page has links to subscribe to the blog via RSS or email.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to hear from me daily rather than monthly, here is a list of my <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/twitter_page/">Twitter accounts</a>.</p>
