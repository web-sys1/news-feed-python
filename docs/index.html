    <p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, in a letter to Apple on June 30:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please confirm within two weeks if Apple agrees in principle to
allow Epic to provide a competing app store and competing payment
processing, in which case we will meet with your team to work out
the details including Epic’s firm commitment to utilize any such
features diligently to protect device security, customer privacy,
and a high-quality user experience. If we do not receive your
confirmation, we will understand that Apple is not willing to
make the changes necessary to allow us to provide Android
customers with the option of choosing their app store and payment
processing system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard to believe Apple didn’t go for this. Such careful copy-and-pasting makes for such a compelling argument.</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088">The WordPress founder says</a> the company has been unable to update its iOS app until it gives Apple a cut of its in-app purchases.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one small detail worth knowing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396316/apple-wordpress-in-app-purchase-tax-update-store">Sean Hollister at The Verge:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Here’s the thing: the WordPress app on iOS doesn’t sell anything. I just checked, and so did Stratechery’s Ben Thompson. The app simply lets you make a website for free. There isn’t even an option to buy a unique dot-com or even dot-blog domain name from the iPhone and iPad app — it simply assigns you a free WordPress domain name and 3GB of space.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is either a pretty ill-timed mistake from Apple, or whatever is going on with the App Store folks over there is way more out of hand than we knew. I hope it is the former, but given the incidents of the last few weeks, I think it&#8217;s harder than ever to give Apple the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<p>Apple is making the argument that the App Store is more than a marketplace, that it&rsquo;s inseparable with offering SDKs and developer tools like TestFlight, ARKit, and even stickers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether there was an internal change in the last 18 months or if the mask has simply slipped, but Apple has made a lot of official statements lately that are really tone-deaf from the perspective of a developer. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand or value our contributions or remember that apps existed before the App Store.</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that Apple has privately <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/30/apple-developers-equally/">granted these terms to Amazon</a>, in order to attract Prime Video to its platform.

Hank Johnson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBFDQvIrWYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4601">asked</a> Apple CEO Tim Cook whether the terms between Apple and Amazon are available to other developers. Cook assured the Congressman that they are &ldquo;available to anyone meeting the conditions.&rdquo; Interestingly, at the same hearing, Cook talked about how platforms are in fierce competition for developers.</p><p>So, this week, DCN&rsquo;s CEO Jason Kint, <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DCN-Letter-to-Apple-final.pdf">wrote to Cook</a> to publicly call for the disclosure of the terms of this deal so that &ldquo;anyone meeting the conditions&rdquo; can apply for them. This is a key test for Apple: Will app developers of any size (the ones for which Apple claims to be competing) be able to get the same terms? Did Cook speak the truth before Congress? Will Apple&rsquo;s behavior match its trust-based branding?</p></blockquote>

<p>The secret conditions must have something to do with water. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal">three members</a> of the &ldquo;established&rdquo; program are a river, a canal, and a company headquartered below sea level.</p>

<p>Clearly this must be some kind of mistake. All developers are treated equally by Apple, and no one ever gets to skirt the rules or a better deal &#x2013; at least according to congressional testimony under oath.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s credibility on the fairness of its application of App Store policies is increasingly tattered by cutting special deals like these. It is widely rumoured that a similar agreement existed for Netflix as well.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/epic-games-sought-app-store-side-deal/"><p>According to Apple, Epic Games in June sought a special deal from Apple&rsquo;s Phil Schiller that would change the way in which Epic offers apps on the  App Store. From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/apple-says-epic-games-ceo-wanted-a-side-deal-for-fortnite.html">CNBC</a>:</p><blockquote cite="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/apple-says-epic-games-ceo-wanted-a-side-deal-for-fortnite.html"><p>&ldquo;On June 30, 2020, Epic&rsquo;s CEO Tim Sweeney wrote my colleagues and me an email asking for a &lsquo;side letter&rsquo; from Apple that would create a special deal for only Epic that would fundamentally change the way in which Epic offers apps on Apple&rsquo;s iOS platform,&rdquo; former Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller wrote in a declaration.</p></blockquote><p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney previously said that Epic was not seeking a special deal from Apple and was instead fighting for &ldquo;open platforms and policy changes equally benefiting all developers,&rdquo; but it appears that Epic did attempt to establish a unique relationship with Apple prior to when the lawsuit was filed.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems totally reasonable to ask for a special deal when other companies are clearly getting them (Schiller and Cook statements notwithstanding). Suing for special treatment would look bad, though, so Epic&rsquo;s lawsuit seeks to change the rules for everyone.</p>

<p>Update (2020-08-21): <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1296918541627793411">Tim Sweeney</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1296918541627793411"><p>Apple&rsquo;s statement is misleading. You can read my email in Apple&rsquo;s filing, which is publicly available. I specifically said in Epic&rsquo;s request to the Apple execs, &ldquo;We hope that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers&#8230;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

    <p>This is Stripey pretending to be a lion out on the savannah. It&#8217;s also a good object lesson in the old saying that the best camera is the one you have with you. I didn&#8217;t bring my camera along on this particular day, so I had to shoot this with my cell phone. Is it as good as a picture taken with my usual camera? It&#8217;s better! Because the picture taken with my usual camera doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

    <p>Our beloved postmaster general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/21/us/dnc-convention-election">testified before the Senate today:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We will scour every plant each night leading up to Election Day,”</strong> Mr. DeJoy said in response to a question from Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, as he testified for over two hours before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee&#8230;.“There has been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,” Mr. DeJoy told the lawmakers, adding, <strong>“The Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the caveat that we should all keep a close eye on this stuff over the next couple of months, I think this represents an almost complete victory in the post office wars. It&#8217;s the handling and delivery of mail ballots that&#8217;s always been the biggest issue, not the dismantling of mail sorting machines, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">which has been ongoing for years:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purchased when letters and not packages made up a greater share of postal work, the bulky and aging machines can be expensive to maintain and take up floor space postal leaders say would be better devoted to boxes. Removing underused machines would make the overall system more efficient, postal leaders say. <strong>The USPS has cut back on mail-sorting equipment for years since mail volume began to decline in the 2000s.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 2001 was the peak year for first class mail volume, <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-since-1926.htm">which has declined by nearly half since then:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_860935"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-860935" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_first_class_mail_volume.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="619"></figure>
<p>Ditto for mailboxes, which are routinely removed if daily usage <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-remove-usps-mailboxes/">falls below 25 pieces of mail:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_860909"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1263px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-860909" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_number_mailboxes.gif" alt="" width="1263" height="634"></figure>
<p>The real issue has always been overtime rules and prioritization of mail ballots. A week ago the Postal Service was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">warning 46 states</a> that it couldn&#8217;t guarantee delivery of all mail ballots in time for the November election. If DeJoy is now saying he is &#8220;committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time,&#8221; that represents a major victory for the cause of voting by mail. At this point we just need to make sure he&#8217;s as good as his word.</p>

<p>Technically, it&#8217;s true that existing home sales increased a lot from June to July. But the real story is less dramatic: home sales took a big hit when COVID-19 first hit and then recovered quickly. That might be an interesting story in itself, but it&#8217;s definitely not a story of booming home sales.</p>
<p>As always, beware of headlines that seem too good to be true.</p>

<p class=""> For years now, <a href="https://ulysses.app/promo/macsparky">I've been using Ulysses</a> for all of my serious writing projects, and I'm pleased to have Ulysses back as this week's sponsor. One of the things I like about Ulysses is that despite its many years of development (they recently released version 20), the Ulysses team is always looking for ways to make it better and willing to "go big" with changes if they can help their users with the hard work of writing.   </p><p class="">A great example of this is the recent changes they've made to the outline navigation tools. It has been relocated to the Mac's dashboard, and it's entirely new on iPhone and iPad.   </p><p class="">It's now one view that combines your outline, bookmarks, annotations, and links. I just wrote a lengthy legal document using these tools, and they are a marked improvement over the prior system. You can learn more about this feature over at the Ulysses blog. I'd add that you may want to <a href="https://blog.ulysses.app">keep up with the Ulysses blog</a> since they not only advise on using Ulysses but also offer some great general advice to help make writing easier.  </p><p class="">I'm invested in Ulysses. It just makes writing easier. For so many years, I wrote in apps that were about word processing, not <em>writing</em>. Ulysses is a <em>writing app</em> in every sense of the word. Go check out Ulysses today and start using an app that can help you make your words better. They’ve even got <a href="https://ulysses.app/promo/macsparky">a special offer for MacSparky Readers.</a></p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/ethernet-coax.jpg" /></p><p>I live in a sprawling house, extensively wired with coax cable throughout (but not with Cat 5). My mesh wi-fi works, but with five grownups living and working from home, I wanted a wired connection for the main workstations, teleconferencing spots, and Apple TVs. Re-wiring the house with Cat 5 was intrusive and expensive and the Ethernet over the power line didn&#8217;t work across the isolated circuits.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://geni.us/ethernet-coax">Ethernet-over-coax-cable converters</a>. I plugged one end of it into the coax cable in the basement near my Ethernet switch and the other end into the same cable in my office upstairs and it just worked. The spec says the bandwidth is up to 100Mbs, but I&#8217;m getting close to 200Mbs (which is what I get from my ISP anyway). I now have many of these and I have it for about 5 months and have no issues to report.</p>

    <p>With the economy in shock thanks to COVID-19, the obvious response from the federal government is to spend lots of money to cushion the blow. This would not only help out businesses and individuals—a worthy end in itself—but massive deficit spending would also help kick start the economy as a whole. Still, there&#8217;s a limit to how much we can blow up the deficit. The question is: What is that limit?</p>
<p>The downside of deficit spending is that if you do too much of it you&#8217;ll touch off a surge of inflation. This is what limits our tolerance for deficits when the economy is already in good shape. But what if the economy is in a deep recession? Then we should spend whatever it takes to get the economy fully back on its feet. There&#8217;s no reason to stop until we start to see signs of growing inflation.</p>
<p>So what about now? Obviously we&#8217;re in a deep recession that calls for enormous spending. Nonetheless, we need some touchstone that tells us if spending is out of hand and we&#8217;re running up deficits too quickly. That touchstone is inflationary expectations, and there are lots of ways of estimating it. Here&#8217;s a whole bunch of them. First off is what&#8217;s known as the 5-year/5-year forward inflation expectation rate:</p>

<p>Next up is the 10-year breakeven rate:</p>

<p>Bottom line: Nobody, literally nobody, sees even the slightest inflationary pressure causing a problem over the next ten years. The average forecast for 1-10 years is under 2 percent, about the same as it&#8217;s been for the past decade.</p>
<p>But wait! What if all these forecasts are wrong? Then we&#8217;ll get plenty of warning. Inflationary expectations will rise steadily until they get to a point where policymakers need to start getting worried. Right now, though, we aren&#8217;t within light years of that. With an economy in the doldrums—and a worldwide economy that&#8217;s obviously not going to help us out—we should be spending huge amounts of money and running up the deficit until we get at least a flicker of rising inflation. This is why Fed Chair Jay Powell is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/30/finance-202-federal-reserve-chairman-tells-congress-keep-spending-rescue-economy/">practically begging Congress to spend more money.</a></p>
<p>We need to spend lots of money. We need to run big deficits. It&#8217;s the only way to save the economy, and we shouldn&#8217;t even think about slowing down until inflationary pressures start to seriously rise. That&#8217;s probably at least a year away, maybe more.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><em><strong>Posted Thursday evening, August 20, 2020.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Biden Harris Kamala Harris after her inauguration as SF DA personal photo - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Biden Harris Kamala Harris after her inauguration as SF DA personal photo - Edited" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="color: #737373;">U.S. Senator and Democratic nominee for Vice-President Kamala Harris back on her first day as San Francisco’s District Attorney. She had just been inaugurated and had come into her office to get a feel for it---and to get to work. Personal photo courtesy of Kamala Harris, via the Bemidji Pioneer.</span></h5>
<p>In the video short introducing her at the convention last night, someone close to Kamala Harris described her as “fierce”. I didn’t catch who it was. Her sister? Her best friend? No matter. Someone who knew her growing up. When I heard the word “fierce” I jumped up from my chair. “Yes!” I cried to myself. Fierce is one of the words I’ve been using to describe her on the blog, on Twitter, in analog conversations, from the start. Her ferocity is one of things that drew me to her when she first came to the Senate in 2017 and I saw her at work in Judiciary Committee hearings and then helped make her my first choice for the presidential nomination. It’s what made her my favorite for the VP nod. I think Biden needs her ferocity. He needs her to be fierce on his behalf. And what I like most about her ferocity is how calm she is when she is at her fiercest.</p>
<p>At any rate, in this anecdote from her memoir <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Truths We Hold”</a> she tells a story from when she was a law student interning in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office in California. She describes herself getting what she needed to get done by begging and pleading with the court clerk. But I imagine what moved the clerk to action was that she sensed the ferocity beneath the begging and pleading and knew to get out of the way...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As summer interns, we understandably had very little power or influence. Our job was primarily to learn and observe, while assisting where we could. It was a chance to get a taste of how the criminal justice system worked from the inside, what looked like when justice was served---and when it wasn’t. We were placed with attorneys who were trying all kinds of cases, from DUIs to homicides, and had the chance to be in a room---and part of the process---of putting together a case.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget the time my supervisor was working on a case involving a drug bust. The police had arrested a number of individuals in the raid, including an innocent bystander: a woman who had been at the wrong place at the wrong time and had been swept up in the dragnet. I hadn’t seen her. I didn’t know who she was or what she looked like. I didn’t have any connection to her except the report I was reviewing. But there was something about her that caught my attention.</p>
<p>It was late on a Friday afternoon, and most people had gone home for the weekend. In all likelihood, a judge wouldn’t see her until Monday. That meant she’d have to spend the weekend in jail.</p>
<p><em>Does she work weekends? Is she going to have to explain to her employer where she was? Is she going to get fired?</em></p>
<p>Even more important, I knew she had young children at home. <em>Do they know she’s in jail? They must think she did something wrong. Who’s taking care of them right now? Is there even someone who can? Child Protection might get called. My God, she could lose her kids.</em></p>
<p>Everything was on the line for this woman: her family, her livelihood, her standing in the community, her dignity, her liberty. And yet she’d done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>I rushed to the clerk of the court and asked to have the case called that very day. I begged. I pleaded. If the judge could just return to the bench for five minutes, we could get her released. All I could think about washer family and her frightened children. Finally, as the minutes in the day wound down, the judge returned. I watched and listened as he reviewed her case, waiting for him to give the order. Then with the pound of the gavel, just like that, she was free. She’d get to go home to her children in time for dinner…</p>
<p>It was a defining moment in my life. It was the crystallization of how, even on the margins of the criminal justice system, the stakes were extraordinarily high and intensely human. It was a realization that, even with the limited authority of an intern, people who cared could do justice. It was revelatory, a moment that proved it mattered to have compassionate people working as prosecutors. Years before I would be elected to run a major prosecutor’s office, this was one of the victories that mattered most. I knew she was going home.</p>
<p>And I knew the kind of work I wanted to do and who I wanted to serve.</p>

We have leaders and contributors from a diverse set of different backgrounds and employers, and that diversity is a critical strength. Further, it is a common misconception that all of the Mozilla employees who participated in Rust leadership did so as a part of their employment. In fact, many Mozilla employees in Rust leadership <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1294023260770770944">contributed to Rust in their personal time</a>, not as a part of their job.</p>

<p>[The] Rust Core Team and Mozilla are happy to announce plans to create a Rust foundation. The Rust Core Team&rsquo;s goal is to have the first iteration of the foundation up and running by the end of the year.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>While we have only begun the process of setting up the foundation, over the past two years the Infrastructure Team has been leading the charge to reduce the reliance on any single company sponsoring the project, as well as growing the number of companies that support Rust.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the problem is that all those old APIs are still there in the WWDC videos from last year. But WWDC videos are usually a very good source of knowledge, people come back to them years later looking for information that can&rsquo;t be found in the docs, Apple even often references videos from previous years in new videos, because they naturally can&rsquo;t repeat all information every year.</p>
<p>This was bothering me enough that I decided to spend some time collecting all the major changes in the APIs that were presented in June 2019, but were changed later in one place.</p>

<p>This is an existential threat to indie weather apps. We&rsquo;re now forced to:</p>
<p>A) Find a new provider that&rsquo;s comparable and integrate it instead of Dark Sky.<br />
B) Create a new set of widgets that are at least as good as Apple&rsquo;s (preferably better!)<br />
C) Do all of this in about 3 months.</p>
<p>We also have to learn all the new tech, update our existing app to work with iOS 14, and deal with the fact that this is all beta software that&rsquo;s clunky, poorly documented, and barely works in a bunch of ways.</p>
<p>Oh, and Apple has special access to private APIs that we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was hoping Apple would integrate the Dark Sky features into the iOS 14 API. That would make it easier to develop (if not necessarily to sell) weather apps, as several of them have better interfaces than Apple&rsquo;s own. Instead, they&rsquo;ve improved the built-in app but made things worse for fans of alternate apps.</p>

    <p>A statement by 70 former Republican national security officials:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are former national security officials who served during the
administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush,
George W. Bush, and/or Donald Trump, or as Republican Members of
Congress. We are profoundly concerned about the course of our
nation under the leadership of Donald Trump. Through his actions
and his rhetoric, Trump has demonstrated that he lacks the
character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in
corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as President.</p>

<p>For the following reasons, we have concluded that Donald Trump has
failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be
elected the next President of the United States.</p>

  <p>Among the key findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>That then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort was working with
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/politics/mueller-kilimnik-manafort/index.html">Konstantin Kilimnik</a>, a Russian intelligence officer, and
sought to share internal campaign information with Kilimnik. The
committee says it obtained “some information suggesting Kilimnik
may have been connected” to Russia’s 2016 hacking operation and
concludes Manafort’s role on the campaign “represented a grave
counterintelligence threat.”</p></li>
<li><p>That Trump and senior campaign officials sought to obtain
advance information on WikiLeaks’ email dumps <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks/index.html">through Roger
Stone</a>, and that Trump spoke to Stone about WikiLeaks,
despite telling the special counsel in written answers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/politics/mueller-report-rerelease-fewer-redactions/index.html">he had
“no recollections” that they had spoken about it</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>That information offered at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/politics/trump-tower-meeting-timeline/index.html">the June 2016 Trump Tower
meeting</a> “was part of a broader influence operation” from
the Russian government, though there’s no evidence Trump
campaign members knew of it. Two of the Russians who met with
Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Manafort had “significant
connections” to the Russian government, including Russian
intelligence, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya’s ties
were “far more extensive and concerning than what had been
publicly known.”</p></li>

    <p>David E. Sanger and Julian E. Barnes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/tiktok-security-threat.html">reporting for The New York Times last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok has long presented a parenting problem, as millions of
Americans raising preteens and teenagers distracted by its viral
videos can attest. But when the C.I.A. was asked recently to
assess whether it was also a national security problem, the answer
that came back was highly equivocal.</p>

<p>Yes, the agency’s analysts told the White House, it is possible
that the Chinese intelligence authorities could intercept data or
use the app to bore into smartphones. But there is no evidence
they have done so, despite the calls from President Trump and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to neutralize a threat from the
app’s presence on millions of American devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that TikTok is owned and controlled by a Chinese company is reason enough to be suspicious, and in my opinion <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/18/tiktok-tim-wu">reason enough to ban the service</a>. But there is no evidence to date that TikTok is a security threat in the sense that their app might be doing anything secretly nefarious on our phones. We should be concerned just by what TikTok is doing on the surface, what we see and know TikTok does — its potential as a propaganda arm of the PRC.</p>

<p>In terms of intercepting data it shouldn’t have access to, there’s no sign TikTok has ever done so and there’s no reason to think they <em>could</em> even if they wanted to. All iOS and Google Play Android apps are installed in sandboxes — no app, TikTok or otherwise, has access to data outside its sandbox. <em>Sandbox</em> is arguably a poorly-chosen word from a layperson’s perspective. It’s nothing like a real-world playground where kids can, if unsupervised, freely move from one sandbox to another (or throw sand outside their own sandbox). <a href="https://cocoacasts.com/what-is-application-sandboxing/">An application sandbox is like a virtual world unto itself</a>. They’re implemented technically, not through voluntary compliance. They are technical containers that limit what an app <em>can</em> see and do, not a list of guidelines of what an app <em>should</em> see and do. An app doing something outside its sandbox — without explicit permission from the platform via an entitlement — is exploiting a security vulnerability, not merely breaking the rules.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s possible that TikTok could be exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS and/or Android to access data they shouldn’t be able to, but there’s never been any suggestion that they are. And if they were, it would be huge news, an enormous scandal both for TikTok <em>and</em> the platform vendor (Apple or Google). Why risk it? TikTok is already sitting on a veritable golden goose, collecting information about what sort of videos hundreds of millions of users around the world enjoy watching, and controlling the secret black-box algorithm that determines what new videos those hundreds of millions of people see each time they open TikTok and swipe up. Even if TikTok’s intentions are truly evil, they’d be fools to risk what they have by exploiting security bugs to, say, try to read emails or texts or whatever people are spooked they’re doing.</p>

<p>Being spooked that TikTok is secretly stealing your emails is like being spooked that the ATMs in a casino are stealing your bank account PIN code. Why in the world would a casino run a crooked ATM when you’re using the ATM to take out money to lose to them in slot machines? It’s theoretically possible but makes little sense.</p>

<p>But what about stories like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/biden-campaign-tiktok/index.html">the Biden campaign banning TikTok from staffers’ phones</a>? Or Amazon’s internal IT department sending out a company-wide blast <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200710/p20#a200710p20">declaring that TikTok must be removed from any device that accesses company email</a>, only to issue a “never mind” retraction hours later? People see these stories and assume TikTok must be doing something nefarious. But I very much suspect that the stories themselves are driven by the general hysteria around TikTok being up to no good.</p>

<p>Organizations like the Biden campaign and Amazon’s IT department are banning TikTok not because they know something is fishy about it but as a sort of “cover your ass just in case” thing. Given <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/john-podesta-pizzagate-766489/">what happened to the Clinton campaign’s email</a> in 2016, you can’t blame the Biden campaign for being overly cautious, if not downright paranoid. I recommend paranoia for them. But I think the reason Amazon so quickly <em>reverted</em> its ban on TikTok was because the initial ban was based on nothing more than hearsay.</p>

<p>Consider Apple and Google. Both companies have an inordinate amount of intellectual property to protect. Both companies are surely deeply concerned about the Chinese government, in particular, attempting to infiltrate their systems. Both companies also have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-brand.html">consumer brand reputations</a> to protect with the App Store and Play Store. If either company had any actual reason to suspect TikTok of malfeasance, they’d remove TikTok from their app stores. Surely, the security experts at both companies have examined TikTok with more attention than most apps get.</p>

<p>And even if they couldn’t prove anything, they’d surely be among the very first companies to ban the TikTok app from employee devices if there were any reason to suspect they should. But they haven’t. Apple and Google employees are free to swipe swipe swipe in TikTok to their hearts’ content on the same devices they use for work communication.</p>

<p>We should be concerned about TikTok only because of what we <em>know</em> they have access to: TikTok users’ attention and their interests. There’s no evidence that TikTok has access to anything else on our phones that they shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Unless I’m missing something, “Beats” is now gone from all of Apple Music. What remains of the Beats brand is only the headphone business, which I expect will fade away in the next few years as the AirPods brand expands.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, English has more than five or ten vowel sounds. The actual number is disputed because of disagreements over when two sounds are sufficiently distinct to be classified as separate sounds. I&#8217;ve heard some people say 15, some 17, some over 20.</p>
<p>I ran across a <a href="https://lingthusiasm.com/post/159237203511/lingthusiasm-episode-6-all-the-sounds-in-all-the">podcast episode</a> recently that mentioned a sentence that demonstrates a different English vowel sound in each word:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Who would know naught of art must learn, act, and then take his ease [1].</p>
<p>The hosts noted that to get all the vowels in, you need to read the sentence with non-rhotic pronunciation, i.e. suppressing the r in <em>art</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll run this sentence through some software that returns the phonetic spelling of each word in IPA symbols to see the distinct vowel sounds that way. First I&#8217;ll use Python, then Mathematica.</p>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s run this through some Python code that converts English words to <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> notation so we can look at the vowels.</p>
<pre>    import eng_to_ipa as ipa

    text = "Who would know naught of art must learn, act, and then take his ease."
    print(ipa.convert(text))
</pre>
<p>This gives us</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">hu wʊd noʊ nɔt əv ɑrt məst lərn, ækt, ənd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz</p>
<p>Which includes the following vowel symbols:</p>
<ol>
<li>u</li>
<li>ʊ</li>
<li>oʊ</li>
<li>ɔ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ɑ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>æ</li>
<li>ə</li>
<li>ɛ</li>
<li>eɪ</li>
<li>ɪ</li>
<li>i</li>
</ol>
<p>This has some duplicates: 5, 7, 8, and 10 are all schwa symbols.</p>
<p>By default the <code>eng_to_ipa</code> gives one way to write each word in IPA notation. There is an optional argument, <code>retrieve_all</code> that defaults to <code>False</code> but may return more alternatives when set to <code>True</code>. However, in our example the only difference is that the second alternative writes <em>and</em> as <code>ænd</code> rather than <code>ənd</code>.</p>
<p>It looks like the <code>eng_to_ipa</code> module doesn&#8217;t transcribe vowels with sufficient resolution to distinguish some of the sounds in the model sequence. For example, it doesn&#8217;t seem to distinguish the stressed sound <code>ʌ</code> from the unstressed <code>ə</code>.</p>
<h2>Mathematica</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s Mathematica code to split the model sentence into words and show the IPA pronunciation of each word.</p>
<pre>    text = "who would know naught of art must \
        learn, act, and then take his ease" 
    ipa[w_] := WordData[w, "PhoneticForm"]
    Map[ipa, TextWords[text]]
</pre>
<p>This returns</p>
<pre>    {"hˈu", "wˈʊd", "nˈoʊ", "nˈɔt", "ˈʌv", "ˈɒrt", "mˈʌst", 
    "lˈɝn", "ˈækt", "ˈænd", "ðˈɛn", "tˈeɪk", "hˈɪz", "ˈiz"}
</pre>
<p>By the way, I had to write the first word as &#8220;who&#8221; because <code>WordData</code> won&#8217;t do it for me. If you ask for</p>
<pre>    ipa["Who"]</pre>
<p>Mathematica will return</p>
<pre>    Missing["NotAvailable"]</pre>
<p>though it works as expected if you send it &#8220;who&#8221; rather than &#8220;Who.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remove the stress marks and join the words together so we can compare the Python and Mathematica output. The top line is from Python and the bottom is from Mathematica.</p>
<pre>    hu wʊd noʊ nɔt əv ɑrt məst lərn ækt ænd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz
    hu wʊd noʊ nɔt ʌv ɒrt mʌst lɝn  ækt ænd ðɛn teɪk hɪz iz
</pre>
<p>There are a few differences, summarized in the table below. Since the symbols are a little difficult to tell apart, I&#8217;ve included their Unicode code points.</p>
<pre>    |-------+------------+-------------|
    | Word  | Python     | Mathematica |
    |-------+------------+-------------|
    | of    | ə (U+0259) | ʌ (U+028C)  |
    | must  | ə (U+0259) | ʌ (U+028C)  |
    | art   | ɑ (U+0251) | ɒ (U+0252)  |
    | learn | ə (U+0259) | ɝ (U+025D)  |
    |-------+------------+-------------|
</pre>
<p>Mathematica makes some distinctions that Python missed.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: See the first comment below for variations on how the model sentence can be pronounced and how to get more distinct vowel sounds out of it.</p>

<p>Here’s a tip I learned from Donald Bell’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJZK2etTZFGXYDh8p3x3w?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Maker Update</a>. It’s from an old DigiKey <a href="https://youtu.be/iHyA4M0A8V4?utm_campaign=Gareth%27s%20Tips%2C%20Tools%2C%20and%20Shop%20Tales&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">“Teaching Moment</a>.” Many barrel jacks have a consistent 5.5mm outside diameter. But the inside diameter can vary, usually either between 2.1mm or 2.5mm. If you don’t have your digital calipers handy, you can determine this inside diameter with common objects: a toothpick, a ball point pen, or a test probe. The brass housing on a ball point pen is usually 2.2mm. If it doesn’t fit inside the barrel of your jack, then the jack is 2.1mm. If the pen easily fits inside, the jack is 2.5mm. A standard toothpick is 2.1mm. If it fits snugly in the jack, it’s a 2.1mm jack. Also, a common multimeter probe needle with fit closely inside of a 2.1mm jack and be very sloppy inside of a 2.5mm jack.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Pomodoro Technique to Fight Distraction</strong><br />

This is a method for trying to focus on the work at hand in our extraordinarily distracted modern world. The basic idea is to set a timer for a set interval of time (say, 25 minutes), come up for air for a set interval (say 10 minutes), set the timer again, rinse, repeat. When under the timer, you do <em>nothing</em> but the work at hand. No checking your phone, email, FaceFart, etc.</p>
<p>I had no idea it had a name, but I’ve used the timer technique for years. Sometimes, it’s the only way I can get anything productive done. I set my timer for 56 minute sessions (don’t ask).</p>
<p>If you have similar distraction issues, consider giving this method a try.</p>

<p><strong>Federal prosecutors in New York on Thursday unsealed criminal charges against Stephen K. Bannon,</strong> President Trump’s former chief strategist, and three other men they alleged defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors using an online crowdfunding campaign that was advertised as raising money to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico&#8230;.<strong>Prosecutors alleged they and two others routed payments from the campaign through the non-profit and another shell company and disguised them with fake invoices to help keep their personal pay secret.</strong> All four were arrested Thursday and are expected to make court appearances later in the day. They are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

    <p class="">I’ve been thinking lately about my journaling workflows. I’m increasingly using digital tools for daily journaling and questioning a lot of assumptions. One of those is about the purpose of journaling my day. Am I doing it to figure out what I was doing at 2:00 p.m. on a given day, or something else? The more I think about it, for me, the answer is something else.</p><p class="">Now I’m looking at my days not in terms of what I was doing at a specific time, but instead what I was doing&nbsp;<em>with my time</em>. I’m usually wearing one of three hats: maker, manager, or consumer.</p><p class=""><strong>The Maker</strong></p><p class="">Whenever I’m adding something, I’m making. I interpret this broadly. Making Field Guides, writing blog posts, doing client work, and making music are examples of things I make. While a lot of the things I make are shared with the world, others aren’t. Whether it’s for others or for me, I’m still making.</p><p class=""><strong>The Manager</strong></p><p class="">For Maker Sparky to produce, Manager Sparky needs to wrangle everything else. This is both an essential support role and an easy trap to fall into.</p><p class=""><strong>The Consumer</strong></p><p class="">When I’m not making or managing, I’m consuming. This ranges from watching <em>Star Wars</em> to reading scholarly articles. It’s all-consuming. This isn’t bad. It’s one of the best ways I come up with ideas for Maker Sparky.</p><p class="">My purpose in journaling is tracking how I’m spending my time in these roles. I don’t view any of them as inherently good or bad. The magic is in the balance. While making is most important to me, both managing and consuming enable making. I want to spend more time making than consuming. I need to spend time managing, but not go down the management/productivity rabbit hole so far that I don’t make anything.</p><p class="">So with this in mind, I’ve been focusing my journaling lately not so much on what I had for lunch, but what I make, manage, and consume. Using tags, I can then see it on a daily, weekly, and even monthly basis. If I look at my week and realize I spent most of my time sharpening pencils and sorting tasks (manager) and not enough time producing content (maker), I know I need to make changes. You can get similar information by tracking your time, but I think there is something more concrete looking at a list of things you’ve made, managed, and consumed over a period of time.</p><p class="">Implementing this isn’t difficult. You could create a text file and start making a list. You can do the same thing with a pad of paper and a pencil, or, if you’re using a digital journal like Day One, add tags for #maker, #manager, and #consumer. The real benefit of this comes in planning and review. If you’re going to track yourself as a maker, manager, and consumer, you should have some expectations and a feedback mechanism for living up to them.</p>

<p>For close to four years now, he’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. <strong>170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.</strong></p>

    <p class=""><a href="https://setapp.com/"><span>Setapp, the app subscription service for Mac Apps</span></a>, is no longer just for Mac Apps. Last week Setapp announced that it has added seven iOS apps to the service including Ulysses, Paste, Gemini Photos, Taskheal, SQLPro Studio, Mind Node, and PDF Search with more to come in the future. </p><p class="">I have several developer friends with Apps in Setapp and I never hear the usual grumbling from them about not getting enough revenue share from the service. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. So it’s good knowing they are taking care fo the developers and as a user, I dig the service because they just keep finding more apps that I like and would never have found otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p class=""> </p>

<p>Note that with an Apple Silicon Mac, unsigned software won&rsquo;t run at all. You can sign it without needing a developer account, but you can&rsquo;t notarize it, so it will be treated to these dialogs.</p>

<p>New in macOS 11 on Apple silicon Mac computers, and starting in the next macOS Big Sur 11 beta, the operating system will enforce that any executable must be signed with a valid signature before it&rsquo;s allowed to run. There isn&rsquo;t a specific identity requirement for this signature: a simple ad-hoc signature issued locally is sufficient, which includes signatures which are now generated automatically by the linker. This new behavior doesn&rsquo;t change the long-established policy that our users and developers can run arbitrary code on their Macs, and is designed to simplify the execution policies on Apple silicon Mac computers and enable the system to better detect code modifications.</p>
<p>This new policy doesn&rsquo;t apply to translated x86 binaries running under Rosetta, nor does it apply to macOS 11 running on Intel platforms.</p>

<p>While Englebart came up with the idea for the mouse, it was English who built it out of wood, electrical switches, and metal wheels in 1963.

It’s a free Mac utility that lets you put more or less anything you want in your menu bar. I keep finding more uses for it—at this point I’ve got four separate BitBar items in my menu bar.</p>
<p>At its simplest, BitBar is an app that runs plug-ins that display information in your menu bar. (It’s named because it was initially built to display Bitcoin prices.) There’s a whole collection of plug-ins at <a href="http://getbitbar.com">getbitbar.com</a>, so if you’re not comfortable writing your own, you might find exactly what you want. It’s also easy to modify existing plugins to do what you want—all a BitBar plugin is, is a script that runs, gets data, and then returns a value that is displayed in the menu bar.</p>
<p>Last week a friend of mine upgraded to Catalina and, in the process, lost an old Mac utility he used to display the currently playing track in iTunes/Apple Music. I suggested he look at BitBar, which has a <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Music/music.10s.sh">plugin that does just that</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that while it worked, BitBar’s plugin didn’t do exactly what he wanted. Most notably, he wanted the current track to be displayed in the format <code>Song Title - Album (Year) - Artist</code>. Since this particular plugin was a shell script, I was able to open it in BBEdit and quickly <a href="https://pastebin.com/UfBX9H4k">customize it</a> to meet his needs.</p>
<p>For example, the existing music plug-in didn’t display the year, but I was able to include a little bit of inline AppleScript within the shell script that did the trick:</p>
<pre><code>year=$(osascript -e'
set theYear to "0"
tell application "Music"
    try
        set theYear to (year of current track as string)
    on error errText
        ""
    end try
end tell
if theYear = "0" then
    return ""
else
    return ("(" &amp; theYear &amp; ")")
end if
');
</code></pre>
<p>I also ripped out a bunch of features that my friend didn’t really want, like play/pause/next/previous controls and a bunch of metadata in the dropdown menu. (Yes, BitBar will let you not just create custom text in the menu bar, but in the items that display when you click on the menu bar item.)</p>
<p>Last week Dan Moren updated a plug-in that I wrote a while back that looks at the live-stream servers of our various podcast networks and displays the current number of listeners in the menu bar. (He re-wrote the thing in PHP, since that’s a language he’s comfortable with.)</p>
<p>I’ve also got the current temperature from my weather station in my menu bar thanks to BitBar. Since I was more comfortable writing in AppleScript than in a shell script, my weather “plugin” is a single line – <code>osascript ~/weatherscript.scpt</code> – that runs a small AppleScript script that queries my weather station and returns the current temperature data, which BitBar displays.</p>
<p>Finally, I use a tiny plugin that pings my Linode server and reports back the total ping time, which is useful in determining at a glance if I’m really having network issues or if it’s just my imagination.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable in literally any scripting language that can execute on your Mac, you can build BitBar plugins to display anything you can think of in your menu bar.</p>

<p><strong>Betsy Delph</strong> is a classically trained chef who manages the kitchen for an outdoor science school, has spent six years as a wilderness fire lookout for the US Forest Service, and is a <a href="https://www.alidadeforesttherapy.com/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">forest therapy/shinrin yoku guide</a>.

<p><strong>About the bag</strong></p>
<p>The bag is a <a href="https://geni.us/pJRt?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Rite in the Rain Side-Bound Notebook Cover</strong></a>. It fits a plethora of things and it’s only 5.5&#8243; x 8.5&#8243;. It’s made of Cordura, so it’s super-tough and has just enough structure to protect my brushes, palettes, and paper from the inside of my backpack.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s inside the bag</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://art-toolkit.com/products/palettes/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>The Pocket Palettes by Art Toolkit</strong></a> are simply phenomenal. They’re compact, with a mixing palette, and various sizes of magnetic pans so you can create your own custom selection of color. They also make pre-filled palettes to give you a jump start.</p>
<p>I filled my pans with <a href="http://danielsmith.com/daniel-smith-essentials-watercolor-5ml-set-6-colors/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Daniel Smith Watercolors</strong></a>. They have more than 250 colors, which is enough to bend your brain. I started with their Essentials Set and picked up one of their Dot Cards so I could test-drive some of the colors my favorite artists use before picking some more to buy…I’m up to 34 colors now.</p>
<p>I started off with travel brushes that have a little water well in the handle, but I didn’t like how I couldn’t control the flow very well, and pretty much used them like normal brushes. So I upgraded to still <a href="https://geni.us/N8R1L6e?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>very affordable synthetic sable travel brushes</strong></a>. My prize one is real sable, from <a href="https://www.rosemaryandco.com/watercolour-brushes?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Rosemary &amp; Co</a>, but the set from Amazon is great and 3 brushes cost as much as the single nicer one.</p>
<p>I like to use <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/products/fluid-100-watercolor-paper-blocks/?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>watercolor blocks of various sizes</strong></a>. The pages are glued together in a “block”, which means the paper stays flat without having to tape it down. Fluid Watercolor Blocks are a good value and quality, and come in a wide array of sizes. One of the 4&#8243; x 6&#8243; blocks fits right in the bag, or I’ll carry a bigger one along with it.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t really care much about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/19/apple-2-trillion/">this sort of story,</a> but it is wild to think about how far the company has come since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Performa">the dark days.</a></p>

    <p class="">I was recently reading&nbsp;<a href="https://benjaminhardy.com/10-reasons-you-should-wake-up-at-5am-for-30-days-straight/" target="_blank"><span>Benjamin Hardy’s article</span></a>&nbsp;about waking up early. He makes many good points, but I can’t help think he is missing a huge caveat. While waking up early&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;help you, not getting enough sleep&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;wreck you.<br><br>Not getting enough sleep&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body" target="_blank"><span>messes with your body in so many ways</span></a>. Memory issues, trouble concentrating, mood changes, weight gain, and balance issues are just the start of the list. Not getting enough sleep also lowers your libido. We’re talking less sex, people! Seriously, a doctor friend once explained it to me simply: “Not getting enough sleep is like operating the human body while intoxicated.”<br><br>I’m all for playing with your schedule. If you need to get up at 3:00 a.m. to be the best you, then absolutely do it. But if you think you can do that without getting enough sleep, you’re kidding yourself.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2016/01/scoop.jpg" /></p><p>The little plastic cat litter scoop I&#8217;d been using for a couple of years had gotten flimsy from use and would often buckle at the handle. The <a href="https://geni.us/dura-scoop">DuraScoop</a> is made from cast aluminum and will never bend. It easily shaves hardened clumps of litter from that litter box that would cause a plastic scoop to fold in half. It&#8217;s actually a beautiful looking tool, too. If Raymond Loewy designed a scoop, it would look like this (maybe the handle wouldn&#8217;t be covered with textured plastic). Cleaning cat litter is an unpleasant daily chore for me, but the DuraScoop makes it much less unpleasant.</p>

    <p>David Shayer, in a rather incredible story for TidBITS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing
code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of
iPod Software — my boss’s boss — abruptly entered and closed the
door behind him. He cut to the chase. “I have a special assignment
for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two
engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod.
Report only to me.”</p>

<p>The next day, the receptionist called to tell me that two men were
waiting in the lobby. I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew,
the engineers who would actually build this custom iPod. I’d love
to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats and were glancing
in window reflections to make sure they hadn’t been tailed, but
they were perfectly normal thirty-something engineers. I signed
them in, and we went to a conference room to talk.</p>

<p>They didn’t actually work for the Department of Energy; they
worked for a division of Bechtel, a large US defense contractor to
the Department of Energy. They wanted to add some custom hardware
to an iPod and record data from this custom hardware to the iPod’s
disk in a way that couldn’t be easily detected. But it still had
to look and work like a normal iPod.</p>

<p>They’d do all the work. My job was to provide any help they needed
from Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a wild story. <a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1295727727606104064">Tony Fadell, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project was real w/o a doubt.</p>

<p>There was whole surreal drama and interesting story about how this
project was kicked off and then kept secret.</p>
