    <p>Lauren Feiner, reporting for CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uber would likely shut down temporarily for several months if a
court does not overturn a recent ruling requiring it to classify
its drivers as full-time employees, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in
an interview with Stephanie Ruhle Wednesday on MSNBC.</p>

<p>“If the court doesn’t reconsider, then in California, it’s hard to
believe we’ll be able to switch our model to full-time employment
quickly,” Khosrowshahi said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1293635588076326912">Justin Wolfers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, an admission that Uber’s key innovation was to skirt
labor law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1293594313926905856">Noah Smith</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever you think of the employee/contractor issue, it seems
clear that if Uber can’t survive except by classifying drivers as
contractors, it was never as valuable of a business as people
thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two things can both be true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Uber saw how terrible traditional U.S. taxi services were, and created a much better alternative that people love to use, entirely based on the key insight that ubiquitous smartphones could and should change the game. Hailing, mapping, location tracking, payment, driver/passenger rating — all of it enabled via phones.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that this business model was worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars was based almost entirely on exploiting a gray area in labor law, and thus the company’s workers.</p></li>
<li><p>The founder was an enormous jackass.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>OK, that’s three, but they’re still all true.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading more of Anne Applebaum’s <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/red-famine-anne-applebaum/1125686131?ean=9780804170888" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;Red Famine&quot;</a> and getting all sorts of smart. I&#39;ve also been getting all sorts of angry, all sorts of depressed, all sorts of horrified, all sorts of scared out of my mind, and all sorts of confirmation of my standing belief that people are no damned good.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution, when the Bolsheviks were consolidating their power in the nascent Soviet Union, Stalin, under Lenin’s direction, waged a war of attrition against Ukraine using starvation as a weapon of mass destruction. Kulak was a general term for prosperous small landholders and farmers. Shlikhter was Alexander Shikhter, the recently named People’s Commissar of Food Collection in Ukraine, and isn&#39;t that job title pure Soviet-speak?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While attacking the Kulaks, Shlikhter simultaneously created a new class of allies through the institution of “poor peasants” committees…[the committees] would later play a role in the Ukrainian famine, but their origins lay in this immediate, post-revolutionary moment, in Shlikhter’s first grain collection campaign. Under his direction, Red Army Soldiers and Russian agitators moved from village to village, recruiting the least successful, least productive, most opportunistic peasants and offering them power, privileges, and land confiscated from their neighbors. In exchange, these carefully recruited collaborators were expected to find and confiscate the “grain surpluses” of their neighbors. These mandatory grain collections created overwhelming anger and resentment, neither of which ever really went away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump said Thursday that <strong>he does not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are seeking to expand mail-in voting</strong> during the coronavirus pandemic, making explicit the reason he has declined to approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the cash-strapped agency.</p>
<p>“Now, they need that money in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. He added: <strong>“Now, if we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I don&#8217;t think anyone should be surprised that Trump is willing to wreck the postal service in order to gain some minor personal advantage. That&#8217;s our boy. But what still gets me is that he&#8217;s willing to blandly admit it on national TV and nobody seems to care. Does no one in the Republican Party object to this? Are Trump&#8217;s supporters so wildly anti-Democrat that they think this is a great idea?</p>
<p>And has no one ever told Trump that this isn&#8217;t going to hurt Democrats very much anyway? He&#8217;s just ruining the mail for nothing.</p>

I haven’t made one yet, because the last part hasn’t arrived, but I have high hopes.“ Note: This could be employed as a COVID-19 respirator but you’d need to add exhaust filters.</p>

<p>When you’re away from home for a few days, what to do about plants that need regular watering? Here’s a solution I just bumped into and am eager to try. Fill a clean bottle with water, put your fingers over the opening as you stab the bottle into the soil. The water will leach out as the soil gets dry. That’s the theory, anyone. Has anyone here tried this?</p>

<p id="p2">There was no better time than 2020 for my discovery of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal</a>, the immersive ambient noise app I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/portal-review-immersive-ambient-noise-with-philips-hue-integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed at the start of the year</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">Back in January Portal impressed me with its multifaceted approach to providing an escape from your current surroundings. Not only are the app&rsquo;s 3D soundscapes of a high sound quality and perfectly paired with headphones, especially noise-cancelling ones like AirPods Pro, but Portal also engages your other senses to help you focus, sleep, or mentally escape when you can&rsquo;t physically escape. One way the app does this is through its visual scenes, which provide each different sound portal with a location&rsquo;s snapshot that your imagination can lock on to. Another way is via Philips Hue integration, which enables your home lights to automatically sync to different colors and brightness settings that fit best with the portal environment you&rsquo;ve chosen. This combination of immersive sound with visual scenes and real-world correlation via smart lights makes Portal a uniquely holistic experience.</p>
<p id="p4">I&rsquo;ve been using Portal ever since January, but even more since March, when my ability to physically leave home was drastically scaled back. I don&rsquo;t use it when sleeping, but it&rsquo;s certainly helped me both focus and escape, providing the much-needed feeling of being in a new environment even when my physical surroundings are left unchanged. For these reasons, as well as the presence of features like breathing exercises in the app, I find it appropriate to call Portal not just an ambient noise utility, but a wellness app too.</p>
<p id="p5">Today, Portal is launching a big 3.0 update that leans into its core strengths by providing more of what makes the app great: its portals. Previously the app offered a total of 19 portals, and today that number more than doubles as 25 new portals have been added for a total of 44 &ndash; and more are on the way.</p>
<p id="p6"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p7">With any other ambient noise app, a large batch of new sounds would be a nice addition, but not necessarily worth writing a new article about. But with Portal, since each of the 25 additions represents a real location that&rsquo;s been captured and optimized for the app, and paired with a custom Hue preset, adding 25 portals was clearly a huge undertaking. That level of effort shines through with all of the app&rsquo;s portals.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/01f7ebe4-a6a7-4506-a79e-2e47401147ea.png" alt="A few of the new portals in version 3.0."><p class="image-caption">A few of the new portals in version 3.0.</p></div>
<p id="p9">The set of 25 new portals is split into two collections: 14 portals from the Scottish Highlands, which were captured at wintertime, and 11 from the Slovenian Alps in summer. The app&rsquo;s new content library says that a Devon &amp; Cornwall collection will be added soon too.</p>
<p id="p10">Speaking of the content library, the huge expansion of portals offered necessitated a change in how you navigate the app. Previously, all available portals resided in a simple horizontal row you could swipe through. Even with the 19 previous portals, though, this was a bit unwieldy to navigate. Now you start with a limited selection of portals, and browse new ones to add from the content library. There&rsquo;s even editorial content that&rsquo;s been added as you browse, so you can not only see what the location looks like and hear what it sounds like, but also read some additional context about it.</p>
<p id="p11">I&rsquo;ve yet to come across a portal I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, but it&rsquo;s nice that you can now keep only the portals you value most. Another positive change is that all your saved portals can be rearranged in the order you prefer, making the navigation system of swiping between portals function better than before.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9c871268-e75c-4345-aece-cdb8c7e29b74.png" alt="Adding a portal to your collection."><p class="image-caption">Adding a portal to your collection.</p></div>
<p id="p13">Along with the big portal expansion and plans for continued new collections being added, Portal is introducing a membership plan today. You can still download the app for free and enjoy six portals perpetually at no cost; gaining access to the full content library, however, will require a $29.99 annual subscription for new users following a 7-day free trial. Membership revenue is intended to fuel continued creation of new portals as well as enable the app to expand beyond the iPhone and iPad &ndash; Mac and Apple TV versions are in the plans for Portal&rsquo;s team. I hope support for iPad multitasking is on the roadmap too.</p>
<p id="p14">As part of this membership rollout, Portal&rsquo;s developers are providing some of the most generous transition offers I&rsquo;ve seen for existing users of the app. If you&rsquo;ve previously paid for Portal in any way, either through unlocking the app&rsquo;s In-App Purchase or buying it when it was a paid app, you&rsquo;ll receive a lifetime membership entirely free. And if you&rsquo;ve previously downloaded the app at all, even though you&rsquo;ve never paid for it, you can unlock a lifetime membership for a one-time In-App Purchase of $9.99.</p>
<hr id="hr15"><p id="p16">Portal has proven essential to my peace of mind and productivity this year as I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time in a small New York City apartment, trying to work while my wife does the same just a few feet away. Combined with my AirPods Pro and noise cancellation, the app has been a dependable escape and focus tool. Both for work and relaxation, it&rsquo;s hard to beat the uniquely immersive experience Portal provides. If you ever find yourself in situations &ndash; whether at home, at the office, or elsewhere &ndash; when you need to create the feeling of being transported elsewhere, but can&rsquo;t actually leave, I can&rsquo;t recommend Portal highly enough.</p>
<p id="p17">Portal is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on the App Store</a> for iPhone and iPad.</p>

    <p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services?srnd=premium">may be ready to unleash a bundle of subscriptions alongside the iPhone this fall</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurman’s careful to note that the bundle plans may change—which should go without saying, given that this is still a few months off. But the proposed structure here is interesting. Layering TV+ and Music at the base makes sense on the face of it: they’re both media services and Apple has a ton of control over how it sells TV+ (witness the free year that it offered along with device purchases starting last fall). Music is also probably one of the company’s strongest both in terms of paid subscribers and in terms of how it structures its deals with content providers.</p>
<p>Arcade makes sense as an add-on. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, its adoption seems to have slowed somewhat, which jibes with recent reports that Apple was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-30/apple-cancels-arcade-games-in-strategy-shift-to-keep-subscribers">reconsidering its strategy</a>. And News+ has been glacial in its pick-up by both consumers and news providers alike.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with iCloud, thrown in there at the end with a shrug. It’s perhaps the least interesting of Apple’s services, but also among the most in demand, thanks in no small part to the measly 5GB of standard storage the company continues to offer for free. By putting that at the high end of the pay list, users who want that storage may be convinced to fork over more money with the philosophy that at least they get a bunch of stuff thrown in (even if it’s stuff they don’t want).</p>
<p>Or, as one of the biggest and catchiest lies in capitalism has always put forth: “the more you spend, the more you save.”<sup id="fnref-12714-themoreyouspend"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12714-themoreyouspend" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One additional tidbit that Gurman mentions is that Apple is working on a new subscription service focused around fitness, à la offerings from Nike. Given the rebranding of the Activity app to Fitness, and Apple’s continuing interests in health, this seems utterly plausible.</p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be that consumers will save $2-5 a month via bundle pricing. Which isn’t <em>nothing</em>, especially given the amount most consumers are probably paying for their mountain of subscriptions these days, but also may not prove that attractive. The real question will be whether Apple’s services are enticing enough to convince most customers to pay for ones that they might not even want.</p>

    <p>At first glance I thought this was just an exquisitely well-done gag, a recreation of some still frames. But it’s more than that. This short film by Lydia Cambron actually <em>works</em>. It’s magnificent.</p>

<p>If you want my advice, <a href="https://vimeo.com/446927270">watch the movie</a> before you even look at her website for it. And do not skip the credits, they’re truly essential.</p>

    <p>Tripp Mickle wrote a long feature for The Wall Street Journal, “How Tim Cook Made Apple His Own” (<a href="https://apple.news/Azb-hAvJuS4yr89Cy8Pccog">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Steve Jobs’s death, Silicon Valley anticipated Apple Inc.’s
business would falter. Wall Street fretted about the road ahead.
And loyal customers agonized about the future of a beloved product
innovator.</p>

<p>Today, Apple shares are at record highs. The company’s market
valuation is $1.9 trillion — bigger than the GDP of Canada,
Russia or Spain. And Apple, now the world’s largest company,
continues to dominate the smartphone market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good and mostly fair lede. But I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that “loyal customers agonized about the future”. Where’s the evidence of that? I’d say the group that’s missing after Silicon Valley (which believes strongly, justifiably in most cases, in the importance of founders) and Wall Street are business reporters. It wasn’t so much investors as the business media who predicted “can’t innovate without Steve Jobs” doom for Apple.</p>

<p>The feature is largely fair though, and it does read like Mickle tried very hard to get people who know Cook to talk about him. But, well, very few of them did, and those who did don’t seem to know him all that well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Cook is described by colleagues and acquaintances as a humble
workaholic with a singular commitment to Apple. Longtime
colleagues seldom socialized with him, and assistants said he kept
his calendar clear of personal events.</p>

<p>Around Thanksgiving two years ago, guests saw him dining by
himself at the secluded Amangiri Hotel near Zion National Park.
When a guest later bumped into him, he said he came to the hotel
to recharge after a hectic fall punctuated by the rollout of
Apple’s latest iPhone. “They have the best masseuses in the world
here,” he said, the guest recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Mickle’s source is a random guest who recognized Cook at a hotel.</p>

<p>It’s sort of inside baseball, but this paragraph is my favorite from the whole piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple declined to make Mr. Cook or any of its executives
available. Instead, the company helped arrange calls with four
people it said could speak to areas of importance to Mr. Cook such
as environmentalism, education and health. None of the four said
they knew him well. One had never met him, another met him only in
passing, a third spent half an hour with him and a fourth spent a
few hours with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean just savor the passive-aggressive <em>fuck you/fuck you too</em> back-and-forth of Apple making available four useless sources to Mickle, and Mickle pointing out in the article just how useless the four sources Apple made available were.</p>

<p>But this one weird paragraph actually says a lot about the difference between Steve Jobs’s Apple and Cook’s. Jobs wouldn’t have participated in a profile like this, either, but I think Apple’s response would have been nothing more than the two-letter word “no”. With Cook, Apple still didn’t make him available, still didn’t make anyone who works at Apple available, and still didn’t make anyone who actually knows Cook available. But they offered Mickle and the Journal <em>something</em> rather than just telling him to go pound sand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though current and former employees say Mr. Cook has created a
more relaxed workplace than Mr. Jobs, he has been similarly
demanding and detail oriented. He once got irritated that the
company mistakenly shipped 25 computers to South Korea instead of
Japan, said a former colleague, adding that it seemed like a minor
misstep for a company shipping nearly 200 million iPhones
annually. “We’re losing our commitment to excellence,” Mr. Cook
said, this person recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>25 computers mistakenly shipped to Korea would not make my list of signs that Apple is losing its commitment to excellence, but this anecdote actually buoys me.</p>

    <p>Catalin Cimpanu, reporting for ZDNet Zero Day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, Mozilla’s contract with Google to include Google as
the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later
this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal
has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla’s
revenue, and without it experts see <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">a dim future for Mozilla past
2021</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s basically the whole story right there. Firefox was very popular, and Google paid Mozilla a small fortune to make Google search the default in Firefox because it was so popular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">But then came Chrome</a>. Why should Google fund Mozilla when Chrome is about 10 times more popular than Firefox, other than out of the goodness of their heart?</p>

<p>It is a very good thing for the world and the web that a truly independent browser exists from a privacy-minded company, but there’s not much of a business model for it unless it’s popular enough to get the dominant search engine to pay for placement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We must learn and expand different ways to support ourselves and
build a business that isn’t what we see today.”</p>

<p>This most likely includes a bigger focus <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-to-launch-vpn-product-in-the-next-few-weeks/">on Mozilla’s VPN
offering</a>, which Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/07/15/mozilla-puts-its-trusted-stamp-on-vpn/">formally launched last month</a>.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps are one of today’s biggest
money-makers in tech, and Mozilla, despite arriving late to the
party, is set to become one of the biggest players on the market,
primarily due to its reputation as a privacy-first organization
and civil and privacy rights advocate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea if a VPN offering can even come close to making up for the money Mozilla was earning from Google for default search placement, but it’s a great idea. If you’re going to use a VPN, you want to use one from a company you can trust, and Mozilla has a fortune of well-earned trust in the bank.</p>

    <p>I was explaining to someone this evening that I&#8217;m in the habit of saying &#8220;bang&#8221; rather than &#8220;exclamation point.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-pronounce.html">list</a> of similar nicknames for symbols.</p>
<p>These nicknames could complement the NATO phonetic alphabet if you needed to read symbols out loud, say over the phone. You might, for example, pronounce &#8220;HL&amp;P&#8221; as &#8220;Hotel Lima Pretzel Papa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you might use them to have one-syllable names for every symbol. This is a different objective than maximizing phonetic distinctiveness. For example, referring to <code>#</code> and <code>$</code> as &#8220;hash&#8221; and &#8220;cash&#8221; is succinct, but could easily be misheard.</p>
<p>You could also optimize for being clever. Along those lines, I like the idea of pronouncing <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> as &#8220;wane&#8221; and &#8220;wax&#8221;, by analogy with phases of the moon, though this would be a bad choice if you want to be widely and quickly understood.</p>
<p>Even if someone understood the allusion to lunar phases, and they knew which one looks like an opening parenthesis and which one looks like a closing parenthesis, they might get your meaning backward because they don&#8217;t live in the same hemisphere you do! I implicitly assumed the perspective of the northern hemisphere in the paragraph above. Someone from the southern hemisphere would understand &#8220;wane&#8221; to mean <code>)</code> and &#8220;wax&#8221; to mean <code>(</code>.</p>

    <p>Is this the most boring job in the world? I took this picture at 4:30 in the morning on Highway 78 in the middle of nowhere. I was probably the first car this guy had seen in an hour. Still, there&#8217;s something about the actinic glare of the light that&#8217;s oddly attractive. Plus I didn&#8217;t have anything else to do while I waited around for my lane to open up, so I figured I might as well take some pictures.</p>

    <p>A few days ago President Trump held a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/">rambling press conference</a> in which he promised to do something about Social Security taxes. He&#8217;s already signed an executive action that (if it passes muster in the courts) would defer all payroll taxes through December but then require them to be paid back in a lump sum in January. So one thing he wants to do is forgive the repayment. But then there was more. Trump started to blather about &#8220;extending&#8221; the payroll tax deferral. Finally, apparently unable to stop himself, he went further and promised to permanently reduce or even terminate the payroll tax. Later in the day, his campaign made that promise explicit:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">President <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a>: If I am victorious on November 3rd I plan to make permanent cuts to the payroll tax <a href="https://t.co/7N0D0o4A18">pic.twitter.com/7N0D0o4A18</a></p>
<p>— Team Trump (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TeamTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1292200472837795843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As with most things, your best bet in this case is to ignore everything Trump says. It&#8217;s just meaningless chatter that even Trump himself probably doesn&#8217;t understand. But guess what? In this case, he&#8217;s accidentally stumbled onto a great idea.</p>
<p>You see, we <em>should</em> terminate the payroll tax. It&#8217;s regressive, it&#8217;s pointless, and it long ago stopped serving its original purpose. We should get rid of it and simply fund Social Security out of general tax revenues, just like everything else. Why should it have a less reliable funding source than the Pentagon, after all?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. Get rid of the payroll tax and increase the personal and corporate income taxes to make up the revenue. At the same time, we can make a bonfire out of the bonds in the Social Security trust fund, televised on national TV for everyone to see. There would be no more ridiculous talk about Social Security &#8220;going bankrupt&#8221; or endless arguments about whether the trust fund is &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;fully funded over the 75-year window.&#8221; When it&#8217;s all over, we&#8217;d pay for Social Security (and Medicare) the same way everything else is paid for: through general purpose taxes. This would save Social Security and Medicare and ensure their full funding forever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad this was just Trump blather. If he were serious about it, it would have been a great idea.</p>

    <p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been nine years since Apple introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop">AirDrop</a> as a part of Mac OS X Lion and iOS 7. I consider AirDrop to be one of Apple’s best moves of the past decade. It’s a feature I have used hundreds of times and have come to rely on to quickly exchange files and other information with my own devices and with the devices used by my friends and family.</p>
<p>But just because AirDrop is useful doesn’t mean it couldn’t be better. In fact, I would argue that it’s been largely ignored the last few years, and could stand some major upgrades that would benefit users of iPhones, iPads, and Macs alike.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3570779/airdrop-is-great-for-the-iphone-ipad-and-mac-but-it-can-be-even-better-heres-how.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

<h5><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tom Wolfe in New York City circa 1970. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/obituaries/tom-wolfe-pyrotechnic-nonfiction-writer-and-novelist-dies-at-88.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sam Falk/The New York Times.</a></span></h5>
<p>I used to be a Tom Wolfe fan. Back in the day. Then I caught on to his act. After that, he became a bore, and I stopped reading him. When he died two years ago, I felt I owed him some appreciation, so I tried to force my way through <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/back-to-blood-tom-wolfe/1013623898?ean=9780316036337" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Back to Blood”</a>. I liked it---up until I didn’t, which was about a third of a way in. The other day, though, I started to re-read “Radical Chic”. It came up in the book Ken Mannion and I have been listening to, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/days-of-rage-bryan-burrough/1120553118?ean=9780143107972&amp;aug=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Days of Rage”</a> by Bryan Burrough. So I decided to give it a re-read. It’s not boring. It’s annoying. But, you know, when he stopped posing, the man could write. And he could always get off a snappy line…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...by 1965---as in 1935, as in 1926, as in 1866, as in 1820---New York has had two societies, “Old New York” and “New Society”. In every era, “Old New York” has taken a horrified look at “New Society” and expressed the devout conviction that a genuine aristocracy, good blood, good bone---themselves---was being defiled by a horde of climbers...In the 1960’s, this quaint belief was magnified by the fact that many members of “New Society,” for the first time, were not Protestant. The names and addresses of “Old New York” were to be found in the Social Register...It was and still is, an almost exclusively a roster of Protestant families. Today, however, the Social Register’s annual shuffle, in which errant socialites...are dropped from [that roster], hardly even rates a yawn. The fact is that “Old New York”---except for those members who figure in “New Society”, e.g. [New York State’s Governor] Nelson Rockefeller...is no longer good copy, and without publicity it has <em>never</em> been easy to rank as a fashionable person in New York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well,<em> I</em> thought it was snappy.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 11. The US passed a milestone on Tuesday: total deaths from COVID-19 passed 500 per million. This is not the hightest rate even among the small selection of countries I track here, but it will probably be the highest before long. Here&#8217;s what the trendlines look like:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858471"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1276px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858471" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_deaths_per_million_trend.gif" alt="" width="1276" height="559"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;ll pass Italy and Sweden by the end of the month, and maybe even the UK by the end of September. It all depends on how quickly we get past our second peak, something that none of the other countries had. We didn&#8217;t have to have it either, but that&#8217;s what happens when your national leadership is asleep at the wheel.</p>

<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been less than a year since Apple launched <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-web-based-music-app-as-public-beta/" rel="noopener noreferrer">its first public beta of the Apple Music web player</a>, which after several months came out of beta earlier this year and resides at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>. On the heels of an updated Music app in this fall&rsquo;s releases of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and more, the company isn&rsquo;t delaying keeping its web player in-sync with the app versions. A new public beta of Apple Music for web can be accessed now at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, sporting a design to match the changes seen in the forthcoming macOS 11 and iPadOS 14, and a new Listen Now page that replaces the prior For You option.</p>
<p id="p3">The design refresh doesn&rsquo;t bring major changes, just aesthetic tweaks to elements like the sidebar. Listen Now represents the most substantial update, but it still works similarly to the former For You page. It contains collections of recommended albums and playlists based on your listening activity, alongside Apple Music&rsquo;s algorithmic playlists like New Music Mix and Chill Mix. You&rsquo;ll also find Recently Played, New Releases from artists in your Library, and a new prominent section called Top Picks. After using Listen Now in the OS betas for the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve grown to prefer it over For You, despite there being relatively few differences between the two. Having Top Picks front and center, for example, is a better choice for me than For You&rsquo;s placement of the algorithmic playlists up top, since I rarely listen to those.</p>
<p id="p4">It&rsquo;s great to see that Apple Music&rsquo;s web player will be updated on the same cycle as its apps. Apple&rsquo;s history with iterating its web apps isn&rsquo;t great (iCloud.com, anyone?), but to better compete against Spotify, which has a first-class web player, a more intentional approach for Apple Music is needed.</p>
<p id="p5">Anyone can access the beta version of Apple Music&rsquo;s web player at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, while the previous version is still accessible at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Theodore Schleifer says that the tech community will be happy with Joe Biden&#8217;s choice of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/11/21364027/kamala-harris-joe-biden-vice-president-silicon-valley-donors-tech">Kamala Harris as his running mate:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooper Teboe, a top Democratic fundraiser in Silicon Valley, <strong>said about one-third of major West Coast donors that he’s spoken to have been waiting to see who Biden would choose as vice president before deciding whether to invest tens of thousands of dollars into Democrats this cycle.</strong> Should Biden have chosen Warren, for instance, tech donors might’ve had concerns.</p>
<p>“She is the safest pick for the donor community,” Teboe said of Harris. “She will be the pick that the California, Silicon Valley donor community — who are worried about things like tech and repatriation and taxes and so on and so forth — she is the pick that they will be happiest with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? A full third of these geniuses were holding off because they first wanted to know who Biden&#8217;s VP would be? Don&#8217;t they know that veeps have no real influence on policy at all? It&#8217;s hardly a big secret.</p>
<p>This just confirms the general sense I&#8217;ve always gotten that Silicon Valley folks are surprisingly ignorant of even the basics of politics. It&#8217;s easy to make some snarky point about this and then move on, but it&#8217;s genuinely kind of mysterious. I suppose they so desperately wish politics didn&#8217;t exist that they just wall themselves off from it.</p>

    <p>Justin Kroll and Mike Fleming Jr., reporting for Deadline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two and one-half months after it stepped up to become the
producers of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, Apple has inked a
first-look deal with its director, Martin Scorsese. The master
filmmaker will base his Sikelia Productions banner at Apple in a
multi-year deal for film and television projects Scorsese will
produce and direct for Apple TV +.</p>

<p>The relationship kicks off with <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, the
Eric Roth-scripted adaptation of the David Grann non-fiction book
which will star Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro will star in.
Apple won an auction with the $180 million+ film originally
optioned by Paramount came back on the market. Deadline revealed
on May 27 that Apple won a deal that has Paramount releasing the
film theatrically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to apply Apple’s “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">the best, not the most</a>” mantra to Hollywood would be signing more deals like this. Apple TV+ will never have the most exclusive movies and TV shows, but it can have a large share of the <em>best</em> ones.</p>

    <p>David Sparks <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/8/blogging-from-space">wrote an article in VR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I recently tried out a new Oculus app that is intriguing. <a href="https://immersedvr.com/">The app is called <em>Immersed</em></a>, and it is quite a trip. With the app on your Oculus Quest and the host software loaded on your Mac, you can have your Mac’s monitor appear in virtual space. They have a lot of options ranging from an alpine cabin, to a “productivity cave”, to a starship. I am currently orbiting the planet Earth on a starship while I compose this blog post. We just flew over Mexico.

    <p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><em><strong>Posted Tuesday afternoon, August 11, 2020.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e20263e95baab2200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Politics Newshouds Mo Dowd undated uncredited AP photo via Hollywood Reporter" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e20263e95baab2200b img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e20263e95baab2200b-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Politics Newshouds Mo Dowd undated uncredited AP photo via Hollywood Reporter" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="color: #5b5b5b;"><strong>Hello. She’s Maureen Dowd, and you’re not:</strong> New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd in an undated and uncredited AP photo<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-hack-how-a-maureen-756872" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> via the Hollywood Reporter.</a></span></h5>
<p>Apropos of nothing...Well, ok, of <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-maureen-dowd-hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-new-york-times-column-20200808-2iwbv35cbvcbfefshupfybuxs4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>something-</em></a>--here’s an anecdote from <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-world-as-it-is-ben-rhodes/1127923924?ean=9780525509370" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The World as It Is”</a>, Ben Rhodes’ memoir of his time as President Obama’s deputy national security advisor and chief speechwriter...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That night, Obama looked relieved to be over the hump of the speech as he joined the staff in a local restaurant for drinks with the traveling press. He ordered a martini and seemed at ease amid a cluster of people straining the hear the casual conversation he was making at one end of the table. I was seated next to Maureen Dowd, a columnist from the <em>New York Times</em> whom I’d read for years. I was excited and a little nervous. “Who are you?” she asked. “The speechwriter,” I said. He gave me a level stare and then complained that she wasn’t seated next to someone more important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhodes doesn’t pass off Dowd’s remark as a joke. He makes it plain it was a complaint, and issuing from Dowd’s sense of self-importance. The speech Rhodes had written was the one Obama delivered in the summer of 2008 to a crowd of 200,000 in Berlin. At the time it was still a good bet that Hillary Clinton would win the nomination. It was an audacious and hopeful decision (See what I did there?) to leave the campaign trail to grandstand on the foreign stage to show he was fit to be the leader of the Free World. It could have been a disaster. Instead, the speech was a tremendous success. The Germans loved it. So did most of the rest of the world. It can be argued that it helped him win the nomination and the Presidency. It was an important speech. Dowd can be excused for not realizing that night at the restaurant how important and for not intuiting how important Rhodes would grow to be in the Obama administration. But she had a chance to talk to the person who’d written the speech and ask him about the thinking that went into it and what it was meant to reveal about Obama’s foreign policy plans if he was elected and what that implied about the kind of president he’d be. Instead she was just miffed she couldn’t rub shoulders with the sort of political insiders she regarded as being on her level.</p>
<p>Dowd doesn’t have the cachet she had in July 2008. Among liberals on social media, she’s almost universally dismissed as a hack. But readers of the Times who have lives offline still read her with interest and approval. Pop Mannion read her assiduously right up until the end. And not just for political insight into the way the world works. He didn’t need her insight, particularly. He was fairly insightful himself, to put it mildly, and he read many sources for help in coming to his one conclusions. He read her or the pleasure he took in her writing about anything, and for writing lessons he could apply to writing his columns for the local newspapers. I’ve never been a fan. I used to read her as assiduously as Pop back when she was first coming into her own and her skills as a reporter still informed her political analyses, and not her high opinion of herself as reporter and analyst, back when she was more of a journalist and less of a purveyor of high-minded gossip. These days---not having a life off social media---I only read her when another one of her columns has blown up my twitter timeline, to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Dowd isn’t as lazy and facile as David Brooks. She isn’t shut up inside an intellectual fortress built of arrogance, entitlement, pomposity, and self-regard like Bret Stephens. But she can be as egregious in her way as both. Vanity and self-importance are the twined hallmarks of the writing styles of all three.</p>
<p>So I get a quick out of the sly way Rhodes offhandedly gets a bit of his own back there in the middle of the passage. There, where he identifies Dowd as “a columnist for the New York Times.” Not <em>the</em> columnist, one his readers are likely to recognize, without needing Rhodes to tell them who she is. And not <em>THE</em> columnist, the most famous and most-read New York Times columnist at the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>A</strong></em> columnist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p>In case you&#39;ve forgotten what all the fuss was about---there&#39;s been a lot more serious stuff to fuss about since---follow the llink to <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-maureen-dowd-hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-new-york-times-column-20200808-2iwbv35cbvcbfefshupfybuxs4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;Hillary Clinton mocks columnist Maureen Dowd for forgetting 2016 presidential ticket had a woman and man&quot;</a> by Dave Goldiner at the New York Daily News. It&#39;s fun to see Hillary get a little of her own back from Dowd who has been mean-girling her for going on twenty-five years.</p>
<p>And I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-world-as-it-is-ben-rhodes/1127923924?ean=9780525509370" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;The World as It Is&quot;</a>. It&#39;s one of the best political memoirs I&#39;ve read. Not only does it provide serious insight into the workings of the Obama administration---Rhodes is no mere purveyor of high-minded gossip---it&#39;s a good how-to manual for anyone who wants to go to work in politics and government. Not to mention, Rhodes can <em>write.</em></p>

    <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/11/setapp-subscription-service-now-include-ios-apps/">William Gallagher</a> (also: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/setapp-mac-app-subscription-service-expands-to-ios/">MacRumors</a>, <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/setapp-now-includes-ios-apps/">Mike Schmitz</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/11/setapp-subscription-service-now-include-ios-apps/"><p>Having launched back in 2017 with just 61 apps, Setapp is a continually growing subscription service which gives users access to paid-for apps for one monthly fee. Currently hosting around 190 Mac apps, the service has now added its first iOS ones.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>At launch, the major titles in the eight are the Ulysses writing app, and MindNode mind-mapping tool. It also includes Taskheat and 2Do task managers, the Paste clipboard manager, PDF Search, and SQLPro Studio.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Once you have an iOS device registered to your Setapp account, each eligible app&rsquo;s page on the Mac Setapp app contains a pair of QR codes. The first downloads the app from the App Store to your iOS device, then the second unlocks it.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1293248596830294022">Ryan Jones</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1293248596830294022">
<p>THIS BREAKS A GAZILLION RULES. We spend weeks making mental pretzels to understand the latest rule bullshit, and the something that breaks multiple explicit rules is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard about this a while ago and always assumed it <em>would</em> be allowed, because even though the guidelines forbid unlocking via means other than IAP, they specifically allow unlocking for multi-platform apps. This works for Microsoft and The Omni Group, and I don&rsquo;t see why Setapp unlocking the iOS versions of Mac apps would be any different.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"><p>3.1.1 In-App Purchase</p>
<p>If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services: Apps that operate across multiple platforms may allow users to access content, subscriptions, or features they have acquired in your app on other platforms or your web site, including consumable items in multiplatform games, provided those items are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Setapp/status/1293234916017213440">Setapp</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/Setapp/status/1293234916017213440">
<p>We would never put our vendors at risk. Therefore we&rsquo;ve received approval from Apple before going forward. It was confirmed that applications with integrated Setapp iOS framework fulfill the App Store Guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a lot of people shared Jones&rsquo; reaction, so I guess we&rsquo;ll see. The rules are anything but &ldquo;transparent and applied equally,&rdquo; as Tim Cook stated. <a href="https://afridigest.substack.com/p/why-super-apps-are-proliferating">WeChat</a> (via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23300199">Hacker News</a>) remains in the App Store despite offering a store within a store, and it&rsquo;s threatened more on iOS by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/kuo-wechat-ban-iphone-shipments/">U.S. government</a> than by App Store policy.</p>

<p>(My <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> app is <a href="https://c-command.com/store/setapp/toothfairy">available on Setapp</a> but is unaffected by this issue as it&rsquo;s Mac-only.)</p>

<p id="setapp-for-ios-update-2020-08-12">Update (2020-08-12): <a href="https://twitter.com/MuellerSimhofer/status/1293506552482144257">Markus M&uuml;ller-Simhofer</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/MuellerSimhofer/status/1293506552482144257"><p>Section 3.1.1 is mentioned a lot when people comment on the legality of Setapp for iOS, but based on my reading it doesn&rsquo;t apply here. It&rsquo;s correct that Setapp uses a QR code, but this code doesn&rsquo;t unlock the app. It contains a &ldquo;magic link&rdquo;/&ldquo;account token&rdquo;.</p><p>This token is used to login the user into their account (similar to how Slack uses a magic link in emails to login). This token identifies the user and based on this information the Setapp framework tells us the subscription state of the user.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Based on my interpretation this is similar to what other companies (e.g. Microsoft) are doing with their cross platform subscriptions.
We also never mention Setapp in the app, the App Store description or App Store release notes. We only promote the App Store subscription.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/2020/08/12/setapp-subscription-service-adds-ios-companion-apps/">Adam Engst</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://tidbits.com/2020/08/12/setapp-subscription-service-adds-ios-companion-apps/"><p>When I asked if Setapp planned to add any iOS-only apps or if the only iOS apps would be companions to Mac apps, Setapp PR manager Julia Petryk&rsquo;s response suggested, albeit a bit ambiguously, that iOS-only apps might be in Setapp&rsquo;s future: &ldquo;Yes, iOS apps will go through the review process by the Setapp review team and in case of their approval, they will join Setapp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given Apple&rsquo;s explicit prohibition&mdash;<i>Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc.</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Apple will allow Setapp to provide access to iOS-only apps. But if there&rsquo;s one thing we&rsquo;ve learned with the App Store, it&rsquo;s that Apple reserves the right to interpret or change the rules as it wants.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/"><p>Mozilla  laid off about 70 employees today, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>In an internal memo, Mozilla chairwoman and interim CEO Mitchell Baker specifically mentions the slow rollout of the organization&rsquo;s new revenue-generating products as the reason for why it needed to take this action. The overall number may still be higher, though, as Mozilla is still looking into how this decision will affect workers in the U.K. and France. In 2018, Mozilla Corporation (as opposed to the much smaller Mozilla Foundation) said it had about 1,000 employees worldwide.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/"><p>Today we announced a significant restructuring of Mozilla Corporation. This will strengthen our ability to build and invest in products and services that will give people alternatives to conventional Big Tech. Sadly, the changes also include a significant reduction in our workforce by approximately 250 people.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To start, that means products that mitigate harms or address the kinds of the problems that people face today. Over the longer run, our goal is to build new experiences that people love and want, that have better values and better characteristics inside those products.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges. How can we lead towards business models that honor and protect people while creating opportunities for our business to thrive? How can we, or others who want a better internet, or those who feel like a different balance should exist between social and public benefit and private profit offer an alternative? We need to identify those people and join them. We must learn and expand different ways to support ourselves and build a business that isn&rsquo;t what we see today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is all rather vague, but it sounds like they want to diversify away from Firefox and have <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonSapin/status/1293231187167784960">laid off</a> most of the Servo team. What could be more important to the mission than maintaining an independent browser engine? On the other hand, Firefox is expensive to develop, and it&rsquo;s not clear how to replace the funding that had been provided by its primary competitor.</p>

<p>It was making 100s of millions of dollars per year from the default search provider deal, for over a decade. It could have saved most of that money, spending it only on 50 to 100 browser engineers. Branching out to MDN and websocket or webrtc libraries would also make sense. But the rest of the crap, the marketing, the rebranding, the Pocket purchase and integration, Firefox OS, the voice recognition and AI stuff (and notice the announcement, they&rsquo;re keeping the AI division, really need that part apparently), stuff that nobody remembers, that&rsquo;s all a waste of money that could be saved by the non-profit foundation to just support the low-level engine keeping the open web viable.</p>

    <p>My mother chose today&#8217;s photo. &#8220;Pick anything you want,&#8221; I said grandly. &#8220;Anything at all.&#8221; Naturally that meant she&#8217;d end up picking a picture much like yesterday&#8217;s. But I said anything, so what could I do?</p>
<p>Anyway, the two rightmost peaks (Modjeska and Santiago) form Saddleback, which is sort of a looming presence throughout Orange County. That is, it&#8217;s a looming presence <em>unless</em> you get up close and shoot it on an exceptionally clear day, as I did here. From this angle, in fact, you rightly wonder why anyone bothered to give it a name at all. Sometime in the future I&#8217;ll take a picture that shows Saddleback the way it&#8217;s more commonly seen, and its looming-ness will become a little more obvious.</p>

    <p>Is this true?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Millennials aren&#8217;t just the first generation set to do worse than our parents and our grandparents. If not for the (badly tattered) social safety net, we would be the most impoverished young adults since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) <a href="https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/1293201489125613568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></p>

<p>Pretty much, yes. <a href="https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Pathways_SOTU_2019_SafetyNet.pdf">This is for 30-year olds:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858308"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858308" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_poverty_generations.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="1194"></figure>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising. Many Millennials faced the full force of the Great Recession in their early 30s, and that had a big effect on their income. At the same time, the system worked the way it was intended: they also received more government assistance than other generations during this time. When you put this together, their poverty rate was about the same as Gen X and lower than either boomers or boomer parents at the same age:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858314"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858314" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_poverty_generations_2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="645"></figure>
<p>My only real objection to Filipovic&#8217;s tweet is her description of the social safety net as &#8220;badly tattered.&#8221; In fact, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/02/heres-why-bernie-sanders-doesnt-say-much-about-welfare-reform/">it&#8217;s grown steadily since the 60s</a> and is quite robust these days. Republicans seem to spend their entire careers fighting to tear it apart, but the truth is that they&#8217;ve only nibbled around the edges. We may still not be as generous to the poor as social democratic Europe—and our anti-poverty programs are egregiously splintered and inefficient—but spending is pretty high and it&#8217;s reponsible for keeping poverty at lower real levels than it was for older generations.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I think it&#8217;s important to keep two things in mind at the same time. It&#8217;s true that Millennials face unusual pressures: the Great Recession, student debt, and high housing costs foremost among them. At the same time, Millennial income at age 30 has recovered from the Great Recession and is now higher than it was for boomers and Xers.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_858323"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1274px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-858323" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_family_income_age_30-1.gif" alt="" width="1274" height="623"></figure>
<p>(This data precedes the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be years before we know how that affected different generations.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: Millennials, on net, are not as well off as previous generations: they have slightly higher incomes but noticeably higher expenses. At the same time, the difference with previous generations is smallish and they really aren&#8217;t massively impoverished. The real scandal here isn&#8217;t so much intergenerational as inter-class: Why is it that income has barely budged for <em>everyone</em> in the past three generations?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the rich have gotten nearly all the gains. That&#8217;s the common enemy, not the ordinary folks who are a decade older or younger than you.</p>

    <p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to crack down on loud, persistent house parties that are potential spreaders of COVID-19. How? By giving police who respond to complaints the authority to request that utilities at the property be cut off. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-10/police-union-party-house-garcetti-crackdown">The police union is having none of it:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mayor Garcetti wants to reimagine policing. He should send his civilian staff to turn off people’s electricity &amp; cut off their water,” the League said in a tweet over the weekend in response to the mayor’s plans. “Let officers deal with the rise in shootings and killings in L.A. We need a leader and not a political contortionist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a minor temper tantrum and I doubt anything will come of it. More generally, though, this kind of attitude has become so widespread in the wake of attempts to reform policing that I wonder if police forces risk losing the support of people who would normally be on their side? How long will taxpayers put up with threats to stop doing their job every time police forces are asked to make even the smallest change or sacrifice? It&#8217;s childish stuff and before long it&#8217;s likely to create a backlash that does the police no good.</p>

<p class="">For the last few months, I have been playing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/" target="_blank"><span>with an Oculus Quest</span></a>. I never really had any experience with virtual reality (VR) before, and I decided that there was no better time to look for a little escape than amid the pandemic.</p><p class="">The technology is impressive, yet I don’t find myself spending more than a few hours a week in virtual space. Of course, there is a <em>Star Wars</em> game and, of course, that is where I spend the most time.</p><p class="">However, I recently tried out a new Oculus app that is intriguing.&nbsp;<a href="https://immersedvr.com/" target="_blank"><span>The app is called <em>Immersed</em></span></a>, and it is quite a trip. With the app on your Oculus Quest and the host software loaded on your Mac, you can have your Mac’s monitor appear in virtual space. They have a lot of options ranging from an alpine cabin, to a “productivity cave”, to a starship. I am currently orbiting the planet Earth on a starship while I compose this blog post. We just flew over Mexico.</p><p class="">If you have never played with a VR device before, they are something else. The resolution is not as high as a retina screen, but the overall impression is that you are someplace else. It is easy to lose track of your actual surroundings while in VR. The above screenshot does not do it justice. It is entirely readable. The surprising thing about <em>Immersed</em> is that it works. I am able to write this post (and several others) with no noticeable lag in typing, and part of me actually thinks I am on a starship. There are, of course, a few downsides:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The screen resolution isn’t nearly as good as my standard monitor. Also, I had to set my monitor display to its largest size to really make this work. That said, I can read and interact with the entire screen with little or no eye strain.</p></li><li><p class="">Unlike the keyboard, my wireless mouse can get laggy. Not always, but sometimes. It’s fine for text editing, but lousy for gaming.</p></li><li><p class="">You really need to be a touch typist to make this work. You can’t see your keyboard or mouse at all because you are in space, or a cabin, or on top of a mountain, or a creepy cave that is supposed to make you productive.</p></li><li><p class="">Facebook! That company that I don’t like makes this thing I have strapped on my head. You can have an account without signing into Facebook, but in order to get this screenshot exported, I had to log in to Facebook for the first time in years. I can only guess what it is going to take for me to unring that bell. Talk about taking one for the team.</p></li><li><p class="">Weight and battery life. This app and the connection seems to be burning up my Oculus battery at a rate of 30% per hour. Also, the Oculus itself gets heavy on your head after a while.</p></li><li><p class="">After spending a few hours in virtual space, I felt a bit fatigued. I don’t know if it was the screen resolution, the motion of my starship, or the weight of the device on my head, but I was ready to return to Earth. I don’t think I could do this for more than a few hours at a time.</p></li></ul><p class="">This is really just a first step. I could see myself working in a virtual zen garden or on the planet Endor for extended periods of time once these VR devices get lighter and better. I’m having a great time writing several posts for this week in a spaceship. I may go down to my alpine cabin next for an OmniFocus review session. Seriously, this is fun for a productivity nerd like me. I will report back in a month to tell you if I am still using it or if the shininess wore off. In the meantime, I just passed over Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <p>As a person of routine, part of my morning regimen for the last several decades is settling down with my morning cup of tea and reading some comic strips. As a kid, I’d dig through the newspaper to find the funny pages, and the full-color Sunday section was the highlight of the week.</p>
<p>But for the past twenty years or so, my comic strip reading has been all digital; I’ve even added a few webcomics into the mix over time.<sup id="fnref-12693-abandoned"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-abandoned" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> At some point in the dim and misty past, I put all of my comics into a folder in my browser’s bookmark bar; every morning, I would click (or later tap) that folder and all my comics would open in tabs.</p>
<p>As systems go, it’s fine. But it presents two challenges: first, not every comic I read updates on the same schedule. Some are seven-day affairs, like reruns of “Calvin &amp; Hobbes” and “Doonesbury.” Others update only on weekdays. Some are just on Sundays. Others solely on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Which meant that most days I knew I would just be automatically closing some of those tabs.</p>
<p>In and of itself, I could handle the sheer <em>onerous</em> nature of having to close some tabs—the horror!—but there was another more bothersome annoyance. Many of the comics I read are served up through one of the major comics syndicate websites, GoComics. Several years ago, the site changed its interface so that when you go to the main landing page for a comic—say, again, <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/">Calvin &amp; Hobbes</a>—all you would see is a crop of the day’s comic, which you would then have to click to get to the full comic. That meant every comic I read on that site now required an extra, obnoxious step.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gocomics-calvinandhobbes.png?resize=1360%2C855&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This page basically seems to designed to force you to look at a bunch of ads before getting to the content you want (and it runs half the content in the bargain!)</figcaption></figure><p>Boy, this sounds like a job for automation, if there ever was one.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I finally had the impetus to create a shortcut to streamline this process. After mucking with it on and off during various beta updates, I finally ended up with a version that works pretty well <em>and</em> is easily customizable, meaning I can share it with people.</p>
<p>The whole process ended up being more complicated than I initially thought, for a few reasons. First, though I’ve spent more time in Shortcuts recently, I’m still in a scenario of having to fit my programming knowledge (derived mainly from my time as a PHP developer) into the available receptacle (creating Shortcuts), which is, at times, very much a round-peg, square-hole situation.<sup id="fnref-12693-loops"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-loops" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> Second, some of the iOS 14 beta releases had glitches that interfered with Shortcuts, meaning I had to set the shortcut aside until the next release came along.</p>
<p>But what I ultiamtely ended up with is <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/317da8bd3dc54dfc8d9ab324237e08b1">this shortcut</a>: It takes a list of comics, each of which has an associated schedule and a URL. When it’s launched, it checks to see which of the comics have the current day in their regular schedule, then compiles a list which it opens in tabs in Safari. And, as a bonus, if the comic in question is hosted on GoComics, it automatically edits the URL so that you’re taken <em>directly</em> to the full comic, rather than making you click through.<sup id="fnref-12693-image"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-image" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps nobody else in the world has this particular habit. Who knows? But maybe someone out there will get something out of this shortcut. If so, you can download it at the link above and may it increase your comic reading habits a thousandfold.</p>

The highlight of that period was probably about 20 years ago, and I’ve given up on all but a few. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-abandoned"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>

Figuring out how to loop through a multi-dimensional dictionary in Shortcuts almost broke my brain, especially as this is something I know how to do in PHP and could implement almost without thinking about it. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-loops"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>

If I were being perhaps a little more…subversive, I would be scraping for just the comic images on the page. But that seems to take this to a different level. <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12693-image"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>

<p>I noticed yesterday that the population in a zip code near me is roughly equal to the zip code itself. So I wondered:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Does any zip code equal its population?</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a silly question. A zip code isn&#8217;t a quantity. Populations are always changing. Zip code boundaries are always changing. Etc.</p>
<p>The answer, according to the data I had on hand, is almost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Smallest absolute error: Zip code 00674 has population 672.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Smallest relative error: Zip code 42301 has population 42319.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had to learn some of the intricacies of zip codes in the course of my work on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>. I found out that zip codes are more complicated than I ever would have thought.</p>
<p>For one thing, the US Census doesn&#8217;t exactly report data by zip code but by zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) for reasons that make sense but are too complicated to get into here. This is another reason why the question posed here is fuzzy; we don&#8217;t know the populations of zip codes unless they coincide with ZCTAs.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Several people have told me they expected this post to be an existence argument, such as saying by the pigeon hole principle some zip code has to equal its population. That&#8217;s not the case, at least for real, populated US zip codes. (Though Andrew Gelman pointed out that 00000 is not populated, so there&#8217;s that.)</p>
<p>Let <em>P</em> be a population size with <em>n</em> zip codes and assume all zip codes have to be populated. If <em>P</em> = <em>n</em> and one of the zip codes must be numbered 1, then some zip code must equal its population. But other than trivial cases like that, it&#8217;s easy to avoid any equalities between zip codes and their populations.</p>
<p>A more interesting question goes in the opposite direction: is it possible that <em>every</em> zip code equals its population? Clearly not if <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> + 1)/2 &gt; <em>P</em> because the left side is the minimum population possible with <em>n</em> zip codes, each equal to its non-zero population. But it turns out that <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> + 1)/2 ≤ <em>P</em> is sufficient: put one person in zip codes 1 through <em>n</em>-1 and let <em>k</em> = <em>P</em> &#8211; <em>n</em>(<em>n</em>-1) be the number of remaining people. Put them all in zip code <em>k. </em>Since <em>k</em> ≥ <em>n</em>-1, <em>k</em> is a zip code that hasn&#8217;t been used before.</p>
