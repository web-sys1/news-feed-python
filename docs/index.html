    <p><a href="https://www.hakmem.org/">HAKMEM</a> Item 123 gives two plots, both images of concentric circles under functions given by power series with rapidly thinning terms [1]. The first is the function</p>
<p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_eqn1.svg" width="109" height="48" alt="f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^{n!}}{n!}" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color:white" /></p>
<p>and the second is</p>
<p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_eqn2.svg" width="110" height="48" alt=" g(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^{2^n}}{2^n}" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color:white" /></p>
<p>The lower limits of summation are not given in the original. I assumed at first the sums began at <em>n</em> = 0, but my plots didn&#8217;t match the original until I set the lower index to begin at <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
<p>Here are the plots. First, the image of the circles of radius 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, and 1 under <em>f</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot1.png" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-medium" /></p>
<p>Next, the images of the circles of radius 1/8, 2/8, &hellip;, 8/8 under <em>g</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_plot2.png" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-medium" /></p>
<p>Note that the images of concentric circles are smooth, concentric, not self-intersecting for small radii. As the radii get larger, the images of the circles start to intersect. And when the radius is 1, the images are rough and reminiscent of Mandelbrot sets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Python code that produced the plots.</p>
<pre>
    from math import factorial
    from numpy import linspace, exp, pi
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def f(thin, z):
        return sum(z**thin(n)/thin(n)
                   for n in range(1, 12))
    
    theta = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000)
    
    for r in [0.5, 0.75, 0.875, 1]:
        z = f(factorial, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag)
    plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
    plt.title("f(z)")
    plt.show()
    plt.close()
    
    for n in range(8):
        r = (n+1)/8
        theta = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000)
        z = f(lambda n: 2**n, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag)
    plt.title("g(z)")
    plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
    plt.show()

    </p></div>
    <p>A year ago, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/?utm_source=feed">published a piece</a> in the print magazine about that long-standing object of American fascination, the Roman Empire. Usually, and usefully, Americans have over the centuries looked to Rome for guidance on how their nation could avoid the predictable slide from republic to empire to conquest and dissolution. My favorite in this genre is the wonderful 2007 book <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/are-we-rome-cullen-murphy/1111827041"><em>Are We Rome?</em></a>, by my friend (and <em>Atlantic</em> colleague) Cullen Murphy.</p><p>But for last year’s piece I discussed some other books, arguing that what happened to Rome <em>after</em> the fall of the Western empire is what Americans should be studying. Especially in this era when central government—leadership on the imperial scale, you might say—was faltering, and when our counterparts to the Roman provinces (that is, our cities and states and regions) were by comparison so much more practical-minded and functional.</p><p>My friend <a href="http://www.ericschnurer.com/">Eric Schnurer</a>, who has worked in and written extensively (including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/eric-schnurer/?utm_source=feed">for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>) about governance at all levels, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote a response</a> that highlighted some additional areas of useful comparison between the America of our time and the Rome of yesteryear. Now he is back with an extension of his argument. He calls this dispatch “From Sulla to Sullen: What the Fall of the Roman Republic Tells Us About Where Trump Is Taking Us.” I think it is instructive and worth reading, and with his permission I quote it below.</p><p>Schnurer began by directing attention away from the end of the empire, and instead to:</p><blockquote>
<p>… the approaching decline of the Roman Republic, a half-millennium earlier.  As I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote last year</a>, “the increasing economic inequality, the increasing political polarization, the total eclipse of ‘the greater good’ by what we’d call ‘special interests,’ the turn toward political violence” all  looked “a lot like the present moment to me.” I was thinking of the period dominated by the attempted reforms of the Gracchi brothers—a tag-team somewhat analogous to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren —roughly a century before the Republic’s ultimate fall into dictatorship.</p>

<p>I hardly expected then that within about <em>half a year</em>, Donald Trump would manage to fast-forward the country through <em>half a</em> <em>century</em> of Roman history, to the doorstep of the Civil Wars that destroyed what little was left of Republican Rome.</p>

<p>Of course, no historical analogy is exact. The collapse of the Republic was brought on by a combination of structural flaws in its politics and governance, and the self-serving ambitions of ruthless individuals that exploited them. While the causes were many, inter-related, and complex, at their root was a system that defied any notion of the common good and was devoid of political means to resolve rather than exacerbate division.</p>

<p>The Republic was the creation of a tight-knit oligarchy that had overthrown the preceding monarchy and, as a result, held a deep-seated determination never again to allow any one individual to accumulate so much power as to overawe all others.  </p>

<p>The solution was not so much a separation of powers, as we conceive of it—officials simultaneously played executive, legislative and even judicial roles—as a vast multiplicity of individuals who could hold their posts only once, and for only a year. But this was no “citizen’s republic”:  A small coterie of privileged families held almost all these offices and voting was severely limited.</p>

<p>Moreover, the term <em>republic</em>—from the Latin for “a thing of the public”—was meant to distinguish it from a monarchy, which was essentially the personal property of the ruler in which other people simply happened to live. But the Roman Republic was more like what we might think of as a “publicly held corporation” and, essentially, treated as private property. Officials used public office to profit personally and directly (and openly).</p>

<p>Of course, it takes money to make money, so only the very wealthy could afford to pursue these rewards because, along the way, they were expected personally to pay for the lavish spectacles, such as the famous gladiatorial games, that sated the public, as well as major public works and public building projects. The Roman state, in short, while ostensibly “public,” had long since been thoroughly privatized.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This state was essentially an increasingly imperial business enterprise, in the guise of a government. The expanding conquests, which were basically run as profit centers, undercut the working populations in the city through a growing influx of slave labor, and drove rural residents off their land through collapsing agricultural prices due to burgeoning grain imports—the automation and offshoring of their day.</p>

<p>These developments nonetheless personally benefited the wealthy Senatorial and governing elite that wielded government power increasingly for the sole private benefit of its members. This led to spiraling social tensions that, when they flared into violence, were resolved through grudging concessions rather than fundamental—and democratizing—changes.   </p>

<p>The “radical” Warren-esque reforms of the Gracchis, who themselves were highly patrician, arguably aimed to save their own class from themselves as much as saving the Republic, by creating economic safety valves not unlike the patrician Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal at the depths of the Great Depression. The elites were too selfish, or shortsighted, or both, to see the wisdom—resulting in a violent uprising of the dispossessed known as “the Social War.” Conceptions of a greater good shared broadly amongst a frontier people who had thrown off their king, and came together especially in times of external threat, had long since melted away before the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Politics could no longer bridge the divides, because the threat did not come from without: The enemy was the other within.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>In this <em>res public</em> largely eviscerated of any sense of the “public,” politics and government increasingly degenerated further into the personal.  Wealthy politicians vied for, and alternated in power, with the support of their own personal parties, armed factions, and the communications media of the day (Julius Caesar, with his <em>Commentaries</em> on his subjugation of Gaul, was a master of this). By a half-century after the Gracchis’ reforms were beaten back, extremely different visions of governing structure, social issues, and economics eventually confronted each other for power in the form of essentially personalized states built largely around either Gaius Marius or Lucius Cornelius Sulla.</p>

<p>And that might be where we find ourselves today. While the political parallels are far from perfect, Marius, hardly a blameless figure, personified the cause of the <em>populares</em>—what we might think of as more-or-less progressive, advocating for an expanded democracy and economic redistribution. Sulla, a patrician who indulged a fairly libertine, sometimes vulgar, lifestyle even throughout his several marriages, was nonetheless the champion of the economic, social and political conservatives, prevailed and eventually became dictator.</p>

<p>While Roman politics had long been a nasty affair, Sulla was the first to institutionalize “proscription”—the practice of declaring your opponents “enemies of the state” and thereby licensing open-hunting season on them. He also became the first ever to violate perhaps the most deeply held norm of the Republic’s unwritten constitution—that no general was ever to lead armed forces across the sacred boundary, the <em>pomerium</em>, of Rome itself—which set the precedent for Julius Caesar’s later, and more famous, crossing of the Rubicon that all but marked the end of the Republic, and Rome’s imperfect democracy, for good.</p>

<p>Now, within the last month, President Trump has sent armed forces into American cities—but not the regular armed forces, as he has mooted in the past. He didn’t call up the National Guard, as presidents normally do when responding to emergencies or civil unrest: With military leaders and some troops themselves publicly expressing discomfort after their use against peaceful protests in Washington, DC, Trump needed to find forces more personally loyal to himself—and he did so in the Customs and Border Patrol—outside any existing branch of the military, responding directly to his agenda, arguably beyond his constitutional authority, and targeting dissent ...</p>

<p>But, as is often the case with Trump, creation of this new praetorian guard can alternatively be understood as essentially a business, rather than an ideological, development—simply a further, if more disturbing, extension of his privatization and personalization of the federal government. The fact that this new model army displays no government agency’s insignia on its personnel or vehicles—relying instead on widely available camouflage rather than government uniforms—means that private militias and vigilantes can easily join forces with it, or even take actions on their own, indistinguishable from these new-fangled government irregulars. As I <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2017-02-07/donald-trump-and-steve-bannon-will-leave-america-hollow">predicted when Trump first took office</a>, the distinction between public and private sectors is melting away before our very eyes even as to the deployment of legitimate force that, ever since the great sociologist Max Weber, has been seen as the defining element of the state.</p>

<p>Coming as it does at the same time that Trump has declared, even more unmistakably than in the past, that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/20/politics/2020-election-transition-trump/index.html">he is not inclined to honor the election results if he loses</a> and then <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/trump-postpone-election/614755/?utm_source=feed">floated delaying them</a>, the creation of what is essentially his own personal army raises the possibility that Trump eventually may create, well, his own personal government.</p>

<p>Many have expressed concerns for some time that Trump would attempt to remain in office if he were defeated, and might rally armed militias to his cause (I’ve raised this concern myself since the night Trump was elected) … But even if he does leave, the likely Trump post-presidency that fits best with his personality and history—not to mention that of the Romans—may be even more troubling and dangerous.</p>

<p>Trump, if he were to lose, might well leave the White House—he never liked the building to begin with, and doesn’t like the actual work of the presidency—but never concede that he lost. He might not be the real President anymore … but he could play one on TV. If he continued to insist that he were the actual, legitimate President of the United States, there can be little doubt that tens of millions of Americans would believe him. And unlike your average crank, Trump has the resources and ability to turn this into a 24/7 TV reality program through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-allies-explore-buyout-of-conservative-news-channel-one-america-news-network-11578696767">his own television network</a>, even further to the right and more reliably sycophantic than Fox—which he reportedly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/10/17/report-trump-may-start-tv-network/92280290/">was considering launching had he not, unexpectedly, won the 2016 election</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine an alternative President, with at least as much media reach as the one actually in the White House, with an unshakably devoted following of perhaps as much as one-third of the country, and perhaps even his own private armed forces—Sulla with a TV station funded by his fellow reactionary patricians, with his own camo-clad stormtroopers picking up and disappearing <em>populare</em> protestors in unmarked vans—and the present looks even more like the late Republic than when I wrote about this less than a year ago. If this occurs, the country would descend into dueling polities, dueling realities, and dueling war zones.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Of course, there are always alternatives: As dysfunctional as the Republic had become, Rome didn’t necessarily need a Caesar. But it <em>did</em> need a modernization of its pre-imperial governance technology—a standing bureaucracy and a streamlined executive to carry out the legislative will would have improved on the existing multi-headed oligarchy at least as well as the succession of terrible emperors did. And a peaceful mechanism for resolving the increasingly disparate interests of Rome’s increasingly disparate and unwieldy empire—broadened and meaningful democracy, for instance, along with progressive economic policies and perhaps a Plebeian Lives Matter movement—might have averted a half-millennium of dictatorship dominated not by orderly succession but factional assassinations and coups until even the Empire eventually conceded it couldn’t manage the job and simply partitioned itself.</p>

<p>We face similar choices today. History isn’t destiny. But it <em>is</em> a warning.   </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8">Ben Gilbert, reporting yesterday for Business Insider</a> (italic emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This September, Microsoft plans to launch a major coup in the
video game business: The world’s first game streaming service with
a built-in library, Netflix-style. For $15 a month, you’ll be able
to stream over 100 games to smartphones and tablets — but it
won’t be available on Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><em>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because
Apple isn’t able to review each game that’s available through
Game Pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness">controversy over Basecamp’s Hey app</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Tim Cook being called to testify at an antitrust Congressional hearing</a> regarding App Store policies, and given the high profile of Xbox Game Pass, it’s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200806/p45#a200806p45">has gotten a lot of attention</a>, almost all of it focused on taking the italicized paragraph from Business Insider at its word. But that’s Ben Gilbert’s interpretation, not a quote from Apple. Gilbert’s interpretation is not an unfair or sensationalized take on Apple’s statement, but it’s adding a “because” that Apple did not state.</p>

<p>Here is Apple’s statement to Business Insider, apparently in its entirety. Apple seemingly sent this statement <em>only</em> to Business Insider, which itself is a bit unusual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for
customers to discover and download apps, and a great business
opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all
apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are
intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing
field to developers.</p>

<p>Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of
developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App
Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users
over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running this statement through my Applespeak-to-English decoder ring, what I hear is not that they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game separately. What I hear is that game streaming services are not allowed in the iOS App Store. Period, full stop. I don’t even think this has anything to do with whether Microsoft offers in-app subscriptions, or whether those subscriptions get a discount from the standard 70/30 split for the first year. I think Apple’s stance is that game streaming services like Microsoft’s xCloud project are simply verboten.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-07">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2.7">App Store guideline 4.2.7</a>, “Remote Desktop Clients”, seemingly makes this clear, too — it’s a written rule, not an unwritten one. This rule is why <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about">Steam Link</a> is in the App Store and Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia are not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is
    a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the
    user, and both the host device and client must be connected on
    a local and LAN-based network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like this: Business Insider asked Apple why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass. Apple didn’t say why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass, and instead gave a non-answer answer by describing what they do allow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submitting games individually and appearing in charts and search — presumably App Store charts and search — is just an obfuscated way of saying that native iOS game apps are allowed in the iOS App Store. Well, duh. Everyone is distracted by the interpretation that Apple won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game. It is a nonsensical justification, no doubt about that. But the comparison to Netflix or Spotify is beside the point. Of course Apple doesn’t and can’t review every movie on Netflix or every song on Spotify. But if you think about it, they <em>could</em> review every game on Xbox Game Pass. Even if it’s 100 games, they could look at them all. I’m sure they could find quite a few volunteers among the App Store reviewer corps to spend the time to play these games thoroughly.</p>

<p>The point is that streaming video and music services are allowed in the App Store; streaming software (games or otherwise) is not, unless it works over the web. <em>Apple just doesn’t want to say that.</em> Here, in my opinion, is how this conversation is best decoded:</p>

<p><strong>Business Insider</strong>: <em>Why are game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass not allowed in the App Store?</em></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong>: <em>Native iPhone games are allowed in the App Store. Native iPhone games are good because we review them individually, and they appear in App Store charts and search results.</em></p>

<p>It’s a perfect example of the difference between bullshit and a lie. Every word in Apple’s statement is true, but not a word of it answers why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass or any other cloud game streaming service.</p>

<p>Apple would have been much better off saying nothing at all than offering this bullshit non-answer answer, that in fact was so easily and reasonably misconstrued. And, purely as a guess on my part, I think Apple realized this, which is why they didn’t send this statement to any other outlet and haven’t added a word of clarification since.</p>

<p>I really hope it’s <em>not</em> about the money. I mean let’s face it, no matter what the story is here, it’s sad in some way. Microsoft has made something technically impressive and cool and fun, and millions of Xbox-playing iOS users would love to play these games on their iPhones and iPads and but they can’t because of some sort of business or strategic shit that’s between Apple and Microsoft. But if it’s really just a dispute about goddamn money — between, of all companies, two of the richest in the history of the world — man, that’s just tawdry. It’s just two <em>corporations</em> fighting over one more stream of money neither even knows what to do with atop the Scrooge McDuckian mountains of cash they each already have flooding into their coffers each day. That’s business, but that’s a stale saltine of a story.</p>

<p>But what if it’s <em>not</em> Apple being a dick about money? What if it’s Apple being a dick about control?</p>

<p>That’s not cold and dry — that’s a goddamn sizzling hot juicy steak of a story. That’s <em>personal</em>. For one thing it would explain the pissy, petulant tone of Microsoft’s statement. Maybe Microsoft went into this whole endeavor gearing up for a knockdown drag-out knife-fight negotiation about how exactly to split the money, and Apple just went stone cold <a href="https://youtu.be/wPmTp9up26w?t=87">Michael Corleone on them</a>: “<em>You can have our answer now, if you like. Our offer is this: nothing. Not even the 30 percent fee for the gaming subscription, which we would appreciate if you put up your ass.</em>” The idea being, in this scenario, that Apple has something Microsoft needs, Microsoft has nothing to offer in return that Apple wants, and so Microsoft just has to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZhj7rPPzxg">sit there grooving on it</a>, stuck with a premium paid subscription service that’s only available on the low-rent mobile platform <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">where people don’t pay for things</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is clearly being a dick to Microsoft about <em>something</em> here, and if it’s platform control not money, well by god at least there’s some delicious poetic justice at play. That’d be a veritable vintage bottle of wine being uncorked. Not having any control over the world’s most lucrative computing platform and wanting something from the company that does — and which has a real taste for exerting its dictatorial control over said platform in mercurial fashion — would fucking suck, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

    <p>I wound up looking into the etymology of “cherry-pick” while writing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/07/instagram-hashtag-bug">this post</a> earlier today, and I’m simply astounded by this note from Merriam-Webster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first known use of <em>cherry-pick</em> was in 1965.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m shocked that <em>cherry-pick</em> is so recent. I figured it was not just old but maybe <em>really</em> old, centuries old. Is this right?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> The Online Etymology Dictionary <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/cherry-pick">pegs <em>cherry-pick</em>’s origin as 1959</a> — a little earlier, but not much.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Anu Garg, founder and writer of the excellent Wordsmith and its A.Word.A.Day newsletter, <a href="https://wordsmith.org/words/cherry-pick.html">pegged <em>cherry-pick</em>’s earliest documented use as 1966</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> The other OED <a href="https://twitter.com/howe/status/1291910907090448384">has an instance of “cherry-picker” as a railroad industry term for a switchman from 1940</a>, which usage explains why the idiom is about cherries — the switch lights were red.</p>

    <p>A couple of people have asked for an update of a chart I put up <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/06/if-covid-19-cases-are-going-up-why-is-the-death-rate-going-down/">a few weeks ago</a> comparing the COVID-19 case rate with the death rate. Here it is:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857971"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857971" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_case_vs_death_august_7.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="616"></figure>
<p>During the first round of COVID-19, the death rate started to decline about two weeks after the case rate began falling. If the same thing happens this time around, deaths have already peaked and will start to decline in about a week or so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this is what will happen. There have been too many surprises already in the COVID-19 numbers, and the actual death rate will depend a lot on how seriously everyone is taking the recommended countermeasures (masks, social distancing, etc.). I can&#8217;t predict that—and neither can anyone else—which means I can&#8217;t predict the death rate trend either.</p>
<p>Still, if the second round of COVID-19 is like the first round, late July would have been a decent baseline guess for peak deaths—which turned out to be the case—and mid-August is our best guess for the start of the decline.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running it on my secondary Mac, and while there are rough edges, overall, I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time with it considering the design. This has caused me to re-read <a href="https://512pixels.net/2014/10/os-x-yosemite-review/">my review of OS X Yosemite,</a> which was the first release with the &#8220;flatter&#8221; design we still see today in Catalina. In it, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While this new version of OS X is structurally the same as all of its predecessors, there’s not much left of that original Aqua look left.</p>
<p>  Apple didn’t go all iOS 7 on OS X’s ass, though.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That may have finally happened with Big Sur. There&#8217;s a big emphasis on text and large white areas that used to have more color to them. This change is going to be a wild one to watch.</p>

    <p>Simon Sharwood, writing for The Register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toshiba has finally and formally exited the laptop business</p>

<p>Toshiba has made laptops since 1985 and claims to have been the
first to make a mass-market computer in the now-familiar clamshell
form factor. By the 1990s the company was producing solid
workhorses in the Satellite range and started to make meaningful
stretches of mobile work possible with the small, thin and light
Portégé range.</p>

<p>Those products saw Toshiba lead the world for laptop market share
through the late 1990s and retain that position for much of the
2000s. Even as the PC market consolidated in that decade, Toshiba
was often ranked among the top five of all PC vendors despite only
ever dabbling in desktops.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far
the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel
processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity,
next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with
four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option
for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD
camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A summary of what’s new:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Intel CPUs and AMD graphic cards</li>
<li>SSDs across the line, including options for 4 TB and 8 TB</li>
<li>TrueTone</li>
<li>Nano-texture display finish, like the Pro Display XDR ($500)</li>
<li>RAM options up to 128 GB (base configuration is still 8 GB; the high-end 64 and 128 GB options cost $1,000 and $2,600 more, respectively)</li>
<li>1080p FaceTime camera with better low-light performance, and a “studio quality” microphone array like the current MacBook Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>The 21-inch iMac has not been updated, although the base model configurations now have SSDs instead of Fusion Drives. There remains a 1 TB Fusion Drive build-to-order configuration for the 21-inch iMac, which I believe is now the last spinning hard disk Apple sells.</p>

<p>The iMac Pro has not been updated either, although the $5,000 base model is now the 10-core Xeon W configuration, and the old 8-core base model is gone.</p>

    <p>Craig Silverman and Ryan Mac, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individuals that spoke out about the apparent special treatment of
right-wing pages have also faced consequences. In one case, a
senior Facebook engineer collected multiple instances of
conservative figures receiving unique help from Facebook
employees, including those on the policy team, to remove
fact-checks on their content. His July post was removed because it
violated the company’s “respectful communication policy.” After
the engineer’s post was removed, the related internal “tasks” he’d
cited as examples of the alleged special treatment were made
private and inaccessible to employees, according to a Workplace
post from another employee. […]</p>

<p>The engineer joined the company in 2016 and most recently worked
on Instagram. He left the company on Wednesday. One employee on an
internal thread seen by BuzzFeed News said that they received
permission from the engineer to say that the dismissal “was not
voluntary.” […]</p>

<p>News of his firing caused some Facebook employees to say that they
now fear speaking critically about the company in internal
discussions. One person said they were deleting old posts and
comments, while another said this was “hardly the first time the
respectful workplace guidelines have been used to snipe a
prominent critic of company policies/ethics.”</p>

<p>“[He] was a conscience of this company, and a tireless voice for
us doing the right thing,” said another employee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having a conscience does seem like a mismatch for working at Facebook.</p>

<p>This is really an astonishing story, and it’s effectively buried a few hundred words into what’s really a <em>separate</em> but also alarming story about Facebook employees asking Zuckerberg what Facebook is going to do if Trump uses the platform to dispute the election results.</p>

    <p>Ryan Mac, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier this week, a search on Instagram for #JoeBiden would have
surfaced nearly 390,000 posts tagged with the former vice
president’s name along with related hashtags selected by the
platform’s algorithm. Users searching Instagram for #JoeBiden
might also see results for #joebiden2020, as well as pro-Trump
hashtags like #trump2020landslide and #democratsdestroyamerica.</p>

<p>A similar search for #DonaldTrump on the platform, however,
provided a totally different experience. Besides showing 7 million
posts tagged with the president’s name, Instagram did not present
any related hashtags that would have pushed users toward different
content or promoted alternative viewpoints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it was an honest bug, maybe not. But Facebook’s institutional credibility is so low it’s hard to take them at their word. And then there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1291066529031655424">this response from Instagram’s official comms team</a>, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t about politics. Tens of thousands of hashtags were
affected, and your story cherry-picked a handful of those
thousands to fit a sensational narrative. The bug was also not
partisan, as you note #democrats was impacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1291070240533569538">Via Parker Molloy</a>, who notes that this combative tone — expressly impugning Mac’s integrity — is <em>not</em> how Facebook/Instagram has ever responded to accusations of bias against Republicans.</p>

<p>Whatever you think about the purported bug — and as skeptical as I am about Facebook, I actually think there’s a good chance it really was just a bug — this response from their comms teams is the real eye-opener.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also note that Instagram accuses Mac of “cherry-picking” for singling out the Biden/Trump differences. They know those are the only two candidates. How can it be “cherry picking” to compare how Instagram is treating <em>the only two major presidential candidates</em>? What the hell kind of bushel only has two cherries to choose from? And you can’t argue that it was about cherry-picking hashtags, not candidates, when the core hashtags in question were “#JoeBiden” and “#DonaldTrump”.</p>

<p>The Pixel 4A has a one-size-fits-all 5.8-inch display. Google is using a hole-punch for the first time, which allows the screen to go closer to the edges. The bezels are still bigger than what you&rsquo;ll get on a flagship, but they&rsquo;re smaller than many phones at this price point.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Apple silicon announcement, I spoke at length with John Giannandrea, Apple&rsquo;s Senior Vice President for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, as well as with Bob Borchers, VP of Product Marketing. They described Apple&rsquo;s AI philosophy, explained how machine learning drives certain features, and argued passionately for Apple&rsquo;s on-device AI/ML strategy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand this perception of bigger models in data centers somehow are more accurate, but it&rsquo;s actually wrong. It&rsquo;s actually technically wrong. It&rsquo;s better to run the model close to the data, rather than moving the data around. And whether that&rsquo;s location data&mdash;like what are you doing&mdash; [or] exercise data&mdash;what&rsquo;s the accelerometer doing in your phone&mdash;it&rsquo;s just better to be close to the source of the data, and so it&rsquo;s also privacy preserving.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My mother has five cats: Tillamook, Luna, and the three stripeys. Luna is shy around strangers, but my sister and I have been around enough over the past few weeks that she&#8217;s finally gotten used to us. Luring her with plates of food helped too. In any case, she now hangs around inside the house sometimes, and she has decided that Tillamook is her favorite uncle. She just loves curling up with him, and Tilly doesn&#8217;t mind either.</p>

    <p>Today brings a new study of COVID-19 with some interesting results. The basic question is whether big, dense cities are more vulnerable to outbreaks than smaller towns and rural areas. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1777891">The authors come to two conclusions:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>High <em>population</em> cities have higher infection rates and higher death rates.</li>
<li>However, high <em>density</em> cities have lower death rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the worst possible place to live is a big city with low density. These are mostly found out west: Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, etc. The best place to live would be a relatively small city with high density: San Francisco, Boston, Washington DC, and so forth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much this matters since most of us can&#8217;t move, but at least it gives you some idea of how dangerous your current residence is.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0977648133/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5 Year Diary by Tamara Shopsin</a> ($25)<br />
The first pick that I have is a little 5-year diary, designed by Tamara Shopsin. I just write down what happened at each day, who I talked to, and I usually end up recording what food I cooked because I&#8217;m big into cooking. I have a log for almost every year of my life. But this is the first time I&#8217;ve really gotten into a five-year journal and I love it. I love this one in particular because it&#8217;s just very simply designed, it&#8217;s very classic. It&#8217;s small, and there&#8217;s just enough room to write a couple of sentences. It&#8217;s very easy to maintain every single day because there&#8217;s no big commitment. And I&#8217;m four years into this book now, so it&#8217;s really starting to pay off because when I write down what happened, then I can look back and see what happened on that day, three years back. And for me that&#8217;s really fun. I think it plays to my natural bent toward nostalgia.  I particularly like the clean and functional design of this journal. So many journals are over-designed.</p>
<p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/fiskarsrotary.jpg" alt="fiskarsrotary" width="500" height="197" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36793" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GHGT72S/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fiskars Titanium Rotary Cutter</a> ($20)<br />
I have really gotten into sewing lately. I&#8217;ve always sewn, but just straight-edged things like curtains or a comforter cover. But in the last year I&#8217;ve really gotten into sewing clothing and much more adventurous items. And it&#8217;s cool to be in my mid 50s, learning a whole new world of skills and tools and trying more and more challenging patterns. And then I discovered the Fiskars rotary cutter and you use it along with a straight edge and it&#8217;s a game changer. It completely just changed the way I work. I&#8217;m a fairly precise person, so just the ability to cut patterns really precisely and cut things exactly to precise inches, which is really more of a challenge to do with sheers where you&#8217;re lifting the fabric and it shifts around more. With this you&#8217;re pressing it down with a straight edge and just running that nice titanium blade along the edge of the straight edge and you get just perfect results. There are a number of other sewing tools I’ve recently discovered and delight in, such as a dedicated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CV7LD6F/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invisible-zipper foot</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B072N2ZPGC/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread snip</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YZ8N46/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seam gauge</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000W5GFIO/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pattern weights</a>, but the rotary cutters have had the biggest impact on my process.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FSGUAG/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Schaedler Precision Rules</a> ($30)<br />
I have had mine for 30 years. And if a ruler could be sexy, this one&#8217;s pretty sexy to me. It&#8217;s just what it sounds like. It&#8217;s a super precise ruler, and it&#8217;s printed on a very thin translucent plastic. I have a set of two of them, and the one I&#8217;m looking at now has inches along one edge down to one 64th of an inch. And it has metric down to half millimeters. And then there&#8217;s picas down the middle, for the first 12, every point is marked. I have another one that has picas along the edge. As a book designer, I am partial to the pica ruler, which has found steady use throughout my career.</p>

<a href="https://www.luglife.com/collections/crossbody/products/moped?variant=19058512920649" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moped Crossbody Bag by Lug</a> ($70)<br />
I have been using the Moped bag as my “everyday” purse for at least 10 years. It’s just the right size&#8211;big enough to hold everything I need for a day (even a light sweater) but not so big that everything is swimming in it. But it’s the POCKETS that I love! So many pockets! There’s a back pocket that fits my iPad perfectly, a handy front pocket for my phone, and a side pocket that I use for glasses, a water bottle, or a compact umbrella. I have a whole system. They come in a lot of different fabrics, but I like the simple gray heather. And it&#8217;s not fancy. I have fancy or evening purses, but I&#8217;m not a purse person. People pay a lot of money for purses. I&#8217;m shocked. This one&#8217;s very affordable.</p>
<p>About <strong><a href="https://cookingwithrockstars.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cooking with Rockstars</a></strong>:<br />
Years ago, starting in 2002, I started doing video interviews with indie rock stars about food. It was called Cooking With Rockstars, and I had the site up from maybe 2002 to 2008. Then the site went offline and I just never came around to getting it started again. There was always something else to do and that was always lower priority. But recently, I was talking with Jeffrey Zeldman who works at Automattic and he gave me the assistance of a team at WordPress who built it for me and we revived it. So it&#8217;s back online. I&#8217;m able to rerelease all of the old videos. I have a whole bunch that were in the can that were never released. They&#8217;re old, but they&#8217;re newly released. And I might, after you can actually do things like visit people again, might do a few new interviews coming up. So I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>

    <p>So how did we do on the jobs front in July? Obviously we&#8217;re in new territory these days, but I think the answer is &#8220;meh&#8221;:</p>

<p>The BLS reports that we gained 1.8 million jobs, which is less than half what we gained in June. On the unemployment front, there were 6.3 million fewer workers who had been unemployed for 5-14 weeks, but 4.6 million more workers who had been unemployed for 15-26 weeks. The industries with the biggest gains were leisure, temp services, and retail.</p>
<p>On the earnings front, the news was all bad: hourly wages of blue-collar workers were down about 5 percent on an annualized basis. Wages for retail workers were down 3.4 percent from June, or 42 percent on an annualized basis. That&#8217;s not a typo. It would appear that retailers took the opportunity of COVID-19 to slash pay for their workers. Isn&#8217;t that lovely?</p>

<p class="">Yesterday marked the release of <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-version-5"><span>Day One, version 5</span></a>. There are several new features of note: </p><p class=""><strong>The Today View</strong></p><p class="">Previously called the Activity Feed, the new Today View ties in other data available to Day One, like location data, calendar events, and daily photos. If you tap on a calendar event, it opens a new entry with that event title as the Day One entry title. Clever.</p><p class=""><strong>PDF Export</strong></p><p class="">The PDF Export feature has a lot more options than it used to. You can export out of a specific journal but only entries with one tag, but no entries with a different tag. Want to export as CSV? It does that now too. It opens up data export.</p><p class=""><strong>The Media Picker</strong></p><p class="">Getting photos and videos into your journal just got easier. </p><p class="">They’ve also added Sign in with Apple, greatly simplifying sign in on your devices. I’m testing out several journaling workflows right now, and this update came just as I’m testing out Day One in earnest—more on this to come.</p><p class=""> </p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>For the past several days, I’ve been annoying my family with a shortcut. If there are people in your life you want to annoy, you might want to use it. And apart from the annoyance value, it has some Shortcuts programming techniques that I want to memorialize for future use.</p>
<p>My daughter has a dog named Daisy, and on a per-kilobyte basis, she is the biggest topic of conversation in the family texts. There are lots of texts about Daisy, and most of them are photos of her. Even so, there’s never enough Daisy, so I wrote a shortcut to amplify the Daisy content. It takes a single picture of Daisy,</p>
<p><img alt="Daisy single" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Daisy%20single.jpg" title="Daisy single" width="50%"/></p>
<p>and makes a grid (or <em>small multiple</em>, as Tufte would have it) of Daisys.</p>
<p><img alt="Untinted Daisy" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Untinted%20Daisy.jpg" title="Untinted Daisy" width="80%"/></p>
<p>As an option, I can apply a random tint to the component images.</p>
<p><img alt="Tinted Daisy" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Tinted%20Daisy.jpg" title="Tinted Daisy" width="80%"/></p>
<p>I’ve called this shortcut <span class="menu">Warhol</span> for what should be <a href="https://www.artetrama.com/blogs/news/about-andy-warhols-sunday-b-morning-marilyn-monroe-series">obvious reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Using the shortcut is simple. Upon launching Warhol, you’re asked to choose an image from Photos.<sup id="fnref:share"><a href="#fn:share" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> When that’s done, you’re asked to choose the grid size:</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing grid size" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Choosing%20grid%20size.png" title="Choosing grid size" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Finally, you’re asked if you want the images tinted or not.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c7d2a77c999349608e6b4e0c4fc2b6e3">download the shortcut</a> and install it. As we’ll see in the description, Warhol does require a bit of external setup: a Photos album named Tints that contains 1×1 PNG images of a single color. Here’s what my Tints album looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Tints album" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200806-Tints%20album.jpg" title="Tints album" width="50%"/></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/downloads/Tints.zip">download this zip file</a> of my tints, but don’t feel restricted to these colors. Warhol will work with whatever you put in the Tints album. The only restriction—unless you change the Warhol source code—is that the album must be named Tints.</p>
<p>Here are the steps of Warhol:</p>

<p>The numerical trick in choosing the sizes is to come up with a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 that is the width you want for the final image (ignoring the 1-pixel separator lines). This will have to be a multiple of 120, which is the least common multiple of those numbers. I chose a final image size of 3840, which I sometimes think is too large, but I do like to zoom in on the individual images and still have decent detail. If you don’t want to use storage space and bandwidth as profligately as I do, choose a smaller multiple of 120 (1200? 2400?) and divide that by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 to get the <code>width</code>s.</p>
<p>It’s not obvious how to use a variable as the repetition count in a Repeat loop, as is done in Steps 7 and 13. When you first add a Repeat step, you’re given a count that you can change by tapping the plus or minus buttons that appear when you touch the count button.</p>
<p><img alt="Repeat action" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Repeat%20action.jpg" title="Repeat action" width="50%"/></p>
<p>To use a variable for the count instead of a predefined number, you have to <em>press and hold</em> on the count button. A menu like this will appear,</p>
<p><img alt="Variable repetition menu" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200806-Variable%20repetition%20menu.png" title="Variable repetition menu" width="50%"/></p>
<p>and you’ll be able to choose either a regular variable or a magic variable for the number of repetitions. This is a terrible, undiscoverable design decision. And even after I did discover it (through Googling), I was disappointed to see that the step reads “Repeat count” instead of “Repeat count times.”</p>
<p>You may be wondering where the <code>photos</code> variable in Steps 10 and 14 came from. Basically, it gets made up on the spot and accumulates additional values in a list with each pass through the loop. Here’s the description of <span class="menu">Add to Variable</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appends this action’s input to the specified variable, creating the variable if it does not exist.</p>
<p>This allows you to make a variable hold multiple items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re used to writing in stricter languages, it may bother you that you don’t have to initialize <code>photos</code> with an empty list before adding values to it. If you’ve programmed in Perl, you’ll probably feel right at home.</p>
<p>I often feel guilty about presenting a completed automation, one that I’ve spent a lot of time writing and rewriting to make clearer, more efficient, and more idiomatic to the language in which it’s written. I can assure you that even a silly program like Warhol didn’t spring out fully formed, like Athena from Zeus’s head. It started out both much simpler, in that it handled fewer grid sizes and couldn’t tint the images, and more complicated, in that it didn’t take advantage of some of the niceties of Shortcuts.</p>
<p>For example, the earliest versions of Warhol presented only a few grid sizes and used a repetitive <span class="menu">Choose from Menu</span> section to set the size of the list of images. It was only after I had the basic logic of the shortcut worked out that I switched to using the dictionary of dictionaries to handle the different grid sizes. That change cleaned up a lot of code.</p>
<p>The earlier versions of Warhol also had no logic for resizing the base image before assembling it into a list of images. The <span class="menu">Resize Image</span> step came at the end, only after <span class="menu">Combine Images</span> had created a truly enormous grid image, usually well over 10,000 pixels wide. These early versions often ran <em>very</em> slowly because of all the data they were slinging around.</p>
<p>I don’t consider any of these inefficiencies in code size or running time to be bugs. They were part of my normal process of development:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order my thoughts to understand what the problem is and how to solve it.</li>
<li>Work out some code that implements that solution.</li>
<li>Improve the code to make it tighter, easier to understand, and, if necessary, faster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 usually lead to revisions in what I came up with in Step 1. Working out a solution almost always gives me a better understanding of what the problem really is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Warhol is a solution in search of a problem. It’s the kind of automation I create because I think writing it would be fun and I would learn something in the process. On those terms, it was a success.</p>

<p id="p2">There is far more media I&rsquo;d like to try than I have time for. Between TV shows, movies, music, books and other reading, podcasts, and videogames, the supply of content far outstrips the time I have by an order of magnitude. As a result, I&rsquo;m both picky and often slow to getting around to some media, especially games, which often require a substantial time commitment. The trouble is that it&rsquo;s easy to lose track of games I&rsquo;ve read about, that someone has recommended, and even those that I&rsquo;m in the middle of playing if I can&rsquo;t play regularly.</p>
<p id="p3">I&rsquo;ve approached the problem in a lot of different ways. Text notes are a quick and portable solution but lack detail. Apps designed to track lots of different kinds of media have the benefit of consolidating everything in one place, but often don&rsquo;t accommodate features specific to one kind of media. As a result, I&rsquo;ve recently gravitated to apps that focus on just a single type of media. For videogames, that solution has been <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameTrack</a>, an app that we&rsquo;ve covered in our <a href="https://club.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> newsletters in the past.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/231C5250-34E5-40AA-AEA1-73AE47E8C62E-1596795907551-1596816726626.png" alt="GameTrack&rsquo;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists."><p class="image-caption">GameTrack&rsquo;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists.</p></div>
<p id="p6">The app&rsquo;s tab bar is divided into four sections: Lists, Discover, Activity, and Statistics. GameTrack comes with three default lists: Backlog, Archive, and Wish List. If you subscribe you can add more lists, including ranked lists which are a fun way to pick your favorite games for a system, genre, or franchise. Backlog can be further divided into Now Playing, Play Next, and Collection, and Archive into Finished, Completed, and Abandoned. Wish List is organized by release date and can send you notifications when the games listed there become available. You can pick the platform you&rsquo;re playing on when more than one is available, and games on your lists can be sorted and grouped based on multiple criteria too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9400BCF7-FAC3-4D7D-A23E-99EB22D1033D-1596796253404%202-1596817161692.png" alt="Each game&rsquo;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork."><p class="image-caption">Each game&rsquo;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork.</p></div>
<p id="p8">Each game in a list includes a summary of it pulled from the IGDB database, screenshots, trailers, ratings, release date, genre, critic rating, and other metadata. GameTrack lets you move items between lists and customize entries with alternate artwork from a game&rsquo;s detail view. You can also specify a completion percentage and take notes, which is a handy way to save a URL of a game&rsquo;s review, leave reminders to yourself about what you want to do next in a game, or remember who recommended it. Editable metadata is also accessible from a context menu when you long-press on a game&rsquo;s artwork. I only wish that URLs saved in notes were links that would open in Safari View Controller so I could view them easily in-app.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/FA5300DD-2994-42E6-ADB6-5F76C79078C0-1596796516400-1596817287430.png" alt="The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games."><p class="image-caption">The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games.</p></div>
<p id="p10">The Discover tab allows you to browse games in the IGDB database in categories like Featured, Popular, Upcoming, Recent, Hyped, and Just Added, as well as by platform and a handful of popular franchises. You can also search for games that you want to add to your lists from this tab.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/C7F88E3B-362C-44E5-ADB6-BCC7009B230F-1596797001359-1596817395326.png" alt="Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack."><p class="image-caption">Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack.</p></div>
<p id="p12">The Activity tab serves as a reverse chronological log of games you&rsquo;ve added and to which lists. Here, you&rsquo;ll also find entries of anyone you follow. The feature is powered by Sign In with Apple and syncs across devices. I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time with the Follow feature, but account activity along with lists syncs quickly and reliably and it&rsquo;s easy to find and follow someone if you know what their username is, or if they share a link to their profile with you. It would be nice to discover users you don&rsquo;t know that have similar tastes in games, but that isn&rsquo;t currently possible.</p>
<p id="p13">Despite the discovery limitations, I like the Activity feed a lot because it provides an opportunity to connect with other users to share the games you love. The app also allows you to share individual games using the share sheet, but I&rsquo;d like to share full lists of games with friends and collaborate on lists too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3C4FC41E-45E9-44B0-AC1D-DDA50561DC23-1596797283127-2-1596817800383.png" alt="From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games."><p class="image-caption">From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games.</p></div>
<p id="p15">The final tab is a combination Account and statistics view. From here, you can view followers and who you follow, access settings, and view and share or delete posts in your activity feed. You can also see statistics about the games in your lists broken down by categories like genre, platform, personal ratings, and your history of archiving games. Finally, you can log into your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam accounts to track information from them as well.</p>
<p id="p16">Settings are worth mentioning, too, because GameTrack is highly customizable if you are a subscriber. You can change the app&rsquo;s theme, layout, tint color, and app icon, personalizing it to suit your tastes. I particularly like the new default icon and alternative icons, which have added depth and a touch of realism to the icon&rsquo;s D-pad. Of course, the original version is available too, in multiple colors and special variants. Settings is also where you can manage the details of your GameTrack account, connect your Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam accounts, and export your library data.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4917B2DF-E3B1-4CC0-91C8-D85D8A63971C-1596797572286-1596817596854.png" alt="GameTrack on the iPad."><p class="image-caption">GameTrack on the iPad.</p></div>
<p id="p18">I&rsquo;ve primarily used GameTrack on my iPhone, where the colorful game art tiles and slide-up card interface work especially well for navigating lists and searching for games. The tab bar design doesn&rsquo;t translate as well to the iPad, where it is split across three columns. If my iPad is connected to a keyboard, the keyboard row often covers up GameTrack&rsquo;s tab bar. I can hide the keyboard row, but it still makes navigating GameTrack too difficult. Also, as you switch tabs, the content in the second and third tabs don&rsquo;t update until you select something new, which can lead to confusing or irrelevant information being displayed in them. On the iPad, GameTrack would probably benefit from considering the new sidebar layout offered with iPadOS 14, which is something developer Joe Kimberlin-Wyer has said <a href="https://twitter.com/joekw/status/1281308221806981121?s=21" rel="noopener noreferrer">he is working on</a>.</p>
<hr id="hr19"><p id="p20">Despite a somewhat awkward iPad design and some wishes here and there, I love GameTrack. Now, when someone recommends a game, I quickly drop it into my Wish List for the next time I&rsquo;m in the mood for a new game and have the time to play it. That&rsquo;s a much better system than buying a game on a whim and letting it sit for months before I try it for the first time.</p>
<p id="p21">I&rsquo;ve also found myself browsing the Discover tab a lot, too, especially when I get behind on the videogame news that I usually follow. It&rsquo;s a quick way to get a fix of the latest popular games and watch a few trailers, which open in Safari View Controller so I don&rsquo;t have to leave the app.</p>
<p id="p22">Videogames have been one of my outlets as I&rsquo;ve spent more time at home during the global pandemic. They&rsquo;ve served an important entertainment role, allowing me to escape from the constant barrage of bad news for a little while. GameTrack has reduced the friction of starting a new game, even if I&rsquo;ve been away from gaming for a while, by always having something ready on one of my lists, which I love. If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to organize your gaming life, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with GameTrack.</p>
<p id="p23">GameTrack <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available on the App Store</a> as a free download. Custom icons and lists, ranked lists, tints, themes, layouts, and automatically updating release dates for games are all part of a $0.99/month or $7.99/year subscription.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Pursuant to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/microsoft-ends-cloud-streaming-beta-for-ios-preps-android-only-launch/">the announcement earlier this week that Microsoft would not be bringing its xCloud game streaming service to iOS</a>, the two companies have exchanged fire over where the blame lies. First, Apple lashed out, providing a statement to several outlets, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations">including The Verge</a>, confirming that xCloud violates the App Store guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.</p>
<p>  Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack there, but let’s just start by noting that the requirement to vet all individual games is, let me be frank, a load of hooey. Apple doesn’t review all the titles available on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or any of the myriad of streaming services that have apps on the App Store. Nor does it check every book title available on the Kindle, Nook, or Kobo apps. But we’ll get back to that in a moment.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn’t take long to shoot back, issuing its own statement to several publications, including Gizmodo:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Our testing period for the Project xCloud preview app for iOS has expired. Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store. Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content. All games available in the Xbox Game Pass catalog are rated for content by independent industry ratings bodies such as the ESRB and regional equivalents. We are committed to finding a path to bring cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to the iOS platform. We believe that the customer should be at the heart of the gaming experience and gamers tell us they want to play, connect and share anywhere, no matter where they are. We agree.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Microsoft has a number of good points here. First, that all of its games are already reviewed and issued content ratings by the ESRB, an industry organization that’s essentially the MPAA for games. Second, that Apple does seem to treat gaming apps differently from other streaming apps, as I noted above.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time recently that Microsoft—and I get it, it’s rich, <em>Microsoft</em>—has attacked Apple because of anticompetitive behavior. Ahead of the antitrust hearings in Washington last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-us-congress-apple-app-store-fees-104527483.html">Microsoft had already expressed concern about Apple’s position with the App Store</a>. It’s entirely possible Microsoft knew this particular fight was brewing, but it also seems as though Redmond had already run afoul of App Store restrictions with other products, like Office.</p>
<p>All of this boils down to things not looking great for Apple and the App Store. Cupertino has doubled down on its defenses, with Tim Cook insisting that it treats everybody the same, but the best you can say for that is that it’s an Obi-Wan Kenobi-style equivocation about it being true from a certain point of view.</p>
<p>As Apple has become the most valuable company in the world, it’s increasingly clear that its biggest threat is itself. Throw out whatever cliché axiom you prefer—power corrupts, or the road to hell being paved with good intentions—but Apple certainly seems to increasingly have become one of those entities that will go to any lengths to protect its people, even if that means verging into the authoritarian.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I no sooner hit publish on this piece than I saw <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/07/facebook-criticizes-apples-app-store-policies/">this story</a> about Apple forcing the Facebook Gaming app to launch with no games in it, due to App Store rules. Certainly provides more ammunition for Microsoft’s argument that Apple treats games differently. Moreover, this seems to look even more transparently bad from a competitive standpoint, as Apple Arcade clearly benefits from these moves.</em></p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-microsoft-spar-over-cloud-gaming-against-antitrust-backdrop/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been just over a month since President Trump signed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, so guess what he did today? He turned right around and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-reimpose-aluminum-tariffs-on-canada-11596747137">placed new tariffs on Canadian aluminum:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House said <strong>certain types of aluminum were surging into the U.S.,</strong> depressing the U.S. industry. The administration justified the tariffs, which will be set at 10%, using a national security provision and argued that a depressed U.S. aluminum industry threatens U.S. national security.</p>
<p>“Earlier today I signed a proclamation that defends American industry by reimposing aluminum tariffs on Canada,” President Trump said during a speech at a Whirlpool factory in Clyde, Ohio. <strong>“Canada was taking advantage of us, as usual,”</strong> he said. “The aluminum business was being decimated by Canada, very unfair to our jobs and our great aluminum workers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about &#8220;certain types&#8221; of aluminum, but it&#8217;s pretty easy to dig up <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/country/sitc/index.html">total US imports of aluminum from Canada:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857586"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857586" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_canada_aluminum_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="619"></figure>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but it doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like there&#8217;s been a surge in aluminum imports from Canada. Maybe there is if you do it by tonnes instead of dollars? Or if you look only at certain specialized types of aluminum products? Or something.</p>
<p>More likely, Trump still hasn&#8217;t gotten over being humiliated by Justin Trudeau at that G7 meeting a few years ago. That&#8217;s more his style.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>A few years ago I wrote a post about new research into the cause of Japanese surrender in World War II. Today is the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, and I thought it might be interesting to repost it. Here it is.</p>
<hr width="30%">
<p>There has long been a scholarly debate about whether it was necessary for the United States to use atomic weapons to bring World War II to an end. Traditionalists say yes: If not for Fat Man and Little Boy, Japan would have fought to the last man. But revisionists argue that by August of 1945: (a) Japan&#8217;s situation was catastrophically hopeless; (b) they knew it and were ready to surrender; and (c) thanks to decoded Japanese diplomatic messages, Harry Truman and other American leaders knew they were ready. A Japanese surrender could have been negotiated in fairly short order with or without the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>For various reasons I&#8217;ve always found the revisionist view unsatisfactory. After all, even <em>after</em> the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, we know there was still considerable debate within the Japanese war cabinet over their next step. Surely if Japan had already been close to unconditional surrender in early August—and for better or worse, unconditional surrender was an American requirement—the atomic demonstration of August 6 would have been more than enough to tip them over the edge. But it didn&#8217;t. It was only after the second bomb was dropped that Japan ultimately agreed to surrender.</p>
<p>But although the revisionist view has never persuaded me, a new revisionist view has been swirling around the academic community for several years—and this one seems much more interesting. Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, a trilingual English/Russian/Japanese historian, reminds us that the actual timeline of Japanese surrender went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>August 6:</strong> Hiroshima bomb dropped.</p>
<p><strong>August 8:</strong> Soviet Union declares war on Japan and invades Manchuria.</p>
<p><strong>August 9:</strong> Nagasaki bomb dropped.</p>
<p><strong>August 10:</strong> Emperor Hirohito breaks the cabinet deadlock and decides that Japan must surrender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="image image-_original" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 8px 20px 15px 30px;" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/images/blog_hiroshima_atomic_bomb.jpg" alt="" align="right"></p>
<p>So what really caused the Japanese to finally give up? Was it America&#8217;s atomic bombs, or was it the Soviet Union&#8217;s entrance into the Pacific war? Hasegawa, based on meticulous research into primary sources, argues that it was probably the latter—though not quite in the way we usually think. <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/08/07/why_did_japan_surrender/?page=full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gareth Cook summarizes Hasegawa&#8217;s argument in the <em>Boston Globe</em>:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to his close examination of the evidence, Japan was not poised to surrender before Hiroshima, as the revisionists argued, nor was it ready to give in immediately after the atomic bomb, as traditionalists have always seen it.…Americans, then and today, have tended to assume that Japan&#8217;s leaders were simply blinded by their own fanaticism, forcing a catastrophic showdown for no reason other than their refusal to acknowledge defeat.…But Hasegawa and other historians have shown that Japan&#8217;s leaders were in fact quite savvy, well aware of their difficult position, and holding out for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>Their concern was not so much whether to end the conflict, but how to end it while holding onto territory, avoiding war crimes trials, and preserving the imperial system. The Japanese could still inflict heavy casualties on any invader, <strong>and they hoped to convince the Soviet Union, still neutral in the Asian theater, to mediate a settlement with the Americans.</strong> Stalin, they calculated, might negotiate more favorable terms in exchange for territory in Asia. It was a long shot, but it made strategic sense.</p>
<p>On Aug. 6, the American bomber Enola Gay dropped its payload on Hiroshima.…As Hasegawa writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Racing-Enemy-Stalin-Truman-Surrender/dp/0674022416/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313639560&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Racing the Enemy,&#8221;</a> the Japanese leadership reacted with concern, but not panic.…Very late the next night, however, something happened that did change the plan. The Soviet Union declared war and launched a broad surprise attack on Japanese forces in Manchuria. In that instant, Japan&#8217;s strategy was ruined. <strong>Stalin would not be extracting concessions from the Americans.</strong> And the approaching Red Army brought new concerns: The military position was more dire, and it was hard to imagine occupying communists allowing Japan&#8217;s traditional imperial system to continue. Better to surrender to Washington than to Moscow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some sense, the real answer here is probably unknowable. Two events happened at nearly the same time, and they were closely followed by a third. Figuring out conclusively what caused what may simply not be possible. Probably they both played a role. Still, aside from the documentary evidence that Hasegawa amasses, his theory accounts for other aspects of the war. Like the dog that didn&#8217;t bark in the night, Japan didn&#8217;t give up after the fire bombing of Tokyo. Nor did Germany surrender after the fire bombing of Dresden. And although it&#8217;s undeniably true that atomic bombs are a more dramatic way of destroying a city than conventional weaponry, it&#8217;s also undeniably true that simply destroying a city was never enough to produce a surrender. So why would destroying a city with an atomic bomb be that much different?</p>
<p>This is fascinating stuff. At the same time, I think that Cook takes a step too far when he suggests that Hasegawa&#8217;s research, if true, should fundamentally change our view of atomic weapons. &#8220;If the atomic bomb alone could not compel the Japanese to submit,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;then perhaps the nuclear deterrent is not as strong as it seems.&#8221; But that hardly follows. America in 1945 had an air force capable of leveling cities with conventional weaponry. We still do—though barely—but no other country in the world comes close. With an atomic bomb and a delivery vehicle, North Korea can threaten to destroy Seoul. Without it, they can&#8217;t. And larger atomic states, like the US, India, Pakistan, and Russia, have the capacity to do more than just level a city or two. They can level entire countries.</p>
<p>So, no: Hasegawa&#8217;s research is fascinating for what it tells us about a key event in history. But should it change our view of atomic weaponry or atomic deterrence? I doubt it. It&#8217;s not 1945 anymore.</p>
