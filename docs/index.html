    <p>Some of you may be wondering why President Trump seems to have it in for the Postal Service. It&#8217;s a short story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump hates the <em>Washington Post</em>, which is owned by Jeff Bezos.</li>
<li>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673881733415178240">tweeted</a> about this once and Bezos responded with a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297">joke</a>. Trump can&#8217;t stand jokes at his expense, so he hates Bezos.</li>
<li>Bezos is CEO of Amazon, therefore Trump hates Amazon.</li>
<li>The Postal Service delivers some of Amazon&#8217;s packages. As a matter of revenge, Trump wants them to raise the rates they charge Amazon.</li>
<li>They have refused to do so, therefore Trump hates the Postal Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe it or not, that&#8217;s all there is to it. Trump has been waiting five years for an opportunity to take revenge on the Postal Service, and the current ruckus over vote-by-mail has given him his chance. He&#8217;s pretending that it&#8217;s all about ballot fraud and inefficient management and so forth, but it&#8217;s really about the fact that Bezos—who is considerably richer than Trump—once made a modest joke about Trump and the Postal Service got caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that&#8217;s how the United States of America is governed these days.</p>

<p>Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.pdf?ts=1597165378">last week&#8217;s decision</a> by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing the District Court&#8217;s ruling that Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust violations, opened her opinion thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This case asks us to draw the line between anticompetitive behavior, which is illegal under federal antitrust law, and hypercompetitive behavior, which is not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, admittedly, a distinction I have not seen before, but it is perhaps a useful one, for the simple reason that being a successful business by definition means being anticompetitive: without some sort of differentiation and/or superior cost structure any sort of margin a business has will be competed away, and so preserving that differentiation and/or cost structure — being anticompetitive — should be the goal of any business. The distinction Callahan was drawing, though, is necessary if you interpret &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; as being &#8220;illegal&#8221;: businesses should compete, but they should not break the law along the way.</p>
<p>What makes this distinction particularly challenging is that the question as to what is anticompetitive and what is simply good business changes as a business scales. A small business can generally be as anticompetitive as it wants to be, while a much larger business is much more constrained in how anticompetitively it can act (as a quick aside, for the first part of this essay I am painting in broad strokes as far as questions of specific legality go). The specific case of Apple and the iPhone raises an additional angle: should the importance of the market in the question make a difference as well?</p>
<h4>Apple&#8217;s Vertical Integration</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s business model, which <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">uses software to differentiate hardware</a>, is designed to be anticompetitive. The company has traditionally made its money by selling physical devices which run Apple&#8217;s proprietary operating systems; its device-manufacturing competitors, meanwhile, have had to rely on an operating system that they could license, primarily Windows for PCs, and Android for mobile devices. They cannot license macOS or iOS.</p>
<p>What is funny about calling this strategy &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; is that it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that most pundits were sure Apple was anti-competing themselves into the ground. When Stratechery started in 2013, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-being-greedy-2013-9">media was filled</a> with predictions of the iPhone&#8217;s imminent demise at the hands of Android: there were simply too many other manufacturers making too many smartphones at too many price points that Apple could not or would not match, which would inevitably lead to developers fleeing iOS and Apple fighting for its life.</p>
<p>The problem with these predictions, as I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</a>, is that they drastically undervalued the experience of using Apple&#8217;s integrated products.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The business buyer, famously, does not care about the user experience. They are not the user, and so items that change how a product feels or that eliminate small annoyances simply don’t make it into their rational decision making process. Again, though, Christensen’s research is tilted towards business buyers. Critically, this includes the PC. For the most of its history, the vast majority of PC purchasers have been businesses, who have bought PCs on speeds, feeds, and ultimately, price…
</p></blockquote>
<p>I attributed Apple&#8217;s ability to eliminate many of those small annoyances to its vertical integration, which had long been out of fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The traditional business theory about vertical integration rests on the costs and controls…The issue I have with this analysis of vertical integration…is that the only considered costs are financial. But there are other, more difficult to quantify costs. Modularization incurs costs in the design and experience of using products that cannot be overcome, yet cannot be measured. Business buyers — and the analysts who study them — simply ignore them, but consumers don’t. Some consumers inherently know and value quality, look-and-feel, and attention to detail, and are willing to pay a premium that far exceeds the financial costs of being vertically integrated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing that is worth noting is that Apple has only ever integrated part of its value chain, particularly once it started manufacturing in China. A Mac, for example, looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png" alt="Apple&#039;s integration of software and hardware" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5226" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In this view Apple integrates hardware made with industry-standard components and macOS, providing a platform for even more app developers. Of course, this view of the Mac will soon be obsolete: Apple computers will soon come with Apple&#8217;s own chips, which is to say that the company is backward-integrating into one of its most important components. This is, as far as I can tell, seen as a good thing: Apple has both demonstrated its ability to build fast chips and to integrate those chips with its operating system; no one feels especially bad for Intel, particularly since the company had its own near-monopoly for decades.</p>
<h4>App Store Integration</h4>
<p>Of course iPhones have already been using Apple&#8217;s own chips for a decade; what has always made the iPhone different than the Mac, though, is the degree to which Apple has forward-integrated into the app ecosystem. What is critical to understand is that this integration proceeded in parts, and that those parts build on each other.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part One: Installation</strong></p>
<p>Start with app installation: because Apple controls the operating system, it controls what apps can or cannot be installed on the device. iOS will only run apps have permission from Apple (this permission is ultimately enforced by Apple&#8217;s hardware), and Apple grants this permission via the App Store. To put it in the context of the value chain, Apple leverages its integration of hardware and software to control app installation:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png" alt="iOS integrated app installation" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5224" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-300x266.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-768x680.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It is essential to note that this forward integration has had huge benefits for everyone involved. While Apple pretends like <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1288297750690328576">the Internet never existed as a distribution channel</a>, the truth is it was a channel that wasn&#8217;t great for a lot of users: people were scared to install apps, convinced they would mess up their computers, get ripped off, or accidentally install a virus.</p>
<p>The App Store changed all of that: Apple effectively extended the trust it had earned with users over the years to all developers in the App Store. Users could install whatever they wanted, confident the app would not mess up their phone, rip them off, or be a virus. This by extension meant that the addressable market was far larger for app developers than the PC was, even though it would be several years before smartphones had a larger installed base than PCs. And this, of course, brought benefits to Apple:</p>

<p>This was the combination of integration and modularity at its absolute best: Apple leveraged its control to create a better market that benefited everyone.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Two: Payment Processing</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Apple controlled app installation, it was a natural extension into payment processing, particularly since the App Store was built on the same infrastructure as iTunes.</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png" alt="App installation integrated payment processing" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5223" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, like iTunes at the time, payment processing functionality was limited to up-front purchases. Suppose you wanted Super Monkey Ball: you had to pay $9.99 to even download the app; there were no trials or in-app purchases:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/10-years-of-app-store-a-timeline-of-changes/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png" alt="The original App Store" width="436" height="653" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5222" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png 684w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-200x300.png 200w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-768x1150.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-421x630.png 421w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996.png 873w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>From the beginning Apple kept 30% of every purchase; that was similar to the rate <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117340340327331757">the company kept for iTunes purchases</a>, and perhaps more pertinently, just barely covered credit card processing fees for a $0.99 app.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_0_5217" id="identifier_0_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Credit card processing fees generally consist of a fixed fee between $0.25 and $0.30 per transaction, plus 1.5%~3.0%; Apple of course would have had a significant volume discount.">1</a></p>
<p>This gets at why this was another great deal for everyone involved: most users had already trusted Apple with their credit card information, and again, Apple was extending that trust to every developer in its App Store, making it far more likely that developers would earn money on their apps than if they had to drive downloads and purchases on their own. And once again, this circled back to Apple&#8217;s benefit, both in terms of the ecosystem broadly and, as the App Store reached scale (and added in-app purchasing), real profits.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Three: Customer Management</strong></p>
<p>That Apple has controlled app installation and payment processing from the beginning is an obvious point; what is less appreciated is that Apple leveraged its control of payment processing, which was based on its control of app installation, which was based on its control of the operating system, into complete ownership of the customer relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png" alt="Payment processing integrated the customer relationship" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5225" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Users didn&#8217;t pay developers, they paid Apple, who paid developers. Users didn&#8217;t get receipts from developers, they got receipts from Apple, who kept their email address for themselves. This did have some user benefits, particularly in terms of ensuring their data was not sold to unscrupulous data brokers, but the benefit to developers was much less clear cut. There remains no means to offer refunds, for example, and for many years developers could not respond to negative reviews in the App Store.</p>
<p>What was most frustrating for developers, though, was that the lack of a customer relationship, in conjunction with the lack of functionality for upgrade pricing, made it difficult to build sustainable businesses in product spaces that did not have an obvious service component (which might require a subscription) or consumables (which could be bought with in-app purchases). The App Store was about transactions, not relationships, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">Apple liked it that way</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>These three distinct integrations, each of which built on the previous, were present in the App Store from Day One — and Steve Jobs knew it. He articulated what just took me 700 words in a crisp five minutes and seven seconds:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_1_5217" id="identifier_1_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Although I can&rsquo;t help but note that 2:30 mark has a very rare Apple presentation error: the Backgammon game should be on the iPhone screen">2</a></p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-s6wdT7tS-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-s6wdT7tS-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store</p></video></div></div>
<p>Everything about this video was exceptional at the time, and just as critically, nothing was objectionable. After all, the iPhone was still a small business; from a developer perspective, the App Store was (almost) all upside. It would be users who would vote with their wallets in favor of Apple&#8217;s approach.</p>
<h4>App Store Problems</h4>
<p>There is a bit of a running joke in tech that the mainstream media believes that every tech company is ridiculously over-valued right up until the day that the exact same company is a juggernaut that is killing industries; in the case of Apple, the company&#8217;s strategy was doomed right up until it was illegal, or so it seems with the App Store.</p>
<p>In truth, though, while many of the issues surrounding the App Store are about Apple being a whole lot bigger than they were in 2008, the company has, particularly over the last few years, extended its control further and further away from the core integration that undergirds its business.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the company required that apps that utilize third-party login services also utilize &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; (which had to be at the top of the list). This, by extension, meant that cross-platform apps and services had to integrate &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; into their Android and web apps. This was in part a further assumption of customer management, and also an extension of control beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s control of the customer relationship has also helped sustain its control of payment processing; after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller">Amazon advertised that Kindle books were available on all platforms</a> Apple forced the bookseller to stop selling books in its app. Moreover, Amazon couldn&#8217;t even <em>tell</em> users to visit Amazon.com, much less offer a link or, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apple-app-store-follow-up-aws-arm-servers-intels-impending-choice/">as Android allows</a>, a webview of the store.</p>
<p>What is troubling about this example, which also applies to Netflix, Spotify, and other so-called &#8220;Reader&#8221; apps, is that Apple&#8217;s aggressive integration up the stack isn&#8217;t really helping anyone. Users are confused, these big developers get fewer customers than they might have otherwise, while Apple&#8217;s overall iPhone experience is degraded. The ones that really lose out, though, are smaller developers whose cost structures cannot support Apple&#8217;s 30% cut, yet don&#8217;t have the brand awareness to enable customers to find their websites. In this way Apple is actually making dominant companies even stronger (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/">much like they are Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Apple also appears to be making an effort to limit this exception; while Basecamp managed to drive Apple to a face-saving retreat from its insistence on in-app purchase for its Hey email service, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/">I heard from many developers</a> that App Store review had started rejecting apps that had been in the store for years because they only allowed users to subscribe on the web.</p>
<p>What was particularly disappointing about these shakedowns, though, is that Apple itself admitted <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-reveals-new-developer-technologies-to-foster-the-next-generation-of-apps/">in a press release</a> that it had been holding up bug fixes in App Review &#8220;over guideline violations&#8221;, many of which were about driving usage of its own payment processor. This is truly an inversion of the win-win-win dynamic that characterized the company&#8217;s previous integration efforts: now users were being put at risk for bugs developers were liable for because of arbitrary reasons related to Apple&#8217;s drive for Services revenue.</p>
<p>Of course Apple had long put users at risk in other ways; the company had turned a blind eye to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/dependent-digital-whales/">the search for digital whales</a> who would spend huge amounts of money on games they could never win. This was, in retrospect, the canary in the coal mine about the corrupting power of the App Store: Apple had started out bragging how they would protect users, but the company seemed far more concerned about protecting its bottom line.</p>
<p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple&#8217;s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn&#8217;t support traditional trials<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_2_5217" id="identifier_2_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You can trial a subscription only">3</a> or upgrades, the importance of which I&#8217;ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>For me this is the biggest disappointment. I have long believed that the Internet is going to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">fundamentally remake all aspects of society</a>, including the economy, and that one area of immense promise is small-scale entrepreneurship. The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p>
<p>All that noted, what does remain valuable is Apple&#8217;s total control of the installation process. The iPhone is probably the most valuable target on earth for scams and hackers, and while <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/">vulnerabilities have been exploited</a>, there is no denying the fact that users are safer on iOS than they are on other platforms, and that is valuable to everyone involved.</p>
<h4>The Epic Lawsuit</h4>
<p>All of this explains why I find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">Epic&#8217;s lawsuit against Apple</a>, which was filed last Thursday after the company updated Fortnite to include an alternate payment system, and was promptly kicked out of the store by Apple, such a bummer.</p>
<p>Epic is attacking every level of the iPhone stack: the company doesn&#8217;t just want a direct relationship with customers, and it doesn&#8217;t just want to use its own payment processor; it is also demanding the right to run its own App Store. There is precedence on the PC: there Epic has built a rival to Steam that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">has benefited gamers most of all</a>; at the same time, the PC has always been completely open, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>My preferred outcome would see Apple maintaining its control of app installation. I treasure and depend on the openness of PCs and Macs, but I am also relieved that the iPhone is so dependable for those less technically savvy than me. What would be a far better outcome, at least from my perspective, would be Apple remembering that those same users that benefit from the iPhone being locked down should be the focus everywhere.</p>
<p>That means, for example, allowing purchases via webviews, particularly for products and experiences that are not zero marginal costs. Sure, that could mean less App Store revenue in the short run, but Apple would be well-served having to build more and better products to win developers over. At the end of the day, squeezing businesses that can stomach the cost of Apple development, both in terms of implementing in-app purchase and that 30%, by definition has less ultimate upside than growing the pie for everyone.</p>
<p>This lawsuit is also a reminder that Apple has a lot to lose. While the most likely outcome is an Apple victory — the Supreme Court has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-response-to-hey-heys-response-to-apple-heys-limited-antitrust-options/">pretty consistent</a> in holding that companies do not have a &#8220;duty to deal&#8221; — every decision the company makes that favors only itself, and not society generally, is an invitation to examine just how important the iPhone is to, well, everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the most frustrating aspect of this debate: Apple consistently acts like a company peeved it is not getting its fair share, somehow ignoring the fact it is worth nearly $2 trillion precisely because the iPhone matters more than anything. This is not a console you play to entertain yourself, or even a PC for work: it is the foundation of modern life, which makes it all the more disappointing that Apple seems to care more about its short term bottom line than it does about the users and developers that used to share in its integration upside; if Apple doesn&#8217;t change course, hyperessential will at some point trump hypercompetitive.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/apple-tv-plus-subscribers-get-cbs-all-access-and-showtime-bundle-at-a-great-value/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the first bundle offer</a> that&rsquo;s ever been available for channels in the company&rsquo;s TV app. It comes with a unique twist in that the offer is only available for customers who already subscribe to Apple TV+, whether through a paid subscription or as part of their free year of service for purchasing a new Apple product. Apple TV+ subscribers can now subscribe to a bundle of CBS All Access and SHOWTIME for just $9.99 per month following a 7-day free trial. When subscribed to separately, these two channels together would cost $20.98 per month, making this a substantial offer.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple&rsquo;s press release highlights some of the features that make channel subscriptions appealing:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  By subscribing through Apple TV channels, customers can watch content from all three services online and offline, ad-free and on demand, only on the Apple TV app. Through Family Sharing, up to six family members can share the subscriptions to Apple TV+, CBS All Access, and SHOWTIME using just their personal Apple ID and password.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">As someone who has used Apple&rsquo;s TV app heavily for years, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-tv-channels-a-great-tv-experience-thats-failing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">written before</a> about how much value I find in the channels experience, and how disappointed I am that Apple hasn&rsquo;t been able to strike more deals for additional channels partners. When Apple TV channels first launched in early 2019, HBO was the most prestigious channel available, but when that service transitioned to become HBO Max, there was no longer a channel option available for Apple users. New streaming services like Disney+ and Peacock haven&rsquo;t been made available as channels either. So Apple has built a solid TV experience for the streaming age, but it&rsquo;s not available for the services people care about most. I&rsquo;m not particularly hopeful that today&rsquo;s bundle news will change that at all, but it&rsquo;s good to at least see a little life from the company&rsquo;s channels initiative.</p>

    <p>It’s 2020, and Apple is shipping a <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1219299028791226368">rack-mountable Mac Pro</a>. It’s the latest chapter in a decades-long flirtation between Apple and the machines that dwell in the server closet. Even though the Mac Pro is rack-mountable, Apple can’t quite see it as a server—<a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1217136324219568128">you can’t buy it without a mouse and keyboard</a>. Instead, the company seems content to let individual users and dedicated third parties like MacStadium do the work of taking Mac workstations and treating them like they belong in a server rack.</p>
<p>This is a subject that’s close to my heart. I’ve only had my name on a single printed book and it was called “<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/providing-internet-services-via-the-mac-os/oclc/34243972">Providing Internet Services via the Mac OS</a>,” and told you everything you needed to know to turn a Mac running Classic Mac OS into a server. (Yes, that was a thing that we did back then.) From the mid-90s through the early 2000s, I had a series of Macs running classic Mac OS in my closet that acted as web, email, FTP, and database servers. Here’s to the crazy ones, I guess.</p>
<p>Apple has always been a consumer hardware company through and through, not a company that makes servers or speaks to an audience of IT people and network managers. But that hasn’t stopped it from trying. In the ’90s, Apple would rebadge Power Macs as Apple Workgroup Servers, bundling them with extra hardware and software.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Shiner. (Not a Mac.)</figcaption></figure><p>I started covering Apple in the mid-90s, and let me tell you, that particular version of Apple was extremely weird, as epitomized by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsVAdrdkyoA">Apple Network Server</a>, code-named Shiner.</p>
<p>Shiner was not a Mac. Shiner was a PowerPC-based server that cost between $11,000 and $15,000, and ran IBM’s version of UNIX known as AIX—which you needed to buy separately, for an additional $1,600. It was delayed several times, as its competitive advantage over PCs running Novell NetWare continued to dissipate. Robert Hess of MacWEEK wrote in 1995 that Apple had “missed its window of opportunity.” Reviews were positive, but tempered with a skepticism (later proven right) that Apple would actually commit to making a line of Unix-based servers.</p>
<p>Like most mid-90s Apple products, Shiner was killed off in 1997 as Apple was gripped by  its near-death experience. “I look at [Apple Network Servers] as a dream when Apple was in the coma,” Steve Jobs later said, while insisting that what would come next would be entirely different.</p>
<p>In fact,  the arrival of Jobs actually planted the seed of Apple’s next attempt to fit in a server rack: NextStep, the operating system that would evolve into Mac OS X, was based on Unix. The door was open for a Mac to be a real live Unix-based server and it took Apple almost no time to build its own server hardware.</p>
<p>It was OS X. On a server. It was Xserve. Pronounced like the letter, not the roman numeral. No, I don’t know why. Apple did stuff like that back in 2002.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06-xserve_front.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Steve Jobs and Jony Ive era of Apple was a design heyday when Apple created many interesting, clever, and influential products. The Xserve was… not that. It was most definitely the sign of a design team trying to figure out how to add some flair and creativity to a place—the server rack—that did not care one bit about either of those.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08-xserve_rack.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve was designed to live in the server rack.</figcaption></figure><p>Sized specifically for server racks, it was what’s called a 1U server, meaning it was a single unit high—so 1.75 inches thick, to go with the dimensions of a 19-inch equipment rack. Those dimensions are unusually large for a Mac: 18 inches wide and 28 inches deep. This was not a pizza box. This was an extra-extra-large, party-size pizza box.</p>
<p>Apple has frequently struggled between its instinct to create beautiful designs and designs that make its products more functional. Some of Apple’s worst design missteps have come because looks were prioritized over usability. (Feel free to think of your favorite example now. I’m imagining a round Mac Pro and an ultra-thin keyboard with no key travel.)</p>
<p>Xserve, then, was a real design challenge. How do you take pride in creating something for a server rack, the most utilitarian of environments? I’m not here to tell you Xserve was pretty, because it wasn’t. But it’s clear Apple’s designers struggled mightily to give it a little extra something.</p>
<p>The pretty stuff was on the front—fitting, since that’s really the only part you could see. There were shiny buttons, a FireWire 400 port, a slimline CD-ROM drive, and four hot-swappable hard drive modules. Press the front of a module and once the drive dismounted, a light appeared, indicating it was safe to remove the disk.</p>
<p>The back side featured a standard array of ports for the time, room for ports from three expansion cards, and the notably weird PC-standard DB-9 serial port. The idea was that you could connect to the Xserve and gain command-line access via serial, even if it wasn’t on your network. It’s a choice that makes sense for a server, but it’s pretty wacky for a Mac.</p>
<p>There was so much room inside that Xserve case that Apple designed it with two fans. The idea was that if one fan became less capable, the other fan would adjust to compensate—and if you needed to swap a fan out, you could do so without shutting the computer down.</p>
<p>Those fans are another of the Xserve’s unusual qualities: This is undoubtedly, indisputably the loudest Mac ever made. If people thought they could tuck these in a server rack in their quiet studio space, they were wrong… those fans <em>howled</em>. This was a server designed to be put away in a closet or server installation.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-xserveraid_3q.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve RAID.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xserve also inspired the creation of one of Apple’s most unusual Mac accessories this side of the Duo Dock: The Xserve RAID. This was a 3U high 14-disk hard drive array with a design to match the Xserve.</p>
<p>The early 2000s were an era when Apple was so excited by the prospect of Mac OS X’s Unix underpinnings that it designed a rack-mountable Mac server and a 14-disk RAID system. “We have a lot to learn, but I think we’re going to learn fast, and learn by working with some great customers,” Jobs said on the day of the Xserve’s unveiling. But by the end of the decade it was clear that this was an area best served by other companies—not Apple.</p>
<p>Over the decades, Apple’s instinct for identifying the core of its business has been good, but there have been exceptions at the fringes. It created Aperture thinking it would take on Adobe for the high-end photography market… and then thought better of it.</p>
<p>Xserve is a similar example. The company saw a niche market where it could make something cooler and better and more cutting edge. But every other strategic decision Apple made during that era was in the service of its core business of making personal computers. Xserve survived eight years, including the transition to Intel, but it could not have been a hard decision for Apple to discontinue it and steer people who needed Mac servers to the Mac Pro and Mac mini.</p>
<p>Mac servers never died. They’re still all over the place, operated by people who are more comfortable with macOS than the alternatives. I’ve had a Mac mini running as a server in my house since the first one arrived on the scene. And yes, that rack-mountable Mac Pro is now available.</p>
<p>But the Xserve will always stand alone. It was the only Mac made specifically for that equipment rack. I’d ask for us to take a moment of silence to remember it, but you wouldn’t be able to hear yourself think over the fan noise.</p>

    <p>In my COVID-19 chart roundup this morning you may have noticed a tiny uptick in Italy&#8217;s mortality numbers. I thought about mentioning it, but decided to wait a few days to see if it was just a blip. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-shutters-nightclubs-mandates-masks-as-coronavirus-case-numbers-rise-again/2020/08/17/24e5e2e4-e066-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_virusitaly-1045a%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">Apparently it&#8217;s not:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With daily coronavirus case numbers rising,</strong> Italy on Monday imposed its first new restrictions on daily life since coming out of lockdown nearly four months ago, ordering the closure of nightclubs and mandating mask-wearing, even outdoors, in areas with nightlife&#8230;.Although the Italian restrictions are modest, they amount to a test of whether a country can keep the virus at bay without resorting to the blunt-force lockdown strategy used earlier in the pandemic. Italy’s government is specifically targeting nightclubs and evening socializing as cases are increasingly detected among the young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, case counts have been rising for the past several weeks:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859580"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859580" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_italy_cases_august_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="616"></figure>
<p>The number of new daily cases has nearly tripled since early July. This is an early test of whether countries can <em>ever</em> come out of lockdown and remain safe until we have an effective vaccine. It&#8217;s not looking good so far.</p>

    <p>Though it might still only be mid-August, fall is rapidly approaching. That’s not only significant because it will hopefully mean the end of the heat that’s been barraging my home for the last several weeks, but also because it’s traditionally Apple’s busiest time of the year.</p>
<p>I say “traditionally” because this year, well, everything’s a little bit off-kilter. Still, it does seem as though the Cupertino-based company is getting its ducks in a row for its usual deluge of product releases, even if the actual event might look more like this year’s WWDC keynote than fall Apple events of years past.</p>
<p>So, in advance of everything kicking off, let’s take a moment to go over what might be the most exciting announcements to come out of Apple Park in the next few months, and what we all might have to look forward to. (Because, in this day and age, we all need <em>something</em> to look forward to, don’t we?)</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3571456/whats-in-store-and-in-stores-for-apple-this-fall.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

I didn’t ask the clerk at Barnes &amp; Noble what channel she watched the speech on her new TV. It was none of my business, like a bunch of other things that were none of my business when she sold me my copy of<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Harris’ memoir.</a> The important thing to her was that she had a new TV.</span></h5>
<p>The clerk who rang up my copy of Kamala Harris’ memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Truths We Hold”</a>, was a short, thin, white woman about my age, with wire framed glasses, dark graying hair haphazardly pinned back from her heart shaped face, her eyes smiling brightly over her surgical blue cloth mask. Her eyes got brighter as she slid the book under the plexiglass. “Did you see her speech?”</p>
<p>Her tone suggested she had and it had made her an enthusiastic Harris fan, if she wasn’t one already. It also suggested I must be one too. Why else would I be buying the book?</p>
<p>“I saw part of it. I came in late,” I said regretfully. I didn’t get into the problems I’d had getting it to stream on my computer. “I heard the best part was the beginning when she talked about her friendship with Beau.”</p>
<p>She assured me it was a nice tribute. I told her I hadn’t known they were friends. If I had I would have believed she was a lock for the nomination. “I don’t much about him,” she said apologetically. I resisted the temptation to mansplain the man. I said, &quot;I think there&#39;s a section in the book dealing with him and their friendship,&quot; and left it at that. She said she looked forward to reading it. I asked for her impression of the whole speech but it turned out there was something she was more excited about than the speech itself---that <em>she had been able to watch it.</em> “I just got a TV!” she practically burbled. “It’s my first.”</p>
<p>This threw me a bit. A fellow boomer and it’s her first TV? I went quickly through the possibilities. She meant it was the first TV that was all her own? All her previous TVs she’d shared with her family, roommates, partner or spouse? That raised questions about her living arrangements and what became of the “owner” of the old TV, questions that were none of my business. Or was she one of those people who had not wanted a TV or hadn’t been able to afford one when she’d set out on her own and found she got along fine without one? So then, why had she decided to get one now? Had she inherited it? From whom and under what circumstances? Again, not my business. So I said, “Just in time for the convention.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait!” she said.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope it’s all good news from here on out.”</p>
<p>“If it’s not,” she said, still cheerful but with a note of steely determination, “it’s going right back!”</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-16/postal-service-cutbacks-spur-fear-of-election-havoc">Now we&#8217;re talking:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spurred by fears that President Trump is trying to eviscerate the U.S. Postal Service to help him win reelection, <strong>Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday abruptly summoned the House back to Washington this week</strong> to pass a bill aimed at rolling back administration cutbacks that could cripple widespread mail-in voting. Congressional Democrats also called on the recently appointed postmaster general to testify Aug. 24 at an emergency hearing by a House committee about cost-cutting moves that led to steep slowdowns in mail service in much of the country over the last three months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an area where good politics and good policy come together. The Postal Service really does need higher funding, especially this year, and this is a very popular position since practically everyone loves the post office. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Republicans being willing to take a beating over this for months on end, especially since it&#8217;s unlikely to actually make a big difference in the election results anyway. Donald Trump is too stupid to know this, but most Republican leaders know it perfectly well.</p>

    <p>I woke up at 6 today. 6 pm, that is. These crash days are really getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Anyway, this means I missed an entire day, so let&#8217;s see what happened here in Orange County while I was snoozing. It&#8217;s Sunday, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8633503/Wild-pack-Karens-accuse-grocery-store-committing-WAR-CRIMES-denying-entry.html">so there can&#8217;t be much going—</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of women have been dubbed &#8216;a wild pack of Karens&#8217; after they staged an anti-mask rally outside a California supermarket&#8230;.<strong>The women became enraged by the fact that they were unable to shop without wearing face masks,</strong> with one even accusing Mother&#8217;s Market of committing &#8216;war crimes&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8230;.‘The citizens of United States are being denied access to food. This is a war crime! <strong>This is crimes against humanity happening right now at Mother&#8217;s Market &amp; Kitchen in Costa Mesa!’</strong> the narrator continues.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just go back to sleep. Somebody wake me up in a hundred years, OK?</p>

    <p>My thanks to Tara AI for sponsoring last week at DF. Most project management software (a) takes a lot of time to configure, (b) is not built for cross-functional teams, and (c) takes focus away from releases. The status quo is that engineers spend precious time wading through tickets.</p>

    <p>Acerbic YouTube take from Jim Sterling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screw the lot of them. Yes, Apple and Google need taking down from
their high towers. Yes, Epic Games has a point as it sues to keep
Fortnite on mobile devices. But absolutely all of them are as bad
as each other.</p>

<p>This isn’t my take, per se, but it’s a fair take.</p>

<h5>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Ed Snowden, the computer analyst and programmer who exposed the U.S. government&#39;s mass surveillance of American citizens , wearing an expression as blank and unreadable as the movie he’s starring in often is itself, Oliver Stone’s untypically understated, uncharacteristically romantic &quot;Snowden&quot;.</h5>
<p>Trump’s talking about pardoning Edward Snowden. As usual, it’s hard to know if he means it, or if it’s just something to get attention, or he’s trying to distract his voters from all the bad news they might be hearing about their hero-king. And there’s the question of who put the idea in his head and why now? Something else we’re hearing he’s been saying to aides is that he wants to meet with Putin before the election. Maybe Putin said something. Like “Please take this bore off our hands. We’re tired of paying his rent.” Whatever’s going on, it started me thinking about Snowden’s case and about him and reconsidering both. I’m a grudging admirer of Snowden. I don’t see him as either a hero or a martyr, but I don’t see him as a traitor and a villain either. I see him as the victim of his own naivete and his peculiar ideology, someone who wanted to do the right thing but didn’t really have a clear idea what the right thing was or how to go about doing it, done in by hubris and folly, an anti-hero in an ironic tragedy of his own making. But the image I have of him is in a large part drawn from Oliver Stone’s movie “Snowden” and Stone, to put it mildly, is often done in by his own peculiar ideology and hubris. So I should do some homework, including re-reading Snowden’s memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/permanent-record-edward-snowden/1132756213?ean=9781250772909&amp;aug=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Permanent Record”</a>, before I come to any new conclusions. In the meantime, I feel like it’s an opportune time to re-post my review of the movie, which I liked for the performances of its leads and supporting characters not so much for the movie itself---I thought Stone pulled his punches, something Stone isn’t known for doing. “Snowden” has more in common with more conventionally told, understated historical thrillers like “The Good Shepherd” or “American Sniper” than with “Nixon” or “JFK”, and what’s the point of going to an Oliver Stone movie if you’re not going to be punched in the face?</p>
<p>By the way, I left my favorite performance out of the review because I didn’t want to spoil the surprise of Nic Cage’s cameo. After four years, I think you’re allowed to include spoilers…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">_________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasn’t looking forward to seeing &quot;Snowden&quot;. With apologies to <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-oliver-stone-experience-matt-zoller-seitz/1123120241?ean=9781419717901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matt Zoller Seitz</a>, I’m not much of an Oliver Stone fan. I find his movies too...loud. And insistent. And he&#39;s too much of a believer in the idea of the Last Honest Man. I feel like all his movies tend to be about how one noble and innocent man, after temporarily losing his way, redeems himself by taking on and defeating the SYSTEM or in being defeated by it.</p>
<p>Of course that’s not entirely true. At any rate, it’s not true of &quot;Nixon&quot;.</p>
<p>But &quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, even &quot;Talk Radio&quot; fit the pattern. I probably could make the case that &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is his own dark parody of the same theme.</p>
<p>And hand in glove with the Last Honest Man theme is Stone’s vision of America as a generally dark and sinister place ruled by a shadowy and corrupt elite made up of ruthless and power-hungry schemers, thieves, mass murderers, and madmen, and in that &quot;Nixon&quot; does fit the pattern. Richard Nixon and Nixon’s America are the implicit or explicit evils at work in all those other movies.</p>
<p>There are too many days when I agree with Stone on this and it’s one of the things I go to the movies to escape, that grim, cynical, despairing sense that Nixon won.</p>
<p>So I was expecting more of the same from &quot;Snowden&quot;. But it wasn’t just the existential dread I was dreading.</p>
<p>I was dreading that Stone would try to make a hero of Edward Snowden, and I just can’t bring myself to think of Snowden as a hero.</p>
<p>This says more about my own orneriness than about anything else. I think a lot of liberals need to see Snowden as a hero the way a lot of conservatives needed to see Chris Kyle as a hero. And I want no part of that. They’re both too complicated, flawed, and all too human. I’ve always seen Snowden as an idealistic and well-meaning but naive young man who tried to do a good thing, by his lights, and did it badly in a way that ended up screwing himself and tainting his cause.</p>
<p>I’ve also never been sure exactly what good he hoped to do or how much good he actually accomplished.</p>
<p>I don’t know which side in the debate to trust. The government’s argument has been we need to do what we’re doing in order to stop the terrorists but don’t worry we’re not overstepping, which is not the kind of reassurance the government should expect people to just accept. What government has ever not overstepped? And no evidence that spying on everybody worked or that it was necessary. It didn’t help get bin Laden and the major terrorist threats that we know failed---the shoe bomb that didn’t go off, the underwear bomb that didn’t go off, the Times Square bomb that didn’t go off---were thwarted mainly by accident and the terrorists’ own incompetence.</p>
<p>On the other side, the argument seemed to be that nothing the government did to protect us was worth the assault on our civil rights and privacy---brave words, but seemed to me to come out of a sense that there was nothing to protect us from.</p>
<p>I figured I’d sit through the movie feeling as frustrated and manipulated and pulled in too many directions by the story Stone was telling as I’d felt by the real story as I heard it told in the news and online all along.</p>
<p>Didn’t seem like a fun way to spend a couple hours.</p>
<p>In the end I felt I had to go so I could write about it in order to maintain my standing as a dutiful liberal blogger. In other words, I went as homework. Not the best reason to go to a movie.</p>
<p>Turned out it wasn’t the kind of Oliver Stone movie I was dreading. It wasn’t loud. It was even nuanced. And parts of it were quite...sweet.</p>
<p>A nice surprise, at the beginning. By the midway point, though, I was wishing it was more of that kind of Oliver Stone movie simply because that would have been more exciting and fun. As it is, &quot;Snowden&quot; is as low-key, reticent, unforthcoming, emotionally reserved to the point of repressed, and monotonous as its portrayal of Edward Snowden himself.</p>
<p>But...while in many ways it still is a typical Oliver Stone movie, including its being about another Last Honest Man, whether or not it’s a typical Oliver Stone movie and whether or not I’m an Oliver Stone fan doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan and &quot;Snowden&quot; features what’s becoming a typically excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance.</p>
<p>An excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance doesn’t mean an excellent movie. It just means a movie that’s at least worth watching for Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s performance.</p>
<p>Gordon-Levitt’s Snowden is watchful, self-contained, maybe not emotionally repressed but definitely willfully undemonstrative. He rarely seems to smile on his own volition. A smile is a reflexive reaction he should have controlled. When he’s made to smile---and it’s always as if been made to, against his will and better judgement---there’s a look in his eye that’s partly regret and partly amused admiration for whatever or whoever’s forced him to smile, as if he’s been fooled by a card trick he should have known better than to fall for but he still can’t help enjoying the trick and having been tricked in spite of himself. And talks openly only a little more often than he smiles. He says only what he has to say. He has a vibrant inner life but he’s determined to keep it to himself. He’s an intellectual and a voracious reader. He thinks deeply and philosophically about what he reads. But you have to work hard to get him to talk about it. You have to work hard to get him to talk, period. When he does speak it’s with a slight, barely perceptible hesitation, and with a studying look in his eyes, as if he’s scouting the path a sentence is going to take for holes to avoid stepping in and roots to avoid tripping over. It’s as if he’s hooked himself up to an inner lie detector test to ensure that everything he’s about to say---and feel---is truthful and accurate. A conversation style that cuts down on small talk. That’s the point. Talking just for the sake of talking is when you’re likely to give yourself away.</p>
<p>Not that Snowden has anything to hide---when we first meet him, at any rate. He’s not deceitful. He’s not particularly shy, either, and not naturally taciturn. His reticence is more like a point of principle. His business is his business, and yours is yours. He’s the living embodiment of the principle he’s ultimately going to ruin his life defending. No one gets to pry into anyone else’s life without explicit, specific, and limited permission.</p>
<p>Conversations should be about practical matters at hand, and he’s not just willing but eager to talk about those. He’ll gladly go into detail about what he’s working on---if you have the security clearance and he’s judged you smart enough and competent enough to follow him. He just won’t tell you why he’s working on it and for whom he’s doing the work.</p>
<p>Temperamentally, intellectually, emotionally, and, as it turns out, politically and ideologically he’s suited for working for the NSA and the CIA, which is to say essentially as a spy and an eager volunteer in the cyberwar on terror. Edward Snowden, I was surprised to learn, was a Republican and a libertarian when he started out in the intelligence business.</p>
<p>The problem, he learns to his own dismay, is that the nature of the work he has to do, and wants to do, and is proud to do and be able to do, is in conflict with his own nature.</p>
<p>As it happens, at this critical point in his life he falls in love with someone who in her own way is as all wrong for him as it’s becoming clear his job is all wrong for him.</p>
<p>His job requires him to treat everyone else’s business--and it’s literally everyone else’s business---as his business. Being in love with the politically liberal artist and professional free-spirit Lindsay Mills, played charmingly, exuberantly, and winsomely---but not too winsomely ---by Shailene Woodley, means allowing his business to become her business and through her the business of everyone else or, at any rate, anyone else she whimsically decides to share it with it and, given her nature, that could mean literally everyone else.</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If Snowden’s motto is “Nothing about me is your business”, hers is “Everything about me is not only your business but something I expect you’ll find totally fascinating.”</p>
<p>Good liberal that she is, she isn’t the least bit worried about the government’s spying on her or on anybody because she not only doesn’t have anything incriminating to hide, she doesn’t hide anything. She puts her whole life online, practically uploading her soul and personality, a virtual her who’s even more open and free-spirited and uninhibited as the analog her.</p>
<p>She’s an exhibitionist. Her whole life is a work of performance art. Multi-talented, her art of the moment is photography and she’s using her camera to chronicle her life. Snowden, as an important part of her life, is an important part of the chronicle. He must be photographed. Continually. He’s her favorite model. She adores him as a person so she adores him as a subject. He has to perform for her. For her camera, at any rate. He has to smile. And despite himself, he does. He even begins to enjoy it, both smiling and performing for her.</p>
<p>So, even though at first glance in one way she’s all wrong for him, she’s in this way just right for him. She frees him up to be more himself. She brings him out of himself, gets him out and about in the world, shows him how to have fun and enjoy what life offers beyond work. It’s the old, old story going back to Pride and Prejudice. Creative and intelligent and passionate free-spirited young woman finds true love and happiness by saving a dour, emotionally repressed, all work and no play from himself and the stodgy, conventional boring life he’s headed for. It’s an old story but a good story.</p>
<p>Trouble is it’s usually a funny story.</p>
<p>&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a comedy. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, another version, is a farce. Buried in &quot;Snowden&quot; is a comedy that could be called &quot;Along Came Lindsay&quot;. Ed Snowden is a Mister Darcy who’s a genius computer programmer addicted to his work. Lindsay Mills is an Elizabeth Bennett who takes nude selfies and posts them on the internet. They get together, despite themselves, and live happily if somewhat complicatedly ever after.</p>
<p>This would be fine if only the story around them had also been a comedy. It could have been one too, if Stone had chosen to see it that way. There is something farcical about the government’s “Let’s spy on everybody!” plan to combat terror. And the character who serves as the movie’s central villain, a CIA operative named O’Brian and Snowden’s suave and sophisticated but sinister mentor, brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans, is in essence a comic villain.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-pi"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-640wi" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" /></a></p>
<p>With his long lupine face topped off by snow white hair combed boyishly forward, he looks like Draco Malfoy whom no one has told is now middle-aged and a lot less pretty than he was when he and Harry Potter last crossed wands---an effect probably emphasized in my mind by Gordon-Levitt’s looking as though the part of Snowden was between him and Daniel Radcliffe and Stone told him he’d only cast him if he played it as a grown-up and grown Severus Snape-grim Harry. O’Brian’s improbable hair cut hints at the man’s vanity as well as his phoniness.</p>
<p>Feeling professionally obligated to keep his true self hidden and to appear in the world in disguise, he’s chosen for his primary false identity to disguise himself as someone twenty years younger. In another of his guises, he’s a Hemingwayesque outdoorsman and hunter. (For this one he wears a Stetson that looks as improbable on him as the haircut.) He’s also, at various times, a <em>bon vivant</em> and man of the world and a country club-style hale fellow well met type of 19th hole regular as gregarious and sycophantic as if he’s congratulating business contacts he’s let beat him at golf. (This one seems to be real in that it’s something he really does as part of his spy craft.)</p>
<p>The role he plays most often with Snowden is that of wise to the ways of the world and magic wizard instructing an apprentice, Merlin to Snowden’s Arthur, Dumbledore to Harry, Obi-wan---the haircut is also reminiscent of Alec Guinness’s wig in the original Star Wars movies---to his Luke.</p>
<p>All of these disguises are self-flattering and self-aggrandizing and there’s comedy to be found in his inflated view of himself. But it’s also a wonder that he can keep them all straight and doesn’t occasionally play the wrong part at the wrong time for the wrong audience and that could have been funny, his getting mixed up from time to time. A few more good jokes and with Stone pushing him to ham it up a bit more---or giving him permission to. Ifans probably wouldn’t have needed much prodding or direction. He is British, after all, (Well, Welsh, technically, but so was Burton) and the Brits are taught how to be hams as part of their basic training as actors.---and O’Brian would have been a funny bad guy.</p>
<p>But even though there are funny moments in &quot;Snowden&quot;, Stone doesn’t find any of the larger story amusing. That’s one of the reasons I’m not a fan. There’s never much he finds amusing. That’s ok, though. Not all love stories are comedies. Young lovers who would have had happy endings if only the grown-ups had stayed out of it are regularly in story and song brought to sorrow and grief. (See &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.) For stretches of the movie, it looks as though that’s what’s going to happen to Snowden and Mills. His work is going to break them up, break their spirits, and break their hearts. There’s even a tragic flaw within their love for each other that would have helped that to happen.</p>
<p>As good as she is for him in one way, she’s bad for him in another, because, despite her being a liberal hippie in comparison to him, she’s a spoiled rich girl used to living well and traveling in the “right” social circles. His job allows for both and she likes that.</p>
<p>As O’Brian’s protege he’s invited into the homes of the Beltway elite where he meets and is taken a shine to by important and Very Serious People who are happy to boost his career. When he gives up government work only to go back to work for the government as a consultant, his salary jumps and he and Mills are suddenly very flush with money. At first, Snowden’s not impressed by either the money or the social advancement. But he is impressed by how it makes her happy. And, under her influence, he begins to like it too, both the money and the social success.</p>
<p>On top of this, Mills is a bit of a vicarious thrill-seeker and she pushes him to go out into the field and do some actual spying.</p>
<p>This leads to what I think is the best section of &quot;Snowden&quot;, almost a movie within the movie that could have been expanded into the plot of an entire Hitchcockinan thriller focused wholly Snowden and Mills as a pair of innocents caught up in intrigue and adventure.</p>
<p>Snowden is sent to Austria---setting of &quot;The Third Man&quot;---where he teams up with a charming but oily, hedonistic, and morally bankrupt operative, played by a leering and cheerfully dissolute Timothy Olyphant to manipulate an innocent banker into giving them information about a would-be terrorist. The banker isn’t connected to the terrorist himself. He has family connections who have connections to people who have connections to people who...you get the picture. He himself has no idea how he’s connected at such a remove, but Snowden and his partner get to those connections through his daughter. This leads to tragedy and Snowden’s first serious crisis of conscience.</p>
<p>There Stone had a story, if he’d wanted to tell it, about a pair of lovers who are tempted by money, status, and the pure thrill of behaving amorally and either fall into corruption or are saved from it by their own innate decency or the intervention of angels in human form, a tragedy or a comedy, whichever way he chose. He chose to go back to his main story about Snowden standing up to the System. That could have been a tragedy or a comedy too. Except for one hitch. Neither the tragedy nor the comedy happen because neither did happen.</p>
<p>You’d think that wouldn’t have been a problem for him since what really happened has never stopped him before from telling the story he wanted to tell and making the points he was determined to make.</p>
<p>But this time it did. Stone let himself be blocked by reality.</p>
<p>The real Snowden and Mills seem to be living out a romantic comedy. Who knows if they’ll live happily ever after, but from all appearances they’re living pretty happily in the here and now, despite the inconvenience of their Russian exile, a fate, by the way, the movie comes close to blaming on the Glenn Greenwald, the activist and blogger and columnist for the Guardian who advised Snowden at the time he decided to go public with what he knew about the mass surveillance and release the data he’d according to the law stolen from the U.S. Government. I’ll get to that in another post. The System gets taken down and Snowden and Mills survive as individuals and as a couple and Stone is left with a love story that’s neither comic nor tragic, just kind of sweet, interrupted too often by a not particularly dramatic historical drama.</p>
<p>Again, there’s a way he could have dealt with this. The one I suggested earlier. He could have the plot that surrounds the romance a comedy too or, at least, comedic.</p>
<p>For reasons I can only guess at, he didn’t do that. But then he didn’t do what I’d actually expected him to do. Treat the whole thing as a typical Oliver Stone overwrought melodrama.</p>
<p>There’s a surprising matter-of-factness to his storytelling in &quot;Snowden&quot;. A this happened, then this happened, then that happened straight-forwardness that not only cuts down on the suspense but causes the movie to resist emotional involvement.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to feel about all of this?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be a bit of a shrug.</p>
<p>Feel?</p>
<p>Ok. Then how about think? What are we supposed to think?</p>
<p>Another shrug.</p>
<p>I was dreading going to &quot;Snowden&quot; because I expected Stone would try to be as emotionally manipulative and intellectually dishonest---in the cause of dragging the audience to the right side---as he’s often been. I didn’t want to be imaginatively wrestled into taking Snowden’s side and cheering him on as a hero. But I think I would have enjoyed that better.</p>
<p>Stone seems to be way too willing to let the facts speak for themselves for once. In truth, he seems barely interested in presenting the facts at all. At any rate, he doesn’t do much to dramatize them, let alone over-dramatize them in keeping with what I’ve always thought is his idiom. He appears to take it for granted we know all we need to know about the government’s massive data gathering enterprises and that we disapprove on intellectual, constitutional, and moral grounds, and he doesn’t have to work to make us disapprove.</p>
<p>The result is some rather desultory storytelling with many confusing and lazy plot twists and turns. Details and events have to be left out, compressed, or elided in all historical movies for the sake of time and in order not to overwhelm the audience with facts as if in a well-meaning but counterproductive effort to help us cram for a final exam. But in &quot;Snowden&quot; those left-out details and events aren’t compensated for either imagistically or through poetic license. This happened, then that happened, then...this happened. Wait? What? How did we get to that last this happened? What happened during the ellipses?</p>
<p>We’ll have to go back and read the books.</p>
<p>As for Snowden and what good he did...or harm…</p>
<p>On this point, as with the other, Stone seems to take it for granted that since we already agree that what the government was doing was wrong on principle, then we already agree that what Snowden did to put a stop to it was right on principle, and therefore Snowden is a champion of truth, justice, and the American way, on principle, and we will cheer for him in the end, on principle.</p>
<p>I don’t like to go to movies on principle. I went to this one on the principle I needed to do my homework for the blog and I wasn’t looking forward to being manipulated. But I would rather be manipulated into cheering for the hero than being expected to do it on principle. And that’s what I missed most watching &quot;&quot;Snowden, Stone’s old manipulative tricks.</p>
<p>I missed his special pleadings. I missed his tampering with history and the histrionics that usually go with it. I missed his very dark view of America. The government as presented in &quot;Snowden&quot; is generally incompetent while being too competent at the wrong things, corrupt but only routinely so and mainly because individual actors are corrupt, and generally wrongheaded to the point of stupidity. Which is why I think it could have been treated comically. But it isn’t actively evil. And it isn’t anybody, really. President Obama appears in clips that show him saying things we now know were official lies. But that’s all they are, official lies of the sort any and all political leaders engage in as a matter of course. There’s no George W. Bush here, no Dick Cheney. I didn’t miss them, particularly. But I missed there being real villains.</p>
<p>Especially the chief villain of Stone’s dark vision.</p>
<p>I missed Nixon.</p>

<p><strong>How to comfort someone</strong><br />
I think being able to make someone feel better is a superpower and one that I often fail at when I go into problem-solving mode too soon. This article outlines “<a href="https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2020/07/29/The-Four-States-of-Distress-how-to-comfort-someone-when-something-bad-happens-to-them?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">The Four States of Distress</a>” — 1. Shocked. 2. Feeling bad and not wanting to feel better. 3. Ready to feel better. 4. Feeling better and needing solutions. — and suggests the most helpful actions you can take to comfort someone at each state. It also shines a light on “comfort languages,” and after some thought, I recognized my comfort language is having someone help me explore and understand my feelings (and distraction helps too!). — CD</p>
<p><strong>Super comfortable slippers I can wear outside</strong><br />
I rarely drive anywhere these days, and aside from taking walks a couple of times a day in the neighborhood, I’m sheltering in place. I decided to give my feet a break and I’m wearing slippers instead of shoes around the house. These $15 <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/rockdove-men-s-original-two-tone-memory-foam-slippers-dark-gray-blue-size-9-10?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">memory foam slippers from RockDove</a> have an open back that makes them easy to slip on and kick-off, and the memory foam insoles are incredibly comfortable. Importantly they have a thick waterproof sole, so I can wear them in the backyard. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Free music soundtracks for video</strong><br />
The secret sauce for successful film- and video-making is the audio. The easiest way to add a musical score and sound effects to home-made video, particularly if you will be uploading it to YouTube, is to use the large collection of license-free music and effects in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCht8qITGkBvXKsR1Byln-wA?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">YouTube Audio</a> library. It’s free. Many tracks are pretty good. And the music is guaranteed to be “clear” and not cause copyright or monetization issues on YouTube. I’ve been using them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLr3Q2Qayr1ANe72ystgWXp9j3qIYkRinJ&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;v=RPM6uXxPD-w" target="_blank">on my videos</a>. — KK</p>

    <p>Donald Trump loves to fill vacant positions by simply appointing acting officials, thus bypassing the Senate confirmation process that he finds so annoying. Unfortunately for him, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/top-dhs-officials-wolf-cuccinelli-are-not-legally-eligible-serve-their-current-roles-congressional-watchdog-agency-finds/">that&#8217;s not always legal:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top two officials at the Department of Homeland Security are serving unlawfully in their roles, the Government Accountability Office said Friday, dealing a rebuke to President Trump’s affinity for filling senior executive roles in his administration with “acting” leaders who lack Senate confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good for the GAO, but how many divisions do they have? This is a president who&#8217;s deliberately wrecking the post office to gain a partisan advantage over Democrats. He sent domestic troops to Portland to create chaos that would help sell his law-and-order campaign theme. He&#8217;s pulled the birther card against Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and now Kamala Harris. He had protesters near the White House gassed so he could do a photo op. He pardons his pals even if they&#8217;ve committed crimes so obvious that even Bill Barr calls their prosecution righteous. He retweets lunatic QAnon conspiracies. He tried to get a foreign leader to open a criminal investigation of a political opponent. He has relentlessly tried to undermine the census. And he&#8217;s done all this stuff without a peep of protest from anyone in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So what are the odds that anyone will try to make him obey the law now? About zero, I think.</p>

    <p>Ari Sen and Brandy Zadrozny, reporting for NBC News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An internal investigation by Facebook has uncovered thousands of
groups and pages, with millions of members and followers, that
support the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to internal company
documents reviewed by NBC News. […]</p>

<p>Facebook and other platforms face a unique challenge in moderating
QAnon communities, said Joan Donovan, director of the Kennedy
School’s Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy at
Harvard. The platforms act both as the “base infrastructure” for
networking and spreading content and a target of the conspiracy
theory itself, which frames Facebook and other platforms as
“oppressive regimes that seek to destroy truth,” Donovan said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were rightwing kook conspiracy cults before Facebook, but Facebook uniquely enables them to grow. QAnon’s existence isn’t Facebook’s fault; QAnon’s prominence is entirely Facebook’s fault.</p>

<p>And they know it. From the same story, italic emphasis added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enforcing against QAnon on Facebook is not new: we consistently
take action against accounts, Groups, and Pages tied to QAnon that
break our rules. Just last week, we removed a large Group with
QAnon affiliations for violating our content policies, and removed
a network of accounts for violating our policies against
coordinated inauthentic behavior,” the spokesperson, <em>who asked
not to be named for fear of harassment from the QAnon community</em>,
wrote in an emailed statement. “We have teams assessing our
policies against QAnon and are currently exploring additional
actions we can take.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How fucked up is it that Facebook has any tolerance at all for a large subculture on their platform that their own spokespeople fear?</p>

<p>Just kick them all off, close every one of the groups and close the Facebook accounts of everyone prominent in the community.</p>

    <p>Margaret Sullivan, media columnist for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what about next week and next month?</p>

<p>Can something as dull-sounding as the workings of the Post Office
compete with former Trump attorney’s new tell-all book, whose
foreword includes lines like: “From golden showers in a sex club
in Vegas, to tax fraud, to deals with corrupt officials from the
former Soviet Union, to catch and kill conspiracies to silence
Trump’s clandestine lovers, I wasn’t just a witness to the
president’s rise — I was an active and eager participant.”</p>

<p>Can it break into the endless political takes on Kamala D. Harris
as Joe Biden’s running mate, or the next political horse-race
story that’s around the corner?</p>

<p>Fat chance.</p>

<p>But if journalists don’t keep the pressure on Postal Service
problems, they will be abdicating their duty. There’s very little
that matters more than the Nov. 3 vote. Anything that threatens
the integrity of the vote needs to be treated as one of the
biggest stories out there — even if it’s not the sexiest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just anecdotally, our mail situation here in Philadelphia has been <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mail-voting-phiadelphia-post-office-delays-20200806.html">just jaw-droppingly atrocious</a> the last 6 weeks or so. Important bills that just never show up, deliveries showing up weeks late. Never seen anything like it, and I’ve lived here for 30 years now.</p>

    <p>The COVID-19 charts were up late today, but there was a good reason: I stayed up all night hoping to do some Milky Way photography, and then slept in until 11 after I got home. So how did I do?</p>
<p>Badly. The whole trip was a complete bust. I tried a new spot on Palomar Mountain and there was just too much light there. Also, the sky was cloudy despite my astro-app telling me the sky would be clear. And even if it had been clear, it just wasn&#8217;t a good night for viewing. I could barely even see the Milky Way, let alone photograph it.</p>
<p>So instead I switched gears and took pictures of the clouds. My original goal had been to take multiple shots of the Milky Way and stitch them together, thus getting a single image that showed it from end to end. Instead, I did this for the sky as I found it. This one is eight frames stitched together:</p>

<p>This picture has a certain charm, but it&#8217;s very long and thin, which wasn&#8217;t my intention. I did take a series of pictures with the camera pointed higher, but I somehow screwed up the middle batch and this was enough to cause Photoshop to choke when it tried to merge them. So the bottom series of photos is all I have.</p>
<p>A few miles away I took this picture of a cityscape. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t really know just what city this is. Judging from the position of Venus, my best guess is Warner Springs:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859361"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1300px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859361" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="558" srcset="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg 2000w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=321,138 321w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=630,271 630w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=1536,660 1536w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=50,21 50w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=1300,558 1300w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=990,425 990w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=642,276 642w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="media-credit">August 15, 2020 — Near Palomar Mountain, California</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is three photos stitched together. I took a second series with a different exposure to get a better rendition of the cityscape, but for some reason Photoshop wouldn&#8217;t merge them. They were nearly identical to the first set, so I don&#8217;t know what happened.</p>
<p>One of these days I need to get a better idea of what the Photomerge function needs to work properly. It almost randomly seems to work on some sets of images and choke on others. When it fails, I always check the images to see if there&#8217;s plenty of overlap, and there always is. So what&#8217;s up?</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/abandoned_mall2.jpeg" alt="Abandoned shopping mall" width="800" height="400" /></p>
<p>Last year I wrote a post about being a <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/10/09/computational-survivalist/">computational survivalist</a>, someone able to get their work done with just basic command line tools when necessary. This post will be a different take on the same theme.</p>
<p>I just got a laptop from an extremely security-conscious client. I assume it runs Windows 10 and that I will not be able to install any software without an act of Congress. I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t booted it up. And in fact I <em>cannot</em> boot it up yet because I don&#8217;t have the badge yet to unlock it.</p>
<p>If being able to work with just default command line tools is like wilderness survival, being able to work with only consumer software is like urban survival, like trying to live in an abandoned shopping mall.</p>
<p>There must be some scientific software on the laptop. I imagine I may have to re-implement from scratch some tools that aren&#8217;t installed. I&#8217;ve been in that situation before.</p>
<p>One time I was an expert witness on a legal case and had to review the other side&#8217;s software. I could only work on their laptop, from their attorney&#8217;s office, with no network connection and no phone. I could request some software to be installed before I arrived, so I asked them to put Python on the laptop. I could bring books into the room with the laptop, so I brought the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hdnqyx">Python Cookbook</a> with me.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, or <code>awk</code>, but you do have Perl, you and roll your own version of the utilities in a few lines of code. For example, see <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/06/12/perl-as-a-better-grep/">Perl as a better grep</a>.</p>
<p>I always use LaTeX for writing math, but the equation editor in Microsoft Word supports a large amount of LaTeX syntax. Or at least it did when I last tried it <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/07/15/microsoft-word-equation-editor/">a decade ago</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows command line has more Unix-like utilities than you might imagine. Several times I&#8217;ve typed a Unix command at the Windows <code>cmd.exe</code> prompt, thought &#8220;Oh wait. I&#8217;m on Windows, so that won&#8217;t work,&#8221; and the command works. The biggest difference between the Windows and Linux command lines is not the utilities per se. You can install many of the utilities, say through <a href="https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki">GOW</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference in command lines is that on Windows, each utility parses its own arguments, whereas on Linux the shell parses the arguments first and passes the result to the utilities. So, for example, passing multiple files to a utility may or may not work on Windows, depending on the capability of the utility. On Linux, this just works because it is the shell itself rather than the utilities launched from the shell that orchestrates the workflow.</p>
<p>I expect this new project will be very interesting, and worth putting up with the minor annoyances of not having my preferred tools at my fingertips. And maybe it won&#8217;t be as hard as I imagine to request new software. If not, it can be fun to explore workarounds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a guilty pleasure to find a way to get by without the right tool for the job. It would be a waste of time under normal circumstances, and not something the client should be billed for, but you can hack with a clear conscience when you&#8217;re forced into doing so.</p>

<h5><strong><em><span style="color: #5b5b5b;">Carpe die</span>m!:</em></strong> Scene from &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; starring Robin Williams.</h5>
<p><em>Another very short essay from the <a href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/mining_the_notebooks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of In Search of Lost Time</a> as I try to catch up on my blogging: This one’s from April 1, 2020:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People see what they expect to see. They see what they want to see. That doesn’t mean that what they do see is an illusion or a delusion. It means there are gaps. They haven&#39;t picked up all the pieces. Our minds put together the scene our eyes are taking in like a puzzle that doesn’t need all the pieces to look complete. That’s usually enough to get us safely through the moment. But not often enough to assess what else is going on and come to conclusions about what any of it means. We have to take that into account, and look around us from many angles. We have to climb up on the desk with Robin Williams in “Dead Poets Society.” Even we liberals in the reality-based community have trouble remembering to do this and have to keep reminding ourselves. But conservatives don’t do this. One quick look around them from where they complacently sit is enough. Self-satisfaction in their single viewpoint is a hallmark of conservatives. It’s what makes them conservative. It’s why they stay conservative.</p>

    <p>Kyle Orland, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most if not all of the complaints Epic makes against Apple and
Google seem to apply to Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo in the
console space as well. All three console makers also take a
30-percent cut of all microtransaction sales on their platforms,
for example. […]</p>

<p>On mobile platforms, Epic is calling the same kind of 30-percent
fee “exorbitant” and says it wants to offer a more direct payment
solution so it can “pass along the savings to players.” On
consoles, though, Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">happily introduced a permanent 20-percent
discount</a> on all microtransaction purchases, despite there
being no sign that the console makers have changed their fee
structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. This is exactly the point I’ve been trying to make since the Xbox Game Pass controversy last week. Microsoft wants Apple to allow on iOS something they themselves will not allow on Xbox.</p>

<p>If you think Epic is right in principle about iOS and Android, then they ought to be making the same argument about Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. A computer is a computer. “Consoles” are a business model and user experience design choice, and the iPhone and iPad are effectively <em>app</em> consoles, where games are just one type of app. It’s a shame (in more ways than this) that Apple TV isn’t a bigger player, because it’s just another variant of iOS.</p>

<p>But instead of fighting the game consoles, Epic is taking <em>more</em> of a hit: Fortnite players on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch get the 20 percent reduction in price <em>while Epic still pays</em> the 30 percent cut of each transaction to the platform vendor. It’s a stunt, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Orland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe Epic just has a better relationship with console makers
than mobile phone makers. […]  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/9/21318965/sony-epic-games-investment-fortnite-unreal-engine">Sony recently invested $250
million in Epic</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/behind-the-scenes-of-that-incredible-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo/">prominently featured Epic’s Unreal Engine
5</a> in a recent major PlayStation 5 promotional demo, too. Even
Nintendo, which traditionally uses its own technology for game
development, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/7/14533324/nintendo-switch-unreal-engine-miyamoto">has begun using Unreal Engine for its own titles in
recent years</a>. In a way, Epic can’t attack these platform
holders without also attacking itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure that has nothing to do with it.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">A few big scoops from Mark Gurman yesterday</a> that got lost in the shuffle a bit after Epic went to war against the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino,
California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early
as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said. […]</p>

<p>There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package
will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive
variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming
service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier
bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Apple One” passes the sniff test as a credible name for the bundle. But this description, if accurate, seems contrary to the spirit of the name. It’s not just <em>one</em> bundle, which to me is what Apple ought to offer. What Gurman describes is a frustrating jumble of à la carte offerings that seems no different than the current situation, where every Apple subscription offering is a standalone service, other than some sort of discount for subscribing to more than one service, but only if you subscribe to them in certain predefined tiers.</p>

<p>What Gurman is describing would offer nothing, for example, if you want Apple Music/TV+ and additional iCloud storage but have no interest in Arcade or News+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company is also developing a new subscription for virtual
fitness classes that can be used via an app for the iPhone, iPad
and Apple TV, the people said. That service will be offered in a
higher-end bundle with the rest of Apple’s services. Codenamed
“Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered
by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.,
according to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This service simultaneously seems like a very keen offering from a company that is focused more and more on health and fitness features across its platforms (especially Watch) <em>and</em> more fuel to the fire that Apple unfairly competes against popular services from third parties.</p>

<p><strike>Total scoop for Gurman here if this pans out — this is the first anyone has reported this, I believe.</strike> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/09/apple-ios-14-fitness-app-guided-workouts/">MacRumors had a report on this back in March</a>, including the codename “Seymour”, but if it’s a paid subscription and not a free app, that’s still a scoop for Gurman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will
work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as
many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to
save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the
package chosen. For example, if a family subscribes today to all
of Apple’s major services plus the highest iCloud storage tier,
that would cost about $45 a month. A new bundle could knock more
than $5 off that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not much of a discount. To me the whole point of a bundle should be twofold: a greatly simplified offering (“<em>Just buy Apple One and get it all</em>”) at a <em>very</em> compelling price (“<em>Even if you don’t think you care about, say, Arcade and News+, hey, you’re effectively getting them for free</em>”.)</p>

<p>That’s the secret sauce to Amazon Prime. It’s a simple decision — get Prime or don’t — at a compelling price that makes everything other than the free shipping on Amazon purchases feel “free”.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1293892274875768832">Peter Kafka, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long-awaited/predicted Apple bundles, coming this fall. The
problem: Bundles work when they include the thing people
love/want/need — sports for cable tv, free delivery for Amazon.
These bundles — per Bloomberg, are made up of Apple’s side gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great bundle offering does have a lynchpin. And while Prime and cable TV are good examples of that, they’re at extremes pricing-wise. Prime makes it feel like a good deal for shipping and everything else is free; cable TV makes it feel like you’re paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels you never watch just to get the ones you do (sports or otherwise).</p>

<p>So let’s think this through and figure out what Apple One “should” include and cost.</p>

<p>The big difference with Apple’s services is that everything is a standalone service, with reasonable à la carte pricing. Arcade and TV+ are just $5/month, including automatic family sharing. News+ is $10/month, including sharing. Music is $10 individually, and $15/month for a family sharing account. Music and News+ cost more (and Music, alone among Apple’s content offerings, charges extra for family sharing) because Apple doesn’t own the content.</p>

<p>Then there’s iCloud, the paid storage tiers for which haven’t changed in years. Right now in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 GB: $1/mo</li>
<li>200 GB: $3/mo</li>
<li>2 TB: $10/mo</li>
</ul>

<p>My back-of-the-envelope proposal is that Apple One should cost $15/month for an individual and $20/month for family sharing, and include: Music, TV+, Arcade, and the top tier of iCloud storage. Make News+ a $5/add-on.</p>

<p>Basically: start with Apple Music as the lynchpin service in the bundle, charge $5 more than they currently are for Music alone, and include everything Apple owns the entirety of: TV+, Arcade, and iCloud storage. I think they have to charge extra for News+ to pay the participating providers — News+ is more like a bundle unto itself. And that still leaves <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209670">TV Channels</a> as extra monthly add-ons, too. What Gurman describes sounds basically like “<em>Pay for a bunch of services on top of Apple Music, get one of them free</em>”; what I’m suggesting is more “<em>Pay for one additional service on top of Apple Music, get the rest free</em>”.</p>

<p>That would make for a simple proposition at a compelling price.</p>
