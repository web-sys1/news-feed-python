    <p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">In 1960, when he was still in his 30s and already a renowned novelist, Norman Mailer wrote about that year’s Democratic National Convention in an article for <em>Esquire</em> magazine. Mailer’s article was called “<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">Superman Comes to the Supermarket</a>,” and it was later hailed as one of the most important forebears of the <a href="https://longreads.com/2015/04/01/tom-wolfe-on-the-birth-of-the-new-journalism/">“New Journalism”</a> movement of the ’60s and ’70s. Mailer was never known for understatement, and he declared in this article—written after John F. Kennedy had won the Democratic nomination, but before he had edged past Richard Nixon to win the presidency—that the 1960 DNC in Los Angeles, larded as always with forgettable political speeches, might turn out to be “one of the most important conventions in America’s history, it could prove conceivably to be the most important.”</p><p dir="ltr">Why and how? Mailer’s answer sprawled out over 14,000 words of observation, meditation, and digression. But the argument centered on the nature of the man the Democrats had chosen. The glistening young Kennedy—still then an aspirant, not yet an icon of history—was “unlike any politician who had ever run for President in the history of the land, and if elected he would come to power in a year when America was in danger of drifting into a profound decline.”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><blockquote>He carried himself nonetheless with a cool grace which seemed indifferent to applause, his manner somehow similar to the poise of a fine boxer, quick with his hands, neat in his timing, and two feet away from his corner when the bell ended the round. …</blockquote><blockquote>There was an elusive detachment to everything he did.</blockquote><p></p><p dir="ltr">There is so very much more in this piece, which you can read in its full immensity <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">at the <em>Esquire</em> site</a>. (Jay Rosen wrote a wonderful, <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2004/07/21/mailer_con.html">detailed assessment of the piece</a>, back in 2004.) But during this past week’s convention, I thought of that one word in Mailer’s description: cool. Conventions have long been “hot”—loud, unsubtle, the political version of infomercials. The Democrats were forced by the pandemic to be cool, and every political gathering from now on will have to reckon with how effective they were. Starting this coming week, with the Republicans.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/democrats-nail-covid-convention/615442/?utm_source=feed">David Frum: Democrats nail the coronavirus convention</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">In the mid-’60s, Marshall McLuhan offered his <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media">famous delineation</a> of “hot” versus “cool” media. To oversimplify and put it in contemporary terms, hot media would be the infomercial salesman barking at you “Wait, there’s more!” in a 3 a.m. cable-TV spot. Cool media would be a storytelling podcast, inviting (and requiring) the listener to fill in the details of imagined scenes beyond what the narrator spells out.</p><p dir="ltr">That Kennedy was <em>cool</em>—not just in his look and personality but also in his approach to politics and persuasion—was one of many marker points in our political history. Obviously, not all politicians who came after Kennedy could match his cool, or even want to try. (As a rule, Americans tend to choose as the next president someone seen as correcting the flaws of the current one. This often leads to our sequence of temperamental and stylistic opposites: Ronald Reagan, after Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton, after the first George Bush. Barack Obama, after the second George Bush. And then …) But everyone who followed Kennedy had to be aware of what he had done and how he had changed the terrain.</p><p dir="ltr">Mailer couldn’t have known any of this when he wrote. But he set out the idea that there could be political changes few people fully imagine before they occur—but that seem almost inevitable once they have happened. Sixty years after Kennedy’s convention, I think we may have seen another such shift.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">Traditional conventions, with thousands of participants, scores of speakers, and countless opportunities to punditize and to schmooze, have been beloved by two kinds of people. Actually, they’re one kind—those whose business takes them to conventions—divided in two. One group is reporters who, like me, love the idea of seeing parts of history directly, with our own eyes, while mingling with others who share that passion. I consider myself lucky to have seen, in person, moments as consequential as the young Barack Obama making his debut at the Democratic convention in Boston 16 years ago, and the triumphant Donald Trump giving his acceptance speech in Cleveland four years ago. The vibe in each room was powerful and unforgettable, in their very different ways. (The group around me on the convention floor in Cleveland spent most of the evening chanting “Lock her up!”)</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/democratic-conventions-big-blind-spot-economy/615547/?utm_source=feed">Read: The missing piece in Biden’s convention speech</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">The other group is the participants—elected officials, staffers, volunteers, hangers-on, those already famous and those getting their start. People who go to conventions go precisely because of their messy spectacle and sprawl. What we love about conventions we would have loved if we’d been there to hear William Jennings Bryan give his “Cross of Gold” speech at the Democratic convention in 1896, or to watch Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller duke it out at the Republican convention in 1964.</p><p dir="ltr">But most people are not like us. Most have viewed the hot, sweaty, noisy, unsubtle conventions as inferior forms of entertainment, as out of date as William Jennings Bryan. Coverage hours have dwindled, and audiences have shrunk.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the virus, the Democrats couldn’t deliver the standard loud, sweaty fare. Now that their week is over, it’s “obvious” to everyone how much better, for nearly everyone, the streamlined, virtual approach is. Better for the party, in distilling a message (and not having it chopped up by procedural folderol or pundit assessments). Better for the viewer, in having their public issues presented in more varied, comprehensible, and simply interesting ways. Better with shorter speeches; better with less delay for ritualistic applause lines; better in pacing and tightness and focus. Better with presenters generally speaking <em>through</em> the camera, conversationally, to viewers one by one at home, rather than orating at a crowd. Better with more showing than telling, more explaining than lecturing. Just, better.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s obvious <em>now</em>—though I’m not aware of anyone predicting how much better a virtual convention would be, before it kicked off. (This is a point I discussed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/the-comedy-and-tragedy-of-virtual-live-events/615559/?utm_source=feed">last week on <em>Social Distance</em></a> with James Hamblin and Maeve Higgins.) And it will be obvious to the Republicans, as they ready their presentations for this week.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">How can what we’ve just seen from the DNC be considered “cool”? In simplest terms, because (compared with previous conventions, the Democrats were able to convey their themes more coherently than usual, with less old-fashioned speechifying about them.</p><p dir="ltr">In one way or another, every single minute of the DNC programming advanced one of these points or ideas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">the trademark slogan “Build Back Better,” which was the most normal-convention-like, and thus least memorable, of the whole affair;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Donald Trump is personally inadequate to the duties of office, yet also institutionally threatening;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Joe Biden is an imperfect but <em>decent</em> person, with whom you might disagree but whom you would probably like;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that America is badly wounded but is not finished;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that the Democrats are in this together and are not sniping at one another; and</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that you have to make sure to vote.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Think of the signature moments of these four nights, and how each was crafted to explain, to show, to underscore one of these ideas. It is churlish to pick out any one segment as “most effective.” Was it the fabulous reimagination of the roll call of states, which practically guarantees that this will never be done in the traditional way again? (Except perhaps in this coming week.) Was it Ady Barkan speaking through a computer because of ALS; or Gabby Giffords still relearning how to speak, nine years after her shooting; or 13-year-old Brayden Harrington, magnificently persevering in his speech about stuttering? Was it Biden’s last major rival, Bernie Sanders, speaking with evident warmth for the man who defeated him, or the Zoom-style panel of primary contenders sharing their memories of the campaign? Was it Jill Biden telling her story, or Kamala Harris telling hers, or Michelle and Barack Obama with their quiet-toned but deadly earnest message about the stakes in voting this year? Was it the tribute to John Lewis or the talk from Elizabeth Warren in a schoolroom, with children’s blocks spelling out <em>BLM</em> behind her? Was it Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, on what it will take to deal with the pandemic, or Kristin Urquiza saying that her dead father’s “only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump,” or (as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/dnc-when-convention-takes-place-your-living-room/615535/?utm_source=feed">Megan Garber argued</a>) the “In Memoriam” reflection on the many lives that had been lost? Was it Joe Biden’s implicit rebuke, in his closing address, to the constant Republican refrain that he had lost too many steps?</p><p dir="ltr">Was it—you can go on down your own list. The point for now is that the political world has seen something it hadn’t been aware of one week ago. The Democrats were forced out of the old, and figured out the new. They went from a hot medium, to one that was cool. In terms of political style, Donald Trump is pure heat. The rallies, the tweets, the boasts, the jibes. We’re about to see whether the party he leads will recognize the changed terrain, and how it might respond.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p><strong>Granite-coated non-stick cookware</strong><br />
For years, my family has been using Le Creuset cast iron pans. The large one is almost too heavy for my wife to deal with. Also, they take a long time to heat up. While we are not ready to get rid of them, I recently discovered <a href="https://geni.us/carote?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Carote non-stick frying pans</a>. They’re coated with some kind of natural Granite material and they have a bakelite handle that stays cool (unlike the Le Creuset handles that get extremely hot). The aluminum Carote heats up quickly, and it is the best non-stick frying pan I’ve ever had. Everything just slides right out of it and it’s very easy to clean with water and a paper towel. you can try out the 8-inch frying pan, which costs under $15 to see if you like it before buying a larger pan. — MF</p>

      Posted on 23 August 2020 at 1:49&thinsp;am
      • John D. Cook

    </p></div>
    <p>Two polynomials <em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>q</em>(<em>x</em>) are said to be permutable if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>p</em>(<em>q</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>q</em>(<em>p</em>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>. It&#8217;s not hard to see that Chebyshev polynomials are permutable.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>) = cos (<em>n </em>arccos(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>where <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is the <em>n</em>th Chebyshev polyomial. You can take this as a definition, or if you prefer another approach to defining the Chebyshev polynomials it&#8217;s a theorem.</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s easy to show that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">cos(<em>m</em> arccos(cos(<em>n</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)))) = cos(<em>mn</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<p>Then the polynomials <em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> and <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> must be permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>) = <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more family of polynomials that are permutable, and that&#8217;s the power polynomials <em>x</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>. They are trivially permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(<em>x</em><sup><em>m</em></sup>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> = (<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>)<sup><em>m</em></sup>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Chebyshev polynomials and the power polynomials are essentially [1] the only permutable sequence of polynomials.</p>

    <p>I was looking up how to put a little Hebrew inside a LaTeX document and ran across a good answer on <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14777/whats-a-simple-way-to-typeset-a-small-amount-of-hebrew-content-using-tex/15550#15550">tex.stackexchange</a>. Short answer: use the <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/cjhebrew">cjhebrew</a> package.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you put your Hebrew text between <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> using the <code>cjhebrew</code> package&#8217;s transliteration. You write left-to-right, and the text will appear right-to-left. For example, <code>\&lt;'lp&gt;</code> produces</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/aleph_cjhebrew.png" alt="aleph in Hebrew" width="99" height="56" /></p>
<p>using &#8216; for א, l for ל, and p for ף.</p>
<p>The code for each Hebrew letter is its English transliteration, with three footnotes.</p>
<p>First, when two Hebrew letters roughly correspond to the same English letter, one form may have a dot in front of it. For example, ט and ת both make a <em>t</em> sound; the former is encoded as <code>.t</code> and the latter as <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>Second, five Hebrew letters have a different form when used at the end of a word [1]. For such letters the final form is the capitalized value of the regular form. For example, פ and its final form ף are denoted by <code>p</code> and <code>P</code> respectively. The package will automatically choose between regular and final forms, but you can override this by using the capital letter in the middle of a word or by using a <code>|</code> after a regular form at the end of a word.</p>
<p>Finally, the letter ש is written with a <code>/s</code> The author already used <code>s</code> for ס and <code>.s</code> for צ, so he needed a new symbol to encode a third letter corresponding to <em>s</em> [2]. Also ש has a couple other forms. The letter can make either the <em>sh</em> or <em>s</em> sound, and you may see dots on top of the letter to distinguish these. The <code>cjhebrew</code> package uses <code>+s</code> for ש with a dot on the top right, the <em>sh</em> sound, and <code>,s</code> for ש with a dot on the top left, the <em>s</em> sound.</p>
<p>Here is the complete consonant transliteration table from the <code>cjhebrew</code> documentation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/cjhebrew.png" width="878" height="216" /></p>
<p>Note that the code for א is a single quote <code>'</code> and the code for ע is a back tick (grave accent) <code>`</code>.</p>
<p>You can also add vowel points (<em>niqqud</em>). These are also represented by their transliteration to English sounds, with one exception. The sh&#8217;va is either silent or represents a schwa sound, so there&#8217;s not a convenient transliterations. But the sh&#8217;va looks like a colon, so it is represented by a colon. See the package documentation for more details.</p>

    <p>A few days ago <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-seriously-considers-capital-gains-tax-cut-heres-how-he-could-do-it-2020-08-11">President Trump said he was &#8220;seriously considering&#8221; a cut in the capital gains rate</a> if he&#8217;s re-elected. Needless to say, Trump says a lot of things, and the fact that he said this probably doesn&#8217;t mean much. Still, he was backed up by longtime capital gains warrior Larry Kudlow, who told reporters &#8220;We’d like to take it back to 15%, where it was for quite a long time because it helps jobs, investment, productivity and wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that true? First off, here&#8217;s the amateur view of whether capital gains rates have any effect on economic growth:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861073"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861073" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_capital_gains_gdp_growth.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="619"></figure>
<p>Hmmm. It sure doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like the capital gains rate has much correlation with real GDP growth. If anything, the trend lines are going in the wrong direction entirely: capital gains rates have been declining since 1960, but the only result has been a decline in GDP growth too. If low capital gains rates boost GDP, it sure doesn&#8217;t show up here.</p>
<p>But this is just playground stuff. Serious economists have far more sophisticated ways of figuring out if capital gains cuts lead to higher economic growth. So what do they say?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42729-orig.pdf">Congressional Research Service report</a> written in 2012 concludes that &#8220;neither the top marginal tax rate nor the top capital gains tax rate are strongly correlated with saving, investment, labor productivity, and GDP growth controlling for other covariates.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/raising-todays-low-capital-gains-tax-rates-could-promote-economic-efficiency-and-fairness#_ftnref6">Tax expert Joel Slemrod</a> says &#8220;there is no evidence that links aggregate economic performance to capital gains tax rates.&#8221;</li>
<li>A policy brief from the <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/capital-gains-taxes-and-economic-growth">Levy Economics Institute</a> finds &#8220;little theoretical or empirical basis for the view that lowering the capital gains tax rate would have a substantial effect on economic growth or level of economic activity.&#8221;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2019/11/21/policy-options-increase-tax-rates-on-capital-gains-amp-dividends">Penn Wharton Budget Model</a> calculates that an <em>increase</em> in the capital gains rate would have no negative effect on economic growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-019-09530-3">A pair of researchers at the University of Groningen</a> looked at capital gains rates worldwide and concluded that &#8220;Using a long cross-country panel data set going back to 1965 and employing a variety of econometric techniques, we document that greater reliance on capital taxation, measured in different ways, is not negatively associated with growth rates.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but why bother? There&#8217;s been a ton of research on this subject and it almost unanimously concludes that capital gains rates have a tiny effect at most on economic growth. On the other hand, when capital gains rates are different from ordinary tax rates they can cause serious mischief:</p>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/01/18/mitt-romneys-teachable-moment-on-capital-gains/#7aa1c0057a4e">Len Burman</a> says, &#8220;Virtually every individual income tax shelter is devoted to converting fully taxed income into capital gains.&#8221;</li>
<li>Capital gains tax cuts are regressive, with the benefits going almost exclusively to the rich. The <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/9-19-12tax.pdf">Tax Policy Center</a> estimates that 71 percent of the benefits go to the top one percent.<br />
<figure id="attachment_861081"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861081" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_capital_gains_benefits.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="922"></figure>
</li>
<li>Many affluent households earn a majority of their income in capital gains. This means that some of them actually have lower overall tax rates than middle-class households, who have to pay the ordinary income tax rate. Lowering the capital gains rate would only make this worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. It&#8217;s no surprise that rich people—and therefore the Republican Party—are in favor of reducing capital gains rates. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be? But there&#8217;s no reason for the other 99 percent of us to be in favor. It does the economy no good; it does us no good; and it motivates lots of inefficient gameplaying with taxes. It&#8217;s just another stupid con. Don&#8217;t fall for it if your income is anywhere below $200,000 or so.</p>

<p>All his life, from childhood into old age, Arthur Conan Doyle was as bold and adventurous as his literary creations and fictional dual alter egos Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. For him the game was always afoot. At one time the game was literally game, as in animals to be hunted, and those animals were not afoot but a-fin! As an impecunious twenty-two-year old med student, Doyle took time off from his studies to earn tuition money by signing on as a ship’s doctor aboard a whaler bound for the Arctic. He had a, um, whale of time. Oh, and about poisoning himself: he did that as part of a research experiment he was doing on the effects of a pain relief medicine derived from a toxic plant...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many dangers awaited Arthur at sea in the Arctic. Frequently he even found himself in the water. He fell off the slippery decks or icy floes often enough that the sardonic captain nicknamed him the “Great American Diver,” after the fishing bird known in North America as the common loon. As the medical man and an educated young gentleman, he was not expected to participate in the hunts. Eager for adventure and fond of blood sports, however, he rowed out to whales in impossibly tiny tossing boats, and looked a dying whale in the eye. He bludgeoned and skinned seals and shot walrus. He sent occasional reports home to his mother, telling her more details than most mothers would want to know, as if teasing her with the dangers and risks of this work he did not have to do---but which he embraced. Piercing cold, strangely lit nights, and alien creatures crept into his imagination. He had proved himself with common men and officers, had faced the cold and the darkness and grown stronger. The Arctic cowed him no more than the poison with which he had dosed him the year before.</p>

    <p>In his column today Paul Krugman flicked at a point about the &#8220;soaring&#8221; stock market that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/opinion/stock-market-unemployment.html">deserves a bit more attention:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent rise in the market has been largely driven by a small number of technology giants. And the market values of these companies have very little to do with their current profits, let alone the state of the economy in general. <strong>Instead, they’re all about investor perceptions of the fairly distant future.</strong></p>
<p>Take the example of Apple, with its $2 trillion valuation. Apple has a price-earnings ratio — the ratio of its market valuation to its profits — of about 33. One way to look at that number is that only around 3 percent of the value investors place on the company reflects the money they expect it to make over the course of the next year. <strong>As long as they expect Apple to be profitable years from now, they barely care what will happen to the U.S. economy over the next few quarters.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longtime readers know that when I say something &#8220;deserves a bit more attention,&#8221; that means you&#8217;re about to see a chart. Here it is:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861049"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1266px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861049" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_sp500_ex_tech.gif" alt="" width="1266" height="632"></figure>
<p>This is an S&amp;P 500 index with tech stocks removed and adjusted for inflation. You can see two things. First, over the past three years it&#8217;s not very impressive. Second, it plunged in March thanks to COVID-19 and has never recovered completely.</p>
<p>(And that&#8217;s even though this index includes powerhouses like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, none of which are categorized as &#8220;information technology.&#8221;)</p>
<p>In one sense you don&#8217;t want to make too much of this. You can always remove the top performer from a broad stock index and produce a weaker looking trend. Still, this is more dramatic than usual. This isn&#8217;t just weaker looking, it&#8217;s practically flat. The collective performance of literally everything in the United States is kind of dismal except for companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle.</p>
<p>So when someone asks why the stock market is doing so great even though we&#8217;re in the middle of a massive pandemic, this is part of the answer: it&#8217;s <em>not</em> doing so great. Aside from tech stocks, the market has been ho-hum over the past few years and is still down 4 percent from its pre-pandemic level. Investors obviously have some confidence that the economy will rebound once we approve a vaccine and the pandemic is finally sidelined—as they should—but they&#8217;re hardly being cheerleaders for the overall economy. They just like tech stocks.</p>

    <p>Devin Coldewey, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s filing challenges the TRO request on several grounds.
First, it contends that there is no real “emergency” or
“irreparable harm” because the entire situation was concocted and
voluntarily initiated by Epic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having decided that it would rather enjoy the benefits of the App
Store without paying for them, Epic has breached its contracts
with Apple, using its own customers and Apple’s users as
leverage.</p>

<p>But the “emergency” is entirely of Epic’s own making…it knew full
well what would happen and, in so doing, has knowingly and
purposefully created the harm to game players and developers it
now asks the Court to step in and remedy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple also questions the likelihood of Epic’s main lawsuit
(independent of the TRO request) succeeding on its merits — namely that Apple is exercising monopoly power in its
rent-collecting on the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Epic’s] logic would make monopolies of Microsoft, Sony and
Nintendo, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Epic’s antitrust theories, like its orchestrated campaign, are a
transparent veneer for its effort to co-opt for itself the
benefits of the App Store without paying or complying with
important requirements that are critical to protect user safety,
security, and privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see a lot of people arguing that iOS, in some ethical/moral/philosophical sense, is inherently a different sort of closed vendor-controlled computing platform than game consoles, but I don’t see a legal argument for how iOS constitutes a monopoly if Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch aren’t. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/sweeney_hand_waving_game_consoles_app_stores">Again</a>, you’re not going to see Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo filing amicus briefs on Epic’s behalf, even though Microsoft has a game streaming platform Apple’s won’t allow on iOS, and Sony and Nintendo <em>could</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/#entry-36">Apple’s full filing is available here</a>, and their attachments, including <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Phil Schiller’s declaration</a> and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/4/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Tim Sweeney’s laughably absurd “How about we make our own app store?” email</a>, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/#entry-37">are right below it</a>.</p>

    <p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, in a letter to Apple on June 30:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please confirm within two weeks if Apple agrees in principle to
allow Epic to provide a competing app store and competing payment
processing, in which case we will meet with your team to work out
the details including Epic’s firm commitment to utilize any such
features diligently to protect device security, customer privacy,
and a high-quality user experience. If we do not receive your
confirmation, we will understand that Apple is not willing to
make the changes necessary to allow us to provide Android
customers with the option of choosing their app store and payment
processing system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard to believe Apple didn’t go for this. Such careful copy-and-pasting makes for such a compelling argument.</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088">The WordPress founder says</a> the company has been unable to update its iOS app until it gives Apple a cut of its in-app purchases.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one small detail worth knowing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396316/apple-wordpress-in-app-purchase-tax-update-store">Sean Hollister at The Verge:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Here’s the thing: the WordPress app on iOS doesn’t sell anything. I just checked, and so did Stratechery’s Ben Thompson. The app simply lets you make a website for free. There isn’t even an option to buy a unique dot-com or even dot-blog domain name from the iPhone and iPad app — it simply assigns you a free WordPress domain name and 3GB of space.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is either a pretty ill-timed mistake from Apple, or whatever is going on with the App Store folks over there is way more out of hand than we knew. I hope it is the former, but given the incidents of the last few weeks, I think it&#8217;s harder than ever to give Apple the benefit of the doubt here.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems that WordPress app <em>did</em> run afoul of the rules. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/wordpress-ios-app-apple-blocked-updates/">Juli Clover:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  As it turns out, the WordPress app was in violation of Apple&#8217;s  App Store  policies because there were references to upgrading to paid plans within the app&#8217;s help system that linked to the WordPress plan option on the web, something which was not made clear when reports about the WordPress app being forced to implement in-app purchases came out.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s rules around this are still bad, but thankfully the WordPress situation wasn&#8217;t as terrible as it seemed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether there was an internal change in the last 18 months or if the mask has simply slipped, but Apple has made a lot of official statements lately that are really tone-deaf from the perspective of a developer. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand or value our contributions or remember that apps existed before the App Store.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/epic-games-sought-app-store-side-deal/"><p>According to Apple, Epic Games in June sought a special deal from Apple&rsquo;s Phil Schiller that would change the way in which Epic offers apps on the  App Store.

<p>It seems totally reasonable to ask for a special deal when other companies are clearly getting them (Schiller and Cook statements notwithstanding). Suing for special treatment would look bad, though, so Epic&rsquo;s lawsuit seeks to change the rules for everyone.</p>

    <p>Our beloved postmaster general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/21/us/dnc-convention-election">testified before the Senate today:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We will scour every plant each night leading up to Election Day,”</strong> Mr. DeJoy said in response to a question from Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, as he testified for over two hours before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee&#8230;.“There has been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,” Mr. DeJoy told the lawmakers, adding, <strong>“The Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the caveat that we should all keep a close eye on this stuff over the next couple of months, I think this represents an almost complete victory in the post office wars. It&#8217;s the handling and delivery of mail ballots that&#8217;s always been the biggest issue, not the dismantling of mail sorting machines, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">which has been ongoing for years:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purchased when letters and not packages made up a greater share of postal work, the bulky and aging machines can be expensive to maintain and take up floor space postal leaders say would be better devoted to boxes. Removing underused machines would make the overall system more efficient, postal leaders say. <strong>The USPS has cut back on mail-sorting equipment for years since mail volume began to decline in the 2000s.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 2001 was the peak year for first class mail volume, <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-since-1926.htm">which has declined by nearly half since then:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_860935"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-860935" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_first_class_mail_volume.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="619"></figure>
<p>Ditto for mailboxes, which are routinely removed if daily usage <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-remove-usps-mailboxes/">falls below 25 pieces of mail:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_860909"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1263px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-860909" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_number_mailboxes.gif" alt="" width="1263" height="634"></figure>
<p>The real issue has always been overtime rules and prioritization of mail ballots. A week ago the Postal Service was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">warning 46 states</a> that it couldn&#8217;t guarantee delivery of all mail ballots in time for the November election. If DeJoy is now saying he is &#8220;committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time,&#8221; that represents a major victory for the cause of voting by mail. At this point we just need to make sure he&#8217;s as good as his word.</p>

That sounded pretty impressive until I got hold of the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/ehs-07-2020-summary-2020-08-21.pdf">underlying data from the National Association of Realtors:</a></p>

<p>Technically, it&#8217;s true that existing home sales increased a lot from June to July. But the real story is less dramatic: home sales took a big hit when COVID-19 first hit and then recovered quickly. That might be an interesting story in itself, but it&#8217;s definitely not a story of booming home sales.</p>
<p>As always, beware of headlines that seem too good to be true.</p>

<p class=""> For years now, <a href="https://ulysses.app/promo/macsparky">I've been using Ulysses</a> for all of my serious writing projects, and I'm pleased to have Ulysses back as this week's sponsor. One of the things I like about Ulysses is that despite its many years of development (they recently released version 20), the Ulysses team is always looking for ways to make it better and willing to "go big" with changes if they can help their users with the hard work of writing.   </p><p class="">A great example of this is the recent changes they've made to the outline navigation tools. It has been relocated to the Mac's dashboard, and it's entirely new on iPhone and iPad.   </p><p class="">It's now one view that combines your outline, bookmarks, annotations, and links. I just wrote a lengthy legal document using these tools, and they are a marked improvement over the prior system. You can learn more about this feature over at the Ulysses blog. I'd add that you may want to <a href="https://blog.ulysses.app">keep up with the Ulysses blog</a> since they not only advise on using Ulysses but also offer some great general advice to help make writing easier.  </p><p class="">I'm invested in Ulysses. It just makes writing easier. For so many years, I wrote in apps that were about word processing, not <em>writing</em>. Ulysses is a <em>writing app</em> in every sense of the word. Go check out Ulysses today and start using an app that can help you make your words better. They’ve even got <a href="https://ulysses.app/promo/macsparky">a special offer for MacSparky Readers.</a></p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/ethernet-coax.jpg" /></p><p>I live in a sprawling house, extensively wired with coax cable throughout (but not with Cat 5). My mesh wi-fi works, but with five grownups living and working from home, I wanted a wired connection for the main workstations, teleconferencing spots, and Apple TVs. Re-wiring the house with Cat 5 was intrusive and expensive and the Ethernet over the power line didn&#8217;t work across the isolated circuits.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://geni.us/ethernet-coax">Ethernet-over-coax-cable converters</a>. I plugged one end of it into the coax cable in the basement near my Ethernet switch and the other end into the same cable in my office upstairs and it just worked. The spec says the bandwidth is up to 100Mbs, but I&#8217;m getting close to 200Mbs (which is what I get from my ISP anyway). I now have many of these and I have it for about 5 months and have no issues to report.</p>

    <p>With the economy in shock thanks to COVID-19, the obvious response from the federal government is to spend lots of money to cushion the blow. This would not only help out businesses and individuals—a worthy end in itself—but massive deficit spending would also help kick start the economy as a whole. Still, there&#8217;s a limit to how much we can blow up the deficit. The question is: What is that limit?</p>
<p>The downside of deficit spending is that if you do too much of it you&#8217;ll touch off a surge of inflation. This is what limits our tolerance for deficits when the economy is already in good shape. But what if the economy is in a deep recession? Then we should spend whatever it takes to get the economy fully back on its feet. There&#8217;s no reason to stop until we start to see signs of growing inflation.</p>
<p>So what about now? Obviously we&#8217;re in a deep recession that calls for enormous spending. Nonetheless, we need some touchstone that tells us if spending is out of hand and we&#8217;re running up deficits too quickly. That touchstone is inflationary expectations, and there are lots of ways of estimating it. Here&#8217;s a whole bunch of them. First off is what&#8217;s known as the 5-year/5-year forward inflation expectation rate:</p>

<p>Bottom line: Nobody, literally nobody, sees even the slightest inflationary pressure causing a problem over the next ten years. The average forecast for 1-10 years is under 2 percent, about the same as it&#8217;s been for the past decade.</p>
<p>But wait! What if all these forecasts are wrong? Then we&#8217;ll get plenty of warning. Inflationary expectations will rise steadily until they get to a point where policymakers need to start getting worried. Right now, though, we aren&#8217;t within light years of that. With an economy in the doldrums—and a worldwide economy that&#8217;s obviously not going to help us out—we should be spending huge amounts of money and running up the deficit until we get at least a flicker of rising inflation. This is why Fed Chair Jay Powell is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/30/finance-202-federal-reserve-chairman-tells-congress-keep-spending-rescue-economy/">practically begging Congress to spend more money.</a></p>
<p>We need to spend lots of money. We need to run big deficits. It&#8217;s the only way to save the economy, and we shouldn&#8217;t even think about slowing down until inflationary pressures start to seriously rise. That&#8217;s probably at least a year away, maybe more.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><em><strong>Posted Thursday evening, August 20, 2020.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Biden Harris Kamala Harris after her inauguration as SF DA personal photo - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8b8dc9200c-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Biden Harris Kamala Harris after her inauguration as SF DA personal photo - Edited" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="color: #737373;">U.S. Senator and Democratic nominee for Vice-President Kamala Harris back on her first day as San Francisco’s District Attorney. She had just been inaugurated and had come into her office to get a feel for it---and to get to work. Personal photo courtesy of Kamala Harris, via the Bemidji Pioneer.</span></h5>
<p>In the video short introducing her at the convention last night, someone close to Kamala Harris described her as “fierce”. I didn’t catch who it was. Her sister? Her best friend? No matter. Someone who knew her growing up. When I heard the word “fierce” I jumped up from my chair. “Yes!” I cried to myself. Fierce is one of the words I’ve been using to describe her on the blog, on Twitter, in analog conversations, from the start. Her ferocity is one of things that drew me to her when she first came to the Senate in 2017 and I saw her at work in Judiciary Committee hearings and then helped make her my first choice for the presidential nomination. It’s what made her my favorite for the VP nod. I think Biden needs her ferocity. He needs her to be fierce on his behalf. And what I like most about her ferocity is how calm she is when she is at her fiercest.</p>
<p>At any rate, in this anecdote from her memoir <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Truths We Hold”</a> she tells a story from when she was a law student interning in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office in California. She describes herself getting what she needed to get done by begging and pleading with the court clerk. But I imagine what moved the clerk to action was that she sensed the ferocity beneath the begging and pleading and knew to get out of the way...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As summer interns, we understandably had very little power or influence. Our job was primarily to learn and observe, while assisting where we could. It was a chance to get a taste of how the criminal justice system worked from the inside, what looked like when justice was served---and when it wasn’t. We were placed with attorneys who were trying all kinds of cases, from DUIs to homicides, and had the chance to be in a room---and part of the process---of putting together a case.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget the time my supervisor was working on a case involving a drug bust. The police had arrested a number of individuals in the raid, including an innocent bystander: a woman who had been at the wrong place at the wrong time and had been swept up in the dragnet. I hadn’t seen her. I didn’t know who she was or what she looked like. I didn’t have any connection to her except the report I was reviewing. But there was something about her that caught my attention.</p>
<p>It was late on a Friday afternoon, and most people had gone home for the weekend. In all likelihood, a judge wouldn’t see her until Monday. That meant she’d have to spend the weekend in jail.</p>
<p><em>Does she work weekends? Is she going to have to explain to her employer where she was? Is she going to get fired?</em></p>
<p>Even more important, I knew she had young children at home. <em>Do they know she’s in jail? They must think she did something wrong. Who’s taking care of them right now? Is there even someone who can? Child Protection might get called. My God, she could lose her kids.</em></p>
<p>Everything was on the line for this woman: her family, her livelihood, her standing in the community, her dignity, her liberty. And yet she’d done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>I rushed to the clerk of the court and asked to have the case called that very day. I begged. I pleaded. If the judge could just return to the bench for five minutes, we could get her released. All I could think about washer family and her frightened children. Finally, as the minutes in the day wound down, the judge returned. I watched and listened as he reviewed her case, waiting for him to give the order. Then with the pound of the gavel, just like that, she was free. She’d get to go home to her children in time for dinner…</p>
<p>It was a defining moment in my life. It was the crystallization of how, even on the margins of the criminal justice system, the stakes were extraordinarily high and intensely human. It was a realization that, even with the limited authority of an intern, people who cared could do justice. It was revelatory, a moment that proved it mattered to have compassionate people working as prosecutors. Years before I would be elected to run a major prosecutor’s office, this was one of the victories that mattered most. I knew she was going home.</p>
<p>And I knew the kind of work I wanted to do and who I wanted to serve.</p>
