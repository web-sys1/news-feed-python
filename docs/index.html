    <p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/lunar_module.jpg" width="100%" alt="Lunar module and lunar rover, photo via NASA" class="size-medium" /></p>
<p>This post will illustrate two things: the amount of time astronauts have spent on the moon, and how to process dates and times in Python.</p>
<p>I was curious how long each Apollo mission spent on the lunar surface, so I looked up the timelines for each mission from NASA. Here&#8217;s the timeline for<a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm"> Apollo 11</a>, and you can find the timelines for the other missions by making the obvious change to the URL.</p>
<p>Here are the data on when each Apollo lunar module touched down and when it ascended.</p>
<pre>
    data = [
        ("Apollo 11", "1969-07-20 20:17:39", "1969-07-21 17:54:00"),
        ("Apollo 12", "1969-11-19 06:54:36", "1969-11-20 14:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 14", "1971-02-05 09:18:13", "1971-02-06 18:48:42"),
        ("Apollo 15", "1971-07-30 22:16:31", "1971-08-02 17:11:23"),
        ("Apollo 16", "1972-04-21 02:23:35", "1972-04-24 01:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 17", "1972-12-11 19:54:58", "1972-12-14 22:54:37"),
    ]
</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s a first pass at a program to parse the dates and times above and report their differences.</p>
<pre>
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def str_to_datetime(string):
        return datetime.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    def diff(str1, str2):
        return str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)

    for (mission, touchdown, liftoff) in data:
        print(f"{mission} {diff(liftoff, touchdown)}")
</pre>
<p>This works, but the formatting is unsatisfying.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21:36:21
    Apollo 12 1 day, 7:31:11
    Apollo 14 1 day, 9:30:29
    Apollo 15 2 days, 18:54:52
    Apollo 16 2 days, 23:02:12
    Apollo 17 3 days, 2:59:39
</pre>
<p>It would be easier to scan the output if it were all in hours. So we rewrite our <code>diff</code> function as follows.</p>
<pre>
    def diff(str1, str2):
        delta = str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)
        hours = delta.total_seconds() / 3600
        return round(hours, 2)
</pre>
<p>Now the output is easier to read.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21.61
    Apollo 12 31.52
    Apollo 14 33.51
    Apollo 15 66.91
    Apollo 16 71.04
    Apollo 17 74.99
</pre>
<p>These durations fall into three clusters, corresponding to the Apollo mission types G, H, and J.  Apollo 11 was the only G-type mission. Apollo 12, 13, and 14 were H-type, intended to demonstrate a precise landing and explore the lunar surface. (Apollo 13 had to loop around the moon without landing.) The J-type missions were more extensive scientific missions. These missions included a lunar rover (&#8220;moon buggy&#8221;) to let the astronauts travel further from the landing site. There were no I-type missions; the objectives of the original I-type missions were merged into the J-type missions.</p>
<p>One note about the Python code: subtracting dates works unlike you&#8217;d expect, depending on your expectations. The difference between an earlier date and a later date is positive. You might expect that when speaking of dates informally. But if you think of the difference in dates as subtracting the number of seconds from some epoch to a that date, you&#8217;d expect the opposite sign. </p>
<p>Incidentally, UNIX systems store times as seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00. That means the first two lunar landings were at negative times and the last four were at positive times. More on UNIX time <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/02/05/leap-seconds/">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="">In light <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/tech/tiktok-trump-bytedance-sale/index.html">of current events</a>, I’ve been paying more attention to TikTok lately. By “paying attention”, I mean I’ve been watching the nightly batch of puppy TikToks that my daughters have lovingly curated for me.</p><p class="">So from this perspective, I didn’t understand what the big deal was with TikTok and why folks are talking about banning it in the United States. It turns out the issue is much more complicated than puppy videos. If you’d like to get up to speed, Ben Thompson&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/"><span>summarizes and adds some insight.</span></a></p>

      Posted on 01 August 2020 at 7:25&thinsp;pm
      • Kevin Drum – Mother Jones
      
        • by Kevin Drum
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Katherine Eban has a longish piece in <em>Vanity Fair</em> about how the White House—and Jared Kushner in particular—handled the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, there&#8217;s a passage examining why Kushner and Trump <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air">showed little interest in a national plan:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: <strong>that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically.</strong> “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.</p>
<p>That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a scoop, though, since it was widely known among reporters at the time. Kushner, who was a sort of free-roving coronavirus troubleshooter in the early days, apparently started out trying to put together a national plan with his team of college pals and young banker types, but it never saw the light of day. By the end of April, partisan considerations had overwhelmed everything. Kushner and Trump decided that instead of putting in place a plan that would effectively crush the virus, they wanted a plan that would most effectively boost Trump&#8217;s reelection plans.</p>
<p><strong>OBLIGATORY NOTE:</strong> The White House, of course, denies all of this. Given their track record for lying about everything, however, there&#8217;s no need for you to take this seriously.</p>
<p>In any case, with Kushner in charge it&#8217;s not clear just how good a national plan would have been anyway. Kushner&#8217;s mysterious planeloads of pandemic supplies have been documented before, but Eban provides a case study of one particular Kushner brainstorm that illustrates how his &#8220;just get shit done&#8221; attitude played out in real life. The idea was to order millions of Chinese-made COVID-19 test kits from an outfit in the Middle East:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Normally, federal government purchases come with detailed contracts, replete with acronyms and identifying codes.</strong> They require sign-off from an authorized contract officer and are typically made public in a U.S. government procurement database, under a system intended as a hedge against waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>
<p><strong>This purchase did not appear in any government database. Nor was there any contract officer involved.</strong> Instead, it was documented in an invoice obtained by <em>Vanity Fair</em>, from a company, Cogna Technology Solutions (its own name misspelled as “Tecnology” on the bill), which noted a total order of 3.5 million tests for an amount owed of $52 million. The “client name” simply noted “WH.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be off base here, but the thing that really drew my attention was the invoice itself:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856616"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856616" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_cogna_invoice.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="1695"></figure>
<p>Does this even look like a real invoice? It&#8217;s not aligned right; it has misspelled words; there&#8217;s no customer information and no order reference; and just based on having seen lots of invoices in my time, it doesn&#8217;t look real. It looks like something that was whomped up in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all. The test kits were delivered in late March, but they were no good. &#8220;An FDA spokesperson told <em>Vanity Fair</em> the tests may have been rendered ineffective because of how they were stored when they were shipped from the Middle East. &#8216;The reagents should be kept cold,&#8217; the spokesperson said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reagents should be kept cold.&#8221; No kidding. A freshman chemistry major could have guessed that. But this kind of planning is what passes for brilliant thinking among the Kushnerites and the Trump administration in general. Ideology aside, it turns out that it really does matter if the president of the United States is competent.</p>

    <p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida
law enforcement placed a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida, under
arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the
biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history, one
that took over the accounts of President Barack Obama,
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon
Musk, Kanye West, Apple, and more to perpetrate a huge bitcoin
scam on July 15th.</p>

<p>But apparently, he wasn’t alone: shortly after the Tampa arrest
was revealed and after we published this story, two more
individuals were formally charged by the US Department of Justice:
22-year-old Nima Fazeli in Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard
in the UK. They go by the hacker aliases “Rolex” and “Chaewon,”
respectively, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>

<p>According to federal agents, Sheppard had used a personal driver’s
license to verify himself with the Binance and Coinbase
cryptocurrency exchanges, and his accounts were found to have sent
and received some of the scammed bitcoin. Fazeli also used a
driver’s license to verify with Coinbase, where accounts
controlled by “Rolex” allegedly received payments in exchange for
stolen Twitter usernames.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears Twitter wasn’t the victim of anything vaguely approaching an expert caper. These kids are <a href="https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1289396815003922435">such dingbats</a> they used Bitcoin accounts opened in their own names. This profoundly disturbing and dangerous hack was pulled off by unsophisticated pranksters.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder what actual expert hackers are getting away with on Twitter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app that has been under scrutiny
from the Trump administration, is in talks to sell itself to
Microsoft and other companies as President Trump prepares to force
TikTok to divorce itself from its parent company, ByteDance, said
people with knowledge of the discussions.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump, who said on Friday that he was considering “banning
TikTok,” is expected to require ByteDance to sever ties with the
popular app, according to a person familiar with the
administration’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
White House officials have said TikTok may pose a national

    <p>Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a
small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack.
A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to
both our internal network as well as specific employee
credentials that granted them access to our internal support
tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had
permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers
used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain
information about our processes. This knowledge then enabled them
to target additional employees who did have access to our account
support tools. Using the credentials of employees with access to
these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts,
ultimately Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and
downloading the Twitter Data of 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t find the level of detail here satisfying at all. I don’t expect Twitter to reveal the exact details of what happened, but this just isn’t enough. My guess is that they’re saying that the attackers targeted low-level employees via the phone, tricked them into revealing details, and used those details to (here’s where the guessing starts) impersonate them on Twitter’s internal Slack. Then, impersonating them on Slack, they tricked other employees into giving them access to these incredibly sensitive account management tools?</p>

<p>What seems clear is that internally, Twitter was inexcusably sloppy with sharing access to incredibly sensitive account management tools.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been spending more time at my mother&#8217;s house than at my own, which means I&#8217;m mostly taking pictures of her cats these days. This one is a picture of Stripey, who was rolling around on the driveway until she caught a glimpse of my camera and immediately became a cat of considerable purpose. And what is that purpose? To stick her nose into the lens and then take a few swats at it. She seems to think of the camera as a new playmate.</p>

    <p>You think <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/07/chart-of-the-day-gdp-plummets-in-q2/">we have it bad?</a> GDP plunged by 11.9 percent in Europe during the second quarter of the year. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856430"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1270px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856430" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_eu_gdp_q2_2020.gif" alt="" width="1270" height="622"></figure>
<p>There is, however, a bright side to this: Europe has mostly crushed COVID-19. They took their shutdown more seriously than we did, and they kept it in place for about a month longer. The result is an economic crash even worse than ours, but with prospects of a full recovery this year now that the virus is under control. By the end of the year we&#8217;ll know for sure whether the European or American strategy worked better in the long run.</p>

    <p>CNet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duke’s account “has been permanently suspended for Twitter Rules on hateful conduct,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. Twitter’s policy, revised in March, prohibits posts that promote violence or threats of violence against people based on their religion, race or ethnic origin.</p>

<p>It wasn’t immediately clear what specific post or posts by Duke led to the account’s ban. The verified account for Duke, the founder and former Grand Dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was blank Thursday, replaced with a message that the account had been “permanently suspended.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine going back in time 30 years and explaining to someone that in the future, there are privately-owned computer networks for socializing and sharing your thoughts, observations, and opinions, and that David Duke got kicked off the one that is most popular in news media circles.</p>

<p>“Ha, probably happened the first day,” your circa 1990 friend might say.</p>

<p>“No, actually, it took more than 10 years.”</p>

<p>“What? Does David Duke repent in the future? Does he disavow white supremacy?”</p>

<p>“No he doesn’t change at all.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any sense.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you find out who the president is. Sleep tight.”</p>

<a href="https://www.onitsukatiger.com/us/en-us/mexico-66/p/ANA_1183A730-100.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onitsuka Tigers (Mexico 66) Sneakers</a> ($85)<br />
My first one are the shoes I wear probably about 363 and a half days of the year, which are Onitsuka Tigers, Mexico 66. These sneakers have kind of an interesting history among the earliest dedicated athletic shoes designed and made in Japan. I was a cross country runner in high school, and we had these shoes that were lightweight and made just for running. You didn&#8217;t really wear them around. And there was something about them being purpose built, made for running. I also played sports, baseball and basketball, and there were shoes for those things, but these running shoes felt a little more exotic, maybe because running wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. And so I wore them very excitedly back then, even though I hated running and still hate running. Then over the years, as I got older, I came across this literature on barefoot exercise and that led down a rabbit hole and another rabbit hole. And I realized I wasn&#8217;t going to go around barefoot because the world is too built up to really be barefoot. But I did want to go to some form of minimalism. And then I found out that these Onitsuka Tigers had been resurrected, I think in the early 2000s. And now they&#8217;re kind of a style sneaker. I love them because they&#8217;re essentially, a ballet flat that you can wear every day. They&#8217;re incredibly lightweight and I&#8217;d come to believe, through an episode we did a Freakonomics Radio called, something like These Shoes are Killing Me, where we looked into the physiology of feet and how humans are meant to walk and run, that we aren&#8217;t meant to wear these big, built up shoes with all this cushioning. And in fact, there&#8217;s a good reason to think that where the more protection you wear, the more your body kind of atrophies and responds in the wrong ways. And so these are sneakers comfortable enough to barely know you&#8217;re wearing a shoe. They&#8217;re supportive enough to walk on anything, rocks, whatever. You can run and play golf and do anything in them. And they also come in enough styles and colors and so on that if you care about such things, which I tend to mostly not, you can have a beautiful pair that you can wear as the equivalent of a dress or work shoe. And so I think they are a really cool tool.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00F3GYMKU/cooltoolsshow-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anchovy paste</a> ($8)<br />
My second cool tool is, oh anchovy paste. This is not exotic or unknown, unless it is. I&#8217;m guessing that most people who cook know about anchovy paste, but everybody&#8217;s at different stages of learning. And when I learned to use anchovy paste in my cooking, I felt like it was the first cool tool of cooking I learned years ago. And now we keep it stocked in abundance. And basically if you don&#8217;t know anchovy paste, it is the paste of anchovies in a kind of toothpaste type tube. Anchovy paste is the nitro version of the umami that you need in whatever you need. For instance, if you want to make the best Brussels sprouts ever, you would chop your Brussels sprouts relatively small, and then you sauté maybe some shallots and or garlic, in your butter and or oil before the Brussels sprouts hit the pan. But it&#8217;s the anchovy paste that you put in while you&#8217;re sautéing there that will just bring it to the next level. Also works for all kinds of sauces and is just a really good thing to have around. Especially if you have someone in your family that does not eat fish and is scared of all things from the sea, but also likes flavorful things. You just have to hide it. And occasionally I&#8217;ll make a label for something else and call it like clown juice and put it on the anchovy paste canister, so that we fool everybody. There&#8217;s a brand called Amore, which happens to be Italian. I&#8217;m not sure their anchovies are any tastier than the others, but it&#8217;s really useful.</p>

<a href="https://www.puzzleyou.com/photo-puzzle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puzzleYOU</a> — jigsaw puzzle made from your own photo<br />
We don&#8217;t do jigsaw puzzles as a family the way we did when they were younger, but my wife still likes a jigsaw puzzle now and again, but she&#8217;d really put it aside for years and years, but during the pandemic, like a lot of people, she was looking for activities to do. I take that back. She started on this before COVID, for some reason. She just felt like doing some jigsaw puzzles. And so she had a few. And in fact, the reason I remember it was before is because my wife got very sick with COVID and so we quarantined her at home and it was tough. One of the first things she was able to do when she was starting to recover was to get down on the floor to do the jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle kind of became the symbol of her quarantine and to this day now, a few months later, she&#8217;s still doing jigsaw puzzles and we all pitch in now and again, but for Mother&#8217;s Day, my daughter, teenage daughter found a really nice gift idea, which was a custom made jigsaw puzzle made of a photo that you send in. It doesn&#8217;t shock me that it exists, but I was thrilled that it does exist. We selected a photo that we thought she would like a lot. It was a photo of my son and I playing this board game, an election board game. And our little dog had its paws up on the table over the game as if it was playing the board game. It&#8217;s one of those kind of vaguely comical anthropomorphizing dog photos. But it happened that this photo happened to have a lot of things in the background that really read like our family. There&#8217;s a portrait on the wall behind the scene that showed the four of us. And there was an old photograph of my wife&#8217;s dad in the army on on the sidewall. It was his photo that was composed of all these things that represented our family. And we turned that into a jigsaw puzzle and gave it to my wife, Ellen, for Mother&#8217;s Day. And when the box comes from this company, they have a message. We put something like, &#8220;Happy Mother&#8217;s Day, love you.&#8221; And it was one of the best gifts that&#8217;s ever happened.</p>

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Word</a><br />
You will mark me as a combination Luddite and well, that&#8217;s not the opposite of a Luddite, but something else really bad. My fourth cool tool and my most important by far is Microsoft Word. It is a computer program made by a company called Microsoft. And it is for making words, things like writing. Look, I recognize that I love Microsoft Word in part because I&#8217;ve been using it for a long time. I&#8217;m a writer. It&#8217;s what I do. I&#8217;ve written a lot of books. I&#8217;ve used Word on all of them, although I should also say I started writing before Microsoft Word existed. The first computer I wrote on was something called the IBM Display Writer which had a huge floppy disk drive. And there was one disc for composing and another disc for editing and another disc for spell checking and so on. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m wed to it because it was the only program I ever used. I used WordPerfect and I wrote on Commodores and I wrote on early Mac and so on, but I think Word is an amazing program because it does everything I would ever want it to do for any kind of writing. And I only use probably about a half a percent of it. And I got to know Nathan Myhrvold, a little bit, one of the former CTOs of Microsoft, who I believe was involved along with a lot of other people in creating this and had some conversations just about it. And I&#8217;m just constantly amazed at how well thought through it is. And I know some people get intimidated by it. I know some people think it&#8217;s overkill. I know some people think it&#8217;s not modern and beautiful enough, but I think it&#8217;s a tool that helps me do my best work writing. And I&#8217;m really, truly grateful for it.</p>

    <p>Consumer spending increased in June, but it&#8217;s still about $1 trillion below where it ought to be:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856367"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1266px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856367" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog_consumer_spending_june_2020.gif" alt="" width="1266" height="622"></figure>
<p>Even though national income increased thanks to stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits, people still aren&#8217;t willing to spend like they used to. Instead they&#8217;re saving more than normal, and who can blame them? If they had more confidence in both the federal response to COVID-19 and Republican willingness to continue benefits to the unemployed, spending might be closer to normal. But they don&#8217;t, so it&#8217;s not.</p>

As Deb Fallows and I saw in repeat visits and reported <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/03/craft-breweries-no-im-not-kidding-they-actually-matter-in-civic-development/476220/?utm_source=feed">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/04/paradise-duluth/477639/?utm_source=feed">here</a>, they had begun succeeding in that neighborhood-revival role—plus others, like being part of a <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1924981/why-duluth-best-town-america">Duluth’s emergence</a> as an outdoors and tourist destination, and helping <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/04/on-national-beer-day-craft-brewers-improving-water-and-life-in-more-ways-than-one/477429/?utm_source=feed">protect the waters</a> of deep, cold Lake Superior, on whose western tip Duluth sits.</p><p>Each time we’ve visited their part of town, we’ve seen a few more visitors, another restaurant or food truck, another little office or store. Meanwhile, Bent Paddle’s main business, as a taproom and brewery, continued to grow. Every time we talked, the four founders stressed that they’d grown mainly thanks to community supports (including advice from local business people and loans from local banks), so they felt an obligation to be part of the community’s long-term development.</p><figure><img alt="" height="459" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/original-15/410bc2770.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">The Bent Paddle team, in 2016. From left, Bryon Tonnis, Karen Tonnis, Laura Mullen, and Colin Mullen. (James Fallows / The Atlantic)</figcaption></figure><p>But what now? This spring, Bent Paddle’s own taproom was of course closed, as were the restaurants and bars through which it sold most of its output. Could a little business like this survive, and could its surrounding neighborhood? This week I spoke with Laura Mullen in Duluth to ask how Bent Paddle had fared.</p><p>“During March and April our business was down about 50 percent,” she said. “No events at our site,” which had been an ever-busier civic gathering center. (We once saw a <a href="https://mariezhuikov.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/a-funny-thing-happened-at-bent-paddle-taproom/">local-writer’s club</a> holding a meeting in a side room.) “No sales to bars or restaurants,” which were about half of its total volume. “Draft beer was not happening anywhere.” Bent Paddle had to buy back some of the kegs it had shipped to bars and restaurants. Other kegs, already in warehouses, went past their shelf life and could no longer be sold.</p><p>Fortunately from the brewers’ point of view, Minnesota classified liquor stores as some of the “essential” businesses that could stay open despite a general lockdown. “That made us ‘essential workers,’” Mullen said, “because we were supplying products to liquor stores.”</p><p>Among the customers they could still reach in Duluth and elsewhere, Bent Paddle saw the same pattern that Jim Koch, of Sam Adams, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2020/07/will-craft-brewing-survive/614488/?utm_source=feed">recently described</a> to me: People who would otherwise have gone out to a restaurant or bar were in many cases “trading up” to buy nicer food or drink to have at home, still for a lower overall cost. (A fascinating <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/rebalancing-the-covid-19-effect-on-alcohol-sales/">report in Nielsen.com</a> shows exactly how much at-home drinking would have to increase to offset the near-elimination of bar and restaurant revenues. Medical experts are <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/07/01/covid-19-pandemic-brings-new-concerns-about-excessive-drinking">on the alert</a> for evidence that <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/07/01/covid-19-pandemic-brings-new-concerns-about-excessive-drinking">increased home drinking</a> is creating medical or behavioral risks—beyond those of the pandemic itself.)</p><p>Laura Mullen said that she expected this year’s sales, overall, to be about 20 percent lower than last year’s. Of the company’s 44 staff members before the shutdowns, it laid off 10. All but one has now returned. The company received a PPP loan to help cover the salaries. For the moment, Minnesota has allowed bars and restaurants to reopen for distanced outside service, and at 50 percent previous capacity indoor.</p><p>What were the lessons of this company’s survival, so far? Laura Mullen suggested these:</p><ul><li><em>An immediate pivot:</em> “When the taproom closed, we could still do to-go beer,” she said. “The minute [the state order] hit, after we shut the taproom we created all these signs and online videos,” promoting the idea that Bent Paddle was still open and explaining how to buy very safely canned beer to take home.  </li>
</ul><figure><img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/BentPaddleBrewingCo_CovidPreparedness6/9b997c21a.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Instructions on buying beer, in the time of COVID (Courtesy of Bent Paddle Brewing Co.)</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Going all-in on masks and distancing:</em> None of the signs and videos that Bent Paddle put up were about resisting or working around the shutdown or distancing order. All were about how to work with the rules. On March 20, they posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=258626025142051">a three-minute Facebook video</a> in which Laura Mullen walked potential customers all through the stages of picking up beer safely from their brewery. “We get a few Yelp comments complaining about our procedures,” she told me. “But we got many more complimenting us and saying that our safety protocols were top-notch, and they could feel comfortable coming here.”</li>
</ul><figure><img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/BentPaddleBrewingCo_CovidPreparedness10/beefbd8f5.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Bent Paddle’s newly distanced outdoor seating (Courtesy of Bent Paddle Brewing Co.)</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Reliance on the local:</em> When I first met them, the four Bent Paddle founders told me how important local-bank support had been when they started the company. Laura Mullen said the same was true for surviving the current emergency. “A lot of people who had bigger-bank relationships had trouble getting their PPP loans,” she said. “We have a small local bank,” whose officers the company had worked with for years, “and we were able to get things arranged very quickly. We’ve heard that across the board, that people dealing with smaller banks are in better shape.”</li>
</ul><p></p><ul><li><em>Concern for the neighborhood:</em> Bend Paddle’s success has been an important part of the Lincoln Park area’s revitalization. Now people are still coming to pick up beer, but not staying to shop in the little boutiques and smaller businesses. Their margins are thinner, and their products are less recession-proof than beer. Mullen said that she was even more concerned about longer-term effects on the neighborhood than on her own company.</li>
</ul><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><b>Redlands, California:</b> More than a dozen years ago, when I was living in China, I visited my original hometown of Redlands several times (for family-illness <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/tiger-jim/?utm_source=feed">reasons</a>) <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/03/i-was-born-too-soon-part-9-482/7978/?utm_source=feed">and noted</a> the emergence of a craft-brew industry there. The pioneering local company was sited right at a small airport and was named, with an aviation theme, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/the-rise-of-hangar-24/274308/?utm_source=feed">Hangar 24</a>.</p><p>On recent visits to Redlands I’ve noted the emergence of a new company, called <a href="https://escapecraftbrewery.com/">Escape Craft Brewery</a>. It’s located in an unglamorous commercial complex not far from Interstate 10, but its vibe and style are of the tropical carefree getaway. “We designed the name <em>Escape</em> for that idea,” Melissa Fisher, who cofounded the brewery with her husband Josh six years ago, told me last week. “You can’t always get away. But you can always <em>escape</em>. You can sit outside, open a beer, and be someplace else for a few minutes.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="330" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/Escape/a8e0443f4.png" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of Escape Craft Brewery</figcaption></figure><p>Before opening the company, Josh Fisher was an avid home brewer, with a day job as a firefighter. Melissa worked as an aesthetician in a salon. They spent two years scouting the area for an appropriate site—with parking, brewing space and facilities, affordable rent, appropriate zoning, outdoor patio space for the usually warm Southern California weather, and so on.</p><p>They found it in a modest storefront close to the I-10 freeway, amid discount stores and carpet-cleaning shops. Based mainly on the quality of their products, Escape’s beers and ambience grew in popularity. It expanded into a next-door property and had 10,000 square feet of space, about half of it for a tasting-room and taproom, and half for a game room where, according to Melissa Fisher, they also had live music, private parties, “dog adoptions” and other civic events. This August they had been planning to open a second site in Redlands, with renovation of an an abandoned warehouse building much closer to downtown. They were also preparing for an expansion to the resort-coastal city of Laguna Niguel.</p><p>In March, most of their business went away, all at once. No taproom traffic, which had been almost 80 percent of their total revenue. No private events, no live music, no community gatherings—and on top of that, no sales to the bars and restaurants that had been carrying Escape’s beers. “A couple of places even asked if they could send their kegs back,” Melissa Fisher said. “Usually that’s illegal, but the rules were lifted this time”—and they were legally able to re-package some of the product as “beer to go.”</p><figure class="right"><img alt="" height="433" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/IMG_1576/4b5599b19.jpg" width="325"><figcaption class="caption">Melissa and Josh Fisher, inside the Escape tap room (Courtesy of Escape Craft Brewery)</figcaption></figure><p>How would they survive? “I think that if this had been in our first year or two, it would have been monumentally bad for us,” Melissa Fisher said. “We probably could not have made it.” But in Escape’s six years of operation, it had built a local following, and the Fishers had saved their profits to invest in their planned expansions (and instead are using them to cushion losses now).</p><p>Like Bent Paddle, Escape quickly shifted, mainly to take-out sales. Instead of draft beer poured into glasses in the tap rooms, they would sell beer in cans for customers to pick up. (Side note: a decade ago, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/02/it-appears-that-i-was-very-very-wrong-about-canned-beer/252970/?utm_source=feed">was surprised by</a> the shift among craft brewers from glass bottles to aluminum cans. Now the shift is all but complete. I can barely remember the last time I bought beer that came in a bottle.) It quickly put up a website for online orders of to-go beer and saw many of its longtime customers make that change.</p><p>This kept the doors open, but with an unpleasant real-world surprise. In the previous post I mentioned the all-important role of something most beer customers are barely aware of: the beer-wholesalers business. In the case of Escape, the challenging practicality was how hard and expensive it could be for a small operation like theirs to try to switch to canned-beer sales.</p><p>Start with the cans themselves. “A big brewer might pay 8 or 10 cents per can,” Fisher said. Because they’re buying in small volume, “We’re paying somewhere between 34 and 74 cents per can, and that’s before we put the label on it”—or the beer into it. “Then you run into the shortages because there’s a rush on everything”—of cans, of labels, of glass growler bottles, of aluminum “crowler” cans. Before the pandemic, state regulators had to pre-approve the labels for canned beer. Now they have waived some of the rules, and Fisher and her team have been filling in part of the label information with Sharpies.</p><p>At the taproom, a pint of beer might have sold for six or seven dollars, so a round of four pints would bring in more than $25. Those same four pints, as a take-out order, go for $10 or $12, of which three dollars or more would be just for the labels and cans.</p><p>So the Fishers are selling beer but at a tiny margin, which barely covers their costs. Before, with full service, they would typically have six or seven employees on a Friday night. Now, to manage take-out, they have one or two. (Several of the employees have voluntarily reduced their hours, so others can have them.) Escape has expanded outdoor seating, in the parking areas and loading dock outside their tap room. “We’re lucky to have that space,” Melissa Fisher said. “But when it’s 98 to 102 degrees—even when we have cooling machines, even with a beer—not everyone can handle being outside.” Like many other brewers and distillers, they’ve also been selling a line of hand sanitizer.</p><p>“What we’re making now, is keeping the lights on,” she said. “And we’ve had a huge amount of support from people who’ve become our friends.” Because of their savings, and adaptability, they expect to keep going, and ultimately to expand. But what they’re doing now isn’t sustainable, she said. “Something has to change.”</p><p>Something does. Stories like these deserve notice, in my view, because little businesses like Bent Paddle and Escape have played such an outsize role in bringing vitality and local-connectedness to so many American towns.</p><p>Coming next, two other stories, with other implications, from northern Florida and the Bay Area of California. And after the jump, reactions from two brewers.</p><p>In response to the item earlier this week, Jim Koch, of Boston Beer Company adds this point. He is discussing the recent change in Massachusetts beer-distributor laws, which his company support even though it will help all local beer companies <em>except</em> his:</p><blockquote>
<p>I realized there was one major thing I missed in our discussion that makes what happened in MA surprising in a business context.  That is the craft beer ethos that we are as much colleagues as competitors and that if we all act for the good of each other, we will all, in the long term, benefit even if there is short term sacrifice.  </p>

<p>I think that attitude, which often means sharing “trade secrets” and ideas and helping each other out with ingredients or equipment, has been an important part of our success and is rare in US business.  It also makes for a happier professional life if you can look at your competitors as colleagues and friends.  It is exemplified in the craft brewer practice that when you’re having beers with each other, each of you orders the other’s beer rather than your own.  </p>
</blockquote><p>And, a note from someone on the other end of the craft-brewing spectrum from Koch. This person writes from Florida, and from a small, newish company, but he shares Koch’s concern about arcane distribution laws. He writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>As a small craft brewer in Florida … we will survive due to the support of our community and our location. Some of my good friends in this industry may not make it. [One reason is …] beer distributors and their death grip on the craft beer industry - it’s important to our overall survival.</p>

<p>We have a very good relationship with our distributor. They are good people and our goals are aligned. But Florida franchise law, as it is, makes me pray these goals remain aligned because should they diverge, just like any Florida brewer - I will most certainly be on the losing side of any dispute. I’d like to see this inequity balanced for the good of the industry.”</p>

    <p>Notoriously secret as Apple is, there are but a limited number of ways to discover what exactly the company is developing. Thanks to our current ongoing pandemic, my surefire proprietary method—rooting through the compost bins, discarded smoothie containers, and perfectly round pizza boxes in Apple Park’s industrial trash compactors—has become impractical.</p>
<p>So I’m left instead with virtual trawling—which smells a lot better, at least. And there’s no better source for divining exactly what Apple is working on than the patent documents that it publicly files with a government agency. (I mean, we all tell the government exactly what we’re up to, no fibbing, right?)</p>
<p>I can see the skepticism in your eyes, so allow me to banish it to another plane of existence forthwith by running down three recent inventions that the company is—and I can’t stress this highly enough—<em>definitely</em> developing. You be the judge.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/31/liability-shield-congress-bailout/">This is good news, I suppose:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House is <strong>willing to cut a deal with Democrats that leaves out Senate Republican legislation aimed at protecting employers, hospitals and schools from coronavirus-related lawsuits,</strong> according to two people with knowledge of internal White House planning&#8230;.One of the people familiar with the administration’s thinking said the measure was “considered important but not absolutely essential.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mitch McConnell probably could have gotten his liability shield if he had been more reasonable. There&#8217;s a case to be made for some kind of modest &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; legislation, after all. But McConnell wouldn&#8217;t go there. Instead he insisted on a shield so strong it would have protected businesses even from the most egregious negligence. Even the Trump White House was able to see what a political loser this was.</p>

    <p>One of these quarters, Apple’s going to announce financial results that don’t result in some sort of record. Perhaps as soon as next quarter, even. But on Thursday, Apple announced the r<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569368/apple-shrugs-off-covid-19-with-record-quarter-boosted-by-sales-of-basically-everything.html">esults of its financial third quarter of 2020</a>—and they were an all-time third quarter record. Literally every measurable category went up, year over year. It was so sunny a set of results that Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed almost embarrassed to be reporting such huge growth amid a global pandemic and some powerful social upheaval in the United States.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s what I gleaned from the results and Apple’s regular post-results conference call with analysts that might provide some insight about where Apple is and where it might be going next.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569430/for-once-the-mac-and-ipad-lead-apples-record-financial-results.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

<p class="">I have never been a fan of screen protectors. Apple devices are beautiful. Screen protectors are not.

<h5><span style="color: #5b5b5b;"><strong>“Incenting” keeping workers in line:</strong> Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin speaking at a Cornonavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, April 2, 2020, while President Trump looks on, waiting for his turn to take over the microphone and begin another one of his lunatic stand-up routines. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-trump-unemployment-benefits-boost-higher-past-july-insurance-2020-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reuters file photo by Tom Brenner via Business Insider.</a></span></h5>
<p><em>[More July catch-up.]</em></p>
<p>The GOP is not the party of the working class. Not even of just the white working class. It’s not the party of workers at all. It’s the party of bosses. It’s the party of <em>putting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to work</em> on <em>their</em> terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an interview on CNBC, Mnuchin said he favors extending enhanced unemployment benefits beyond their scheduled July 31 expiration, but he said any extension must protect both employers and employees.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories of where companies are trying to get people back to work and they won’t come because the enhanced unemployment,” Mnuchin said. “But we’ll fix that and we’ll figure out an extension to it that works for companies and works for those people who will still be unemployed.”</p>
<p>Said Mnuchin: “We’re going to make sure that people are incented to go back to jobs.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard stories of people not wanting to come back to work because they’re naturally “incented” to not risk getting sick and dying in a pandemic that’s still out of control. But YMMV.</p>

<p><em>[More catching up on my July blogging even though it&#39;s August.]</em></p>
<p>DeVos’ mission is to destroy public schools and make college unaffordable for the poor and working and lower middle classes. It’s part and parcel with the Republican corporatist plan to create and control a class of desperate and optionless laborers who will take any job at whatever pay the owners chose to pay them and stay on the jobs without question or complaint because there’s nothing else out there but poverty. Only the already well-off are supposed to go to the better colleges and universities, can have educations that will carry them into the ruling elite. Only the upper middle class are allowed educations that will, with luck, keep them, anxiously, upper middle class. The others, disproportionately people of color, will attend poor schools, underfunded and overcrowded, without resources or adequate supplies and up to date textbooks, where they will learn at best to read, write, and do simple math, enough to make them employable, useful, usable.</p>
<p>Just got to thinking as I was reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made clear on Sunday she wants schools to reopen fully for most students for the 2020-21 academic year, even as coronavirus infection rates are soaring in some parts of the country and some superintendents say it is impossible for them to do that.</p>
<p>DeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN’s “State of the Union.” In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. “Kids need to be in school,” she said. “They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can’t — we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening.”</p>
<p>DeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy. In fact, DeVos last week threatened to withhold federal funding from districts that didn’t do what she wanted, even though she can’t unilaterally stop funding approved by Congress.</p>

    <p>Steven Calabresi, in a New York Times op-ed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have voted Republican in every presidential election since 1980,
including voting for Donald Trump in 2016. I wrote op-eds and a
law review article protesting what I believe was an
unconstitutional investigation by Robert Mueller. I also wrote an
op-ed opposing President Trump’s impeachment.</p>

<p>But I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet
seeking to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had
taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that
President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic
and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment
again by the House of Representatives and his removal from
office by the Senate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describing the Federalist Society as conservative and influential is like describing the ocean as large and salty. I truly never thought I’d be able to say I’m in complete agreement with Steven Calabresi, but here we are.</p>

    <p>Todd Haselton, CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple on Thursday announced in its fiscal third-quarter earnings
that the Board of Directors has approved a four-for-one stock
split. Since Apple stock currently trades above $380, it means
investors should expect to again have a chance to buy a share of
Apple for around $100, depending on where the stock trades at the
end of August.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/macjournals/status/1288946809549848578">Matt Deatherage notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve periodically reminded that Apple’s lowest stock price was 23
Dec 1997, when it closed at a currently-adjusted price of $0.40
per share.</p>

<p>After 31 Aug 2020 and the 4:1 split, the new adjusted record low
price on that date will be $0.10/share.</p>

<p>TEN CENTS PER SHARE.</p>

    <p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Apple’s quarterly call with analysts Thursday, Apple CFO Luca
Maestri made it official — the new iPhones won’t ship until
October this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unusual for Apple to say anything about future hardware, but they do like to set accurate expectations, and if they said nothing many would expect new iPhones in September.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2020 third
quarter ended June 27, 2020. The Company posted quarterly revenue
of $59.7 billion, an increase of 11 percent from the year-ago
quarter, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.58, up 18
percent. International sales accounted for 60 percent of the
quarter’s revenue.</p>

<p>A record third quarter — in the midst of a pandemic. Truly hard to believe even knowing that work-from-home has surely led to new hardware purchases.</p>

    <p>John Lewis, in an essay written shortly before his death July 17, to be published on the day of his funeral:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like so many young people today, I was searching for a way out,
or some might say a way in, and then I heard the voice of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio. He was talking about
the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are
all complicit when we tolerate injustice. He said it is not
enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us
has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out.
When you see something that is not right, you must say
something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It
is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build
what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world
society at peace with itself.</p>

<p>Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of
America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.
Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The
vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a
democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed.
You can lose it.</p>
