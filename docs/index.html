    <p>Liza Lin, Jing Yang, and Eva Xiao, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump’s remark over the weekend that he was weighing an
outright ban of TikTok in the U.S. sparked nationalist sentiments
in China, where the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid,
derided the situation as “the hunting and looting of TikTok by the
U.S. government in conjunction with U.S. high-tech companies.”</p>

<p>On Chinese social media, users likewise expressed outrage. Many on
the Twitter -like Weibo platform accused the Trump administration
of pandering to voters by stemming the rise of TikTok — and by
extension, China.</p>

<p>On Douyin, Bytedance’s domestic analogue to TikTok, where videos
commenting on a possible U.S. ban circulated widely, one popular
comment suggested Huawei be allowed to buy Apple Inc.’s China
operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Be allowed to buy” is some euphemism for a forced sale. But if China decides to retaliate — and why wouldn’t they? — what company might they target other than Apple? Facebook and Google are already banned in China. Amazon has AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">which has a fair-sized presence there</a>, but AWS is sort of the anti-TikTok in terms of being consumer-facing. Microsoft would be the obvious tit-for-tat target. But does Microsoft have a neatly bundled consumer presence in China?</p>

<p>If I were the dictator of China, and I was angry about the Trump administration forcing a proud Chinese company like ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok, and I was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-china-idUSKCN25002I">looking for a way to show that China cannot be pushed around</a> by the U.S., I’d look at iCloud and the App Store, and humiliating the biggest company in the world.</p>

<p>But AAPL shares are trading at an all-time high so I’m sure all is good and Apple has nothing to worry about with a rapidly escalating trade war with China and a cornered-rat deranged narcissist steering the U.S.</p>

    <p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A transaction of the type the president envisions could also prove
more expensive than the one Microsoft described on Sunday. Trump
said Monday that part of the amount paid to buy TikTok would have
to come to the U.S. Treasury Department because it would be making
the deal possible.</p>

<p>“It’s a little bit like the landlord/tenant; without a lease the
tenant has nothing, so they pay what’s called ‘key money,’ or they
pay something,” Trump said. “But the United States should be
reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money,
because without the United States they don’t have anything, at
least having to do with the 30%.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve never heard of “key money”? Me neither, before today. But Trump would know it because it’s a term from crooked New York real estate deals. <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2015/11/what_is_key_money">Here’s a 2015 story on “key money” by Virginia K. Smith for the New York real estate site Brick Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Key money is when you pay a landlord money (usually under the
table) to secure an apartment,” says renters rights attorney Sam
Himmelstein, who notes that sometimes, it was supers, building
managers, or even the tenants themselves who demanded the cash.
The practice, unsurprisingly, is illegal — only licensed real
estate brokers are allowed to collect commission for an apartment — and has largely fallen by the wayside in recent years. “I
haven’t seen it in years,” says Himmelstein, “and most people
don’t report it unless they get into a scrape with their
landlords.”</p>

<p>But why even agree to this kind of bribe in the first place?
Essentially, key money served as a payoff for a lease that held
particular value, like that of a rent-stabilized apartment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s how crooked this piece of shit Trump is — he just uses lingo that’s synonymous with illegal kickbacks <em>with no shame</em>.</p>

    <p>Current Affairs editor Nathan J. Robinson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. It costs
money to produce good writing, to run a website, to license
photographs. A <em>lot</em> of money, if you want quality. Asking people
for a fee to access content is therefore very reasonable. You
don’t expect to get a print subscription to the newspaper
<em>gratis</em>, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble
about having to pay for online content, because I run a magazine
and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.</p>

<p>But let us also notice something: the New York Times, the New
Yorker, the Washington Post, the New Republic, New York, Harper’s,
the New York Review of Books, the Financial Times, and the London
Times all have paywalls. Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Wire, the
Federalist, the Washington Examiner, InfoWars: free! You want
“<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/01/portland-protesters-burn-bibles-american-flags-in-the-streets/">Portland Protesters Burn Bibles, American Flags In The
Streets</a>,” “<a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/31/the-moral-case-against-mask-mandates-and-other-covid-restrictions/">The Moral Case Against Mask Mandates And Other
COVID Restrictions</a>,” or an article <a href="https://www.infowars.com/nih-admits-5g-can-actually-create-coronavirus-within-human-cells/">suggesting the National
Institutes of Health has admitted 5G phones cause coronavirus</a> — they’re yours. You want the detailed Times reports on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/europe/germany-nazi-infiltration.html">neo-Nazis infiltrating German institutions</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html">reasons

administration’s undercutting of the USPS’s effectiveness</a> — well, if you’ve clicked around the website a bit you’ll run
straight into the paywall. This doesn’t mean the paywall shouldn’t
be there. But it does mean that it costs time and money to access
a lot of true and important information, while a lot of bullshit
is completely free.</p>

    <p>Om Malik:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Why not someone like Disney which has dreams of being part of the
digital revolution? Disney has the audience. It has sprawling
global operations. It has the ability to walk the middle of the
road where it can appease the autocratic governments and make the
democratic countries satisfied. It also has a brand that has many
sub-brands that cross many demographic categories. Disney wanted
to buy Twitter. TikTok makes more of a strategic fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Comcast?</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Apple? It has money. It has the desire to blunt Facebook
and Google, even if it hasn’t said or done so explicitly! Or is it
because they are a bunch of hard asses when it comes to privacy
and may not play ball with the US government when it needs to
access data of some TikTok-er?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence my question, why Microsoft?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d be shocked if Apple got involved. Just isn’t their bag. But why is there no bidding war for TikTok? In addition to the baldfaced crookedness of Trump demanding and Microsoft offering a “key money” kickback to the U.S. Treasury, the other crooked angle in this claptrap saga is the fact that an acquisition of TikTok, partial or otherwise, is presented as an offer to Microsoft, not a company up for bid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I ask these questions but can’t help myself and not think about
the event of last week?</p>

<p>Why was Microsoft not part of the showdown between BigTech and
Washington DC? What makes them better than the other four? Why do
they get to be excused from on-air humiliation while others get
spanked for their monopolies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft’s absence from last week’s hearing was conspicuously odd then; <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/3/21353079/trump-tiktok-microsoft-antitrust-big-tech-china">now it’s glaring</a>. Especially when “buying upstart competitors” was one of the main thrusts of the whole thing.</p>

<p>If you’re a newish user — say from the last decade — this surely feels different than if you’re a long-time Mac user. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/">Bill Gates “rescuing” Apple with a $150 million investment from Microsoft</a> (the symbolism of which, along with the commitment to continue developing Office for Mac, was far more important than the money itself), Wired magazine (when Wired magazine was truly great) <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gocarlo/12568034114">running the “Pray” cover</a> (when Apple was truly at risk), <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/463947/today-in-apple-history-sun-microsystems-almost-buys-apple/">Sun Microsystems negotiating to acquire Apple for just under $4 billion in early 1996</a> (truly the nearest Apple ever came to death).</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of Apple’s stock, this is welcome news. If you’re a fan of Apple’s products, this is profoundly worrisome. How does a company this large, this successful, <em>not</em> succumb to hubris? How does Apple keep the edge of an upstart? I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’m just pointing out the obvious: the difficult part of Tim Cook’s era as CEO is really only beginning.</p>

    <p>MG Siegler, on Microsoft’s — strange, to say the least — <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/">blog post announcing its interest in TikTok</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just read the thing. It’s almost like a letter of fealty. It
reads like something a Chinese company might write under the
Chinese government. To that end, it reads as if it was written at
the <em>behest</em> of the government. Maybe that’s too strong. <em>Maybe</em>?
How about: “Hey Satya, great conversation today. It sure would be
nice if you could outline what we discussed publicly.” That kind
of thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the
President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject
to a complete security review and providing proper economic
benefits to the United States, including the United States
Treasury.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an actual paragraph in the post. The second paragraph, no
less. What on Earth?! Is Treasury getting a finder’s fee here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought Tim Cook’s participation in Ivanka Trump’s “just find something new” Zoom panel <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/15/find-something-new-my-ass">was a bad look</a>. This is something else.</p>

    <p>A new study says that dementia has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/alzheimers-dementia-rates.html">on the wane for multiple decades:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risk for a person to develop dementia over a lifetime is now <strong>13 percent lower than it was in 2010.</strong> Incidence rates at every age have steadily declined over the past quarter-century&#8230;.<strong>In 1995, a 75-year-old man had about a 25 percent chance of developing dementia in his remaining lifetime. Now that man’s chance declined to 18 percent,</strong> said Dr. Albert Hofman, chairman of the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the new paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.osu.edu/baby-boomers-show-concerning-decline-in-cognitive-functioning/">But wait:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a reversal of trends, <strong>American baby boomers scored lower on a test of cognitive functioning than did members of previous generations,</strong> according to a new nationwide study.</p>
<p>Findings showed that average cognition scores of adults aged 50 and older increased from generation to generation, beginning with the greatest generation (born 1890-1923) and peaking among war babies (born 1942-1947). Scores began to decline in the early baby boomers (born 1948-1953) and decreased further in the mid baby boomers (born 1954-1959).<br />
<strong>While the prevalence of dementia has declined recently in the United States, these results suggest those trends may reverse in the coming decades,</strong> according to study author Hui Zheng, professor of sociology at The Ohio State University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust the boomers to screw things up. On the other hand, this might be the result of juvenile lead poisoning, and <em>that&#8217;s</em> the fault of the Greatest Generation. Greatest indeed.</p>

<p>He began by emphasizing that while the Cube was powerful, it was air-cooled. (Jobs hated fans. Hated them.) He demonstrated how it didn&rsquo;t have a power switch, but could sense a wave of your hand to turn on the juice. He showed me how Apple had eliminated the tray that held CDs&mdash;with the Cube, you just hovered the disk over the slot and the machine inhaled it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Cube violated the wisdom of his product plan. It didn&rsquo;t have the power features of the high-end Power Mac, like slots or huge storage. And it was way more expensive than the low-end iMac, even before you spent for a necessary separate display required of Cube owners. Knowing I was risking his ire, I asked him: Just who was going to buy this?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But here is something else about Jobs and the Cube that speaks not of failure but why he was a successful leader. Once it was clear that his Cube was a brick, he was quick to cut his losses and move on.</p>

<p>I am the first to wonder whether it makes sense to write yet another part of this little saga, when Catalina is basically entering its last two months of active duty. But Catalina remains, I think, one of the most (if not the most) controversial Mac OS X releases, and now that I have finally had direct experience with it on a new machine I&rsquo;m using just for testing, I can confirm.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>When a couple of articles from this series on Catalina reached Hacker News in the past months, a lot of quips I got as response were from people who dismissed the problem altogether with remarks along the lines of <em>These nerds must always find something to complain/whine about. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Catalina</em>. Well, that&rsquo;s simply not the impression I&rsquo;ve had and continue to have. And not because I have 309 emails of negative feedback and horror stories to prove it, but because this volume of feedback itself is an indicator, in my private sphere, of a larger discussion that has been going on publicly (in online forums and specialised mailing lists) since Catalina was released last autumn.</p>

<p>I was hoping to skip directly to Big Sur, but I&rsquo;ll probably have to update to Catalina soon to use the latest Xcode.</p>

    <p>This is the third and last picture of highways fading into the distance from my Arizona trip earlier this year. But this isn&#8217;t really one single highway: it&#8217;s Baker Blvd. in the foreground and Interstate 15 in the distance. If I had backed up a few hundred feet you&#8217;d also be able to see the world&#8217;s largest thermometer, but alas, that would have put me on lower ground and spoiled the shot. All art is a series of compromises.</p>

This tweet was spurred by President Trump&#8217;s latest temporary appointment: Anthony Tata, a retired brigadier general with a history of anti-Islamic tweets. The Senate made clear that Tata was not going to be confirmed as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, so instead Trump simply appointed him as &#8220;the official Performing the Duties of&#8221; the DUDP. He could do this because the Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows him to. Trump has used the Vacancies Act to appoint dozens (hundreds?) of temporary officials without the bother of Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>This is an abuse of the intent of the Vacancies Act, but in the spirit of bipartisan benevolence I&#8217;ll offer up a simple compromise: tighten up the Vacancies Act and at the same time cut way back on the number of executive branch officials who require Senate confirmation. There are about 1,200 of them these days, and that sure seems like overkill. Does every deputy undersecretary really need a full-dress Senate confirmation, after all?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. Let Trump—and other presidents—appoint far more of their team than they do now, but for the positions that really matter get stricter about Senate confirmation. Given the intense partisanship of the Senate these days, this might also require placing some bounds on how long the Senate can keep a position from being filled, but that&#8217;s a subject for another days.</p>

  <p>Speaking at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said that TikTok
would shut down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another company

    <p>Seems like solid value for the price — $350 — but who’s going to buy it? I’m not saying people <em>shouldn’t</em> buy it, I’m saying they won’t because the people who should consider it are unlikely to know it exists. At this price, with this quality, the Pixel 4A seemingly deserves a major marketing campaign that I don’t think it’s going to get.</p>

<p>Cook’s whole statement is cogent, and though Bezos’s is clearly the most personal of the four statements, I think Cook wrote this or at least was very involved in the writing of it. This is how he sounds and thinks. His entire statement is worth reading, but I’ll just quote the portions I have comments on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is a uniquely American company whose success is only
possible in this country. Motivated by the mission to put things
into the world that enrich people’s lives, and believing deeply
that the way we do that is by making the <em>best</em> not the <em>most</em>,
Apple has produced many revolutionary products, not least of which
is the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “making the <em>best</em> not the <em>most</em>” line is true, and captures what made Apple <em>Apple</em>, and what Apple should continue to focus on as its North Star in all of its varying endeavors. The question, now that Apple has parlayed this formula into becoming the largest (by market cap) and most profitable company in the world, is whether Tim Cook truly still leads the company based on this axiom, or if he’s just saying it because “<em>we don’t have a majority market share of any product category, including phones</em>” is a pretty strong starting position for an antitrust hearing. They don’t sell the most things but they do make the most money, so it’s not like “most” doesn’t apply to Apple.</p>

<p>I think the answer is a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B. There’s a part of Cook that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/23/apple-ceo-tim-cook-has-spent-much-of-july-preparing-for-house-antitrust-hearing">clearly wants to argue that Apple shouldn’t even be here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do this, in part, by making ourselves and our customers a
promise — a promise that we will only build things that make us
proud. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs used to put it a little
differently: we only make things that we would recommend to our
family and friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rings fundamentally true but falls flattest in the areas where Apple is, or at least should be, getting the most antitrust scrutiny. Take for example the Netflix Rule — the “reader apps” exception that allows Netflix (to name the most conspicuous example) to offer an iOS app that does not use Apple’s in-app purchase system. To sign up for Netflix, a new customer has to do so at Netflix’s website. A lot of other apps — <a href="https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com/">many from very large companies, like Microsoft and Google</a> — take advantage of the same rule. The way the rule works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only certain categories of apps qualify. Apple calls them “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">reader apps</a>” but most of them don’t involve reading.</p></li>
<li><p>These apps offer paid services, but accept payment only on their own respective websites, not through the apps, cutting Apple out of the financial transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>These iOS apps are free to download, but when launched, are allowed to show only a way to sign <em>in</em>, not sign <em>up</em>. Not only do Apple’s rules forbid these apps from offering sign up within the app (which, in my opinion, is fine), or offering a tappable link to sign up on the web, but the apps are even forbidden from simply explaining in written words what you need to do to sign up. Apps using this rule can’t even say “To create a new account, visit our website” — <em>even if they don’t tell you the URL of the website</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">I wrote about this regarding Netflix in particular last year</a>, noting that Netflix does offer a telephone support number in the app. I called it, and a helpful customer service rep told me that to create a new account I needed to go to Netflix’s website and sign up there. They can’t just print those simple words in the app, but they can set up a phone number where they tell you what to do. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">As I wrote then</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, Apple can make the rules — it’s their platform. But it’s
just wrong that one of the rules is that apps aren’t allowed to
explain the rules to users. Apple should be earning its share of
in-app subscription revenue by competing on convenience, not
confusion and obfuscation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is <em>prima facie</em> wrong that one of the rules is that an app is not allowed to explain the rules.</p>

<p>Is Apple proud of this rule against explaining the rules, and do they enjoy explaining it to their friends and family?</p>

<p>Back to Cook’s opening statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like
Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful
smartphone businesses offering different approaches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google does not have a successful smartphone business, if by smartphone business Cook means selling smartphones. Google certainly derives many benefits from being the company behind Android, the operating system, and the Google Play ecosystem that is effectively a user-facing OS on top of Android, but that’s nothing at all like Samsung, LG, or Huawei.</p>

<p>And Huawei is an odd company to mention in the context of the U.S. market, where their phones and telecom equipment <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk">are banned because of national security concerns</a>. Worldwide, though, yeah, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/299128/global-market-share-held-by-huawei-smartphones/">Huawei sells a lot of phones</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we
do business. That is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any
product category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No M-word, but the meaning is clear: Apple has no monopoly so why are they here? Mind you, I’m not saying <em>I</em> think Apple doesn’t belong here — I think they do — I’m saying that’s what Cook is implying. No monopoly, no antitrust. And it’s undeniably true that antitrust laws, as written, don’t address a company that has attained a dominant position with only minority market share.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We created the App Store in 2008 as a feature of the iPhone.
Launching with a little more than 500 apps, it was our ambitious
attempt to drastically expand the features and customizability of
every user’s device. We wanted to create a safe and trusted place
for users to discover apps — and a means of providing a secure
and supportive way for developers to develop, test and distribute
apps to iPhone users globally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention here of Steve Jobs’s statement, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/app_store_moment_of_clarity">announcing the App Store in 2008</a>: “We don’t intend to make any money off the App Store. We’re basically giving all the money to the developers and the 30 percent that pays for running the store, that’ll be great.”</p>

<p>It would be interesting to ask Cook when Apple’s perspective on that changed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Curation has always been one of the App Store’s chief features and
sources of value for our users. We held a quality department store
as a model: a place where customers can find a great variety of
options, but can feel confident that the selection is
high-quality, reliable and current.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analogy to a “quality department store” holds as much water as a sieve. The App Store is analogous only to something like Amazon, an everything store, with apps ranging from premium products to abject junk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the App Store was created, the prevailing distribution
options available to software developers at the time did not
work well. Brick-and-mortar stores charged high fees and had
limited reach. Physical media like CDs had to be shipped and
were hard to update.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To omit the fact that there was — dating back to the mid-’90s, well over a decade before the iPhone App Store — a thriving market for software sold directly over a thing called “The Internet” is sophistry. Most Mac software is still sold and distributed this way <em>today</em>. If App Stores are so great why is most Mac software sold outside the Mac App Store?</p>

<p>Rob Pegoraro today wrote an entire piece for Forbes on just this point: “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robpegoraro/2020/07/29/what-tim-cook-left-out-of-his-version-of-app-store-history/">What Tim Cook Left Out of His Version of App Store History</a>”. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Brick-and-mortar software stores and middlemen distributors did charge exorbitant fees, and distributing software on physical media, no matter how it was sold, sucked. But talking about brick-and-mortar retail software sales in 2020 is like talking about when cars sucked because you had to crank their motors by hand to start them. Or even like talking about when our city streets were ankle deep in horseshit before cars existed.</p>

<p>Talking about brick-and-mortar software distribution without even mentioning direct downloads and sales over the web is flat-out dishonest, and clearly the most disappointing aspect of Cook’s prepared testimony.<sup id="fnr1-2020-07-29"><a href="#fn1-2020-07-29">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This same point came up in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/the_talk_show_wwdc_2020">my WWDC 2020 interview with Greg Joswiak and Craig Federighi</a>. Joz more or less made the same argument, talking about the App Store being the next step after brick-and-mortar, completely omitting direct web distribution and sales. Which, again, wasn’t just an intermediary step, but a market that thrives to this day. I let that slide without pressing back, and it’s my biggest (only?) regret of that interview. What I recall was being taken aback by the reference to brick-and-mortar — <em>how is that relevant?</em> — and completely missing Joz’s omission of the web as a distribution and sales platform. Trust me, no one regrets this flub more than me — especially now, as Apple continues to make the same specious argument.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-07-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Voting by mail has always been viewed as favorable to Republicans—or at worst a wash. Democrats embraced it this year because it makes sense in the middle of a pandemic, but Donald Trump simply refused to believe that anybody, let alone Democrats, could possibly be acting altruistically.

<p>That&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re so transactional and so cynical that you don&#8217;t believe non-selfish behavior is even possible.

    <p>After Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late ’90s, he famously simplified the company’s product line by drawing a four-product grid: consumer desktop (the bulbous, brightly colored G3 iMac), consumer laptop (then, just an empty space), professional desktop (the Power Mac, first the blue-and-white G3 and then the G4), and professional laptop (the PowerBook).</p>
<p><span id="more-12429"></span></p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There was no consumer laptop in Apple’s product line until the iBook was announced. PowerBooks were <em>expensive</em>. And as for that consumer desktop, the G3 iMac was a wild success<sup id="fnref-12429-imac"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-imac" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>, but for years the <em>real</em> Mac users looked down on it as a weird, underpowered toy that wasn’t suited for getting real work done<sup id="fnref-12429-work"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-work" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context, it’s easy to underestimate just how much importance the professional Mac tower had in the mind of the Mac world back in the day.  As defined by the standards of the 90s and early 2000s, these were <em>real</em> computers—boxes you could open up and swap hard drives, install RAM, stick in expansion cards, maybe even upgrade the processor itself. Time and trends and Apple’s own predilections have led us to a world, two decades later, where the only Mac that fits these criteria starts at $6,000, but back then the desktop tower was <em>the</em> Mac. The one that mattered.<sup id="fnref-12429-garbage"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-garbage" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Apple introduced an entirely new Mac tower, one that traded the cute colorful plastic of the Power Mac G3 and the more subdued gray and silver plastic of the Power Mac G4 for a more serious industrial design, clad in aluminum. In the early 2000s, colorful computers were for consumers and monochrome computers were for <em>serious</em> computer users.<sup id="fnref-12429-gray"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-gray" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/specs/powermac_g5_1.8.html">Power Mac G5</a> design represented the high-end Mac tower for a decade, keeping its distinctive look outside while adapting and changing on the inside. It survived the Intel transition. The G5 design, with a front panel punched so full of holes that it was 65 percent aluminum and 35 percent air, was so logical for a computer packed full of hot, high-powered components that after a six year hiatus, Apple brought back a Mac Pro that is deeply inspired by the design of the original. Like its predecessor, the 2019 Mac Pro also looks like nothing more than a giant box grater.</p>
<h2>An executive briefing</h2>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-cover-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5-cover" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Power Mac G5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwsn27J_tlo">was announced at WWDC in 2003</a> as “the world’s fastest personal computer.” Steve Jobs pointed out it was also the first 64-bit processor in a desktop computer, proudly trumpeting Apple’s partnership with IBM to create the G5 processor, which was replacing the Motorola-built PowerPC G4 at the top of Apple’s product line.</p>
<p>Apple was proud of the hardware design, so proud that I managed to score a hands-on briefing where I could walk through the design decisions with Apple execs for a cover story in Macworld. Macworld Expo in New York was coming up, so the only time we could meet was on the afternoon of July 3, the day before the long Independence Day weekend.</p>
<p>My wife and our one-year-old daughter and I were driving down to L.A. for the weekend, so we ended up stopping at Infinite Loop on the way south. A very nice Apple P.R. person (I wish I could remember who she was!) took them to the Company Store while I went into the executive briefing center. My daughter ended up with a new Apple onesie out of the deal.</p>
<p>The briefing was one for the books. Greg Jozwiak—who still frequently takes to the stage at Apple events—represented product marketing and Jon Rubinstein, Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering was there for the engineering side. For an hour, we stood around an opened-up G5 and walked through every little corner of that tower, as they told story after story about why particular design decisions had been made.</p>
<p>Today, that would be a podcast interview, and maybe a YouTube video. Back then, it generated three pages of photos showing both sides of the G5 motherboard, the inside of the case, and the front and back of the computer’s exterior, complete with quotes from both of them. It was an unusual way to do that story, right down to my insistence that we quote them at length and refer to them by their nicknames, Joz and Ruby.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-spread-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With 17 years of hindsight, the thing that sticks out the most about the G5’s design is just how obsessed it was about moving air around. Consider the two pro Macs that bracket this design: the previous tower, the final Power Mac G4, was nicknamed the “wind tunnel” because of its loud, aggressive fan noise. The 2013 Mac Pro, on the other hand, famously failed because it couldn’t keep its components cool enough, leading Apple into a “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">thermal corner</a>” from which it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The G5 was all about moving air around intelligently and quietly. In the WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs boasts about how it’s got nine fans, but you won’t hear them because they’re all individually computer controlled. If you took off the metal door on the outside of the G5, you’d be prompted by a clear plastic <em>second</em> door, this one there to keep the entire thermal container sealed. The power supply, processors, PCI cards, and storage bay were all separate air zones, moving from front to back.</p>
<p>Over the years, the airflow design on the inside changed as components changed, but the premise remained the same: Keep moving air through this thing so it can keep doing its job. It’s something the 2019 Mac Pro does, too. It’s a lesson learned from the Power Mac G5.</p>
<h2>Bunny suits and betrayal</h2>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/DSC01932-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Photo by Stephen Hackett.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t make Steve Jobs look like a fool. You will regret it.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/steve-jobs-ibm-2-6c.jpg">history between Jobs and IBM</a>, it’s quite a thing to consider just how much praise Jobs and Apple lavished on IBM during the launch of the Power Mac G5.</p>
<p>The truth is, when Jobs returned to Apple he found the company in a vulnerable position when it came to Mac processors. The PowerPC chip architecture used in every Mac was a constant sore spot. It’s not quite fair to say Macs were always slower than comparable PCs running Intel processors, but they frequently were—and even when they weren’t, they often lagged behind in sheer clock speed. Try explaining to someone that a 1.5GHz Motorola G4 processor is actually faster than a 1.7 GHz Intel processor—either they won’t believe you because one number is larger than the other, or their eyes will just glaze over in boredom. (It happened on stage at Macworld Expo New York once. True story.)</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote back in 2003:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Anyone who’s paid attention to the competitive world of desktop computers has noticed that as PC chip makers Intel and AMD have accelerated their chips to incredibly high clock speeds, the G4 has lagged behind. Lately, even Apple seemed to stop protesting that the gap was purely mathematical and not real.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple ended up hitching the future of Mac chip development to IBM, its other PowerPC alliance partner. IBM had been focusing on high-end workstation processors, and that seemed like a good fit for the Power Mac line, at least. Then Apple went to work doing its marketing thing, with that IBM relationship at the center. Steve Jobs held up a polished silicon wafer and showed photos of the IBM factory in Fishkill, New York, where the G5 was being made.</p>
<p>If anyone remembers Macworld Expo New York 2003, it’s as the last hurrah of the show in New York before it crept back to Boston to die. Jobs didn’t even appear, but there was still an Apple keynote (led by marketing head Phil Schiller) and a hefty Apple presence. I remember it differently, mostly because I was part of a group of journalists who took a field trip upstate to Fishkill to see the IBM factory. We put on white bunny suits and wandered through a series of clean rooms where robots created IBM’s cutting-edge processors, including the G5.</p>
<p>What a world! I’d written about Apple for a decade, only to suddenly find myself in an IBM factory. It wasn’t quite Microsoft HQ, but it still felt like being in the belly of the beast. But this was a new world. IBM and its chip-making prowess was now the savior of the Mac. A big, beautiful G5 future was ahead.</p>
<p>So, about that…</p>
<p>In hindsight, it’s clear that Steve Jobs placed a trust in IBM that it simply didn’t merit. I have to believe Jobs thought IBM could deliver 3GHz G5 chips within 12 months. (The G5’s fastest chip at launch was a dual 2GHz model—meanwhile, Intel was already selling 3GHz chips.) It was “a guarantee the likes of which Apple had never before offered,” as I wrote back then. Jobs seemed confident, IBM seemed confident, and they sold that confidence.</p>
<p>Apple shipped Macs with G5 processors for three years. There was <em>never</em> a 3GHz G5 chip. While there eventually was a G5 iMac, there was <em>never</em> a G5 laptop. The architecture wasn’t ever conducive to being used on mobile devices. Steve Jobs accepted an IBM projection, made a promise, hyped its relationship with IBM…and got burned.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened next: Apple revved up a secret project to ensure that Mac OS X could compile for Intel processors. Less than two years after members of the media frolicked in bunny suits in Fishkill, Apple announced that it was dumping the PowerPC entirely and moving to Intel.  A couple of years later, Apple finally reached 3GHz with a Mac tower and it was a Mac Pro powered by an Intel Xeon processor.</p>
<p>Also in the background, Apple had begun talking to other chip design companies about alternatives to the G5, desperately trying to find a new chip to power its laptops. One of those companies was P.A. Semi, which Apple ended up buying outright in 2008. P.A. Semi’s engineering team became Apple’s chipmaking team.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the ultimate lesson of the entire G5 affair: Steve Jobs, and through him Apple’s larger corporate culture, was reminded that if you are reliant on a partner for a crucial portion of your business, you can’t truly control that business. Making the G5 was a side hustle of a side hustle of a company in transformation—it just wasn’t that important to IBM, but it was vitally important for Apple.</p>
<p>Jobs and Apple learned their lesson. The acquisition of P.A. Semi led to the A series of processors that run the iPhone and iPad. They are widely considered to be superior to the processors used by Apple’s competition. And now Apple has picked up stakes once again and plans to make Macs powered by new versions of those processors.</p>
<p>You could argue that the Power Mac G5 has IBM’s failure inscribed in its very name. But I prefer to consider the aluminum cheese-grater design as a classic that bridged the gap between IBM and Intel. It was a design too good to throw away, and after a brief blip, it’s still with us today—albeit in a modernized form with more stainless steel and weirder holes.</p>

    <figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20macstitle.png?ssl=1" alt="20 Macs for 2020" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><p>I’ve been a professional observer of the Mac for three-quarters of its life. Sticking around that long—27 years—has given me a deeper perspective on its history. I remember the Mac before OS X, before the iMac, before PowerPC, even before System 7. We go way back.</p>
<p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks, I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them, counting down to number one.</p>
<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these are my favorite Macs—a bunch of them I only knew in passing and never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever—a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>
<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular, revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/">Baseball 100 project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable omissions.</p>
<p>To this, I can only say: My rankings may be terrible, and my omissions unforgivable, but they’re mine. Play along, make your own list, post it to the Internet, and see if everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Or as Posnanski put it, “The point of this for me is not the ranking but the stories.”</p>
<p>To take this walk down memory lane, I’ve read through many back issues of Macworld, MacUser, and MacWEEK, picked up a few books, and talked to some of my distinguished Mac journalism colleagues. I appreciate their contributions to the project.</p>
<p>Beyond the arguments about list-making, I hope the results of this project will expose some Mac history that deserves to be brought back into the light while entertaining along the way.</p>
<p>In addition to my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/20macs">weekly essays here at Six Colors</a>, there will be an <a href="https://relay.fm/20macs">accompanying podcast</a> at Relay FM, and a video series (made in collaboration with Stephen Hackett) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">the 512 Pixels YouTube channel</a>.</p>

    <p>One of the things that makes numerical computation interesting is that it often reverses the usual conceptual order of things, using advanced math to compute things that are introduced earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example I recently ran across [1]. The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/trig_hyperbolic.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \sinh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \cosh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \tanh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)} \\ \end{align*} " width="222" height="131" /></p>
<p>But it may be more efficient to compute the exponential function in terms of hyperbolic functions. Specifically,</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_via_sinh.svg" alt="\exp(x) = \sinh(x) + \sqrt{\sinh(x)^2 + 1}" width="262" height="22" /></p>
<p>Why would you want to compute the simple thing on the left in terms of the more complicated thing on the right? Because hyperbolic sine is an odd function. This means that half its power series coefficients are zero: an odd function only has odd powers in its power series.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to compute the exponential function in an environment where you only have a limited number of registers to store constants. You can get more accuracy out of the same number of registers by using them to store coefficients in the power series for hyperbolic sine than for exp.</p>
<p>If we store <em>n</em> coefficients for sinh, we can include powers of <em>x</em> up to 2<em>n</em> &#8211; 1. And since the coefficient of <em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> is zero, the error in our Taylor approximation is <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em>+1</sup>). See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/07/27/sine-approximation-for-small-x/">this post</a> for more on this trick.</p>
<p>If we stored <em>n</em> coefficients for exp, we could include powers of <em>x</em> up to <em>n</em>-1, and our error would be <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>).</p>
<p>To make things concrete, suppose <em>n</em> = 3 and <em>x</em> = 0.01. The error in the exp function would be on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>, but the error in the sinh function would be on the order of 10<sup>-14</sup>. That is, we could almost compute exp to single precision and sinh to almost double precision.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m glossing over a detail here. Would you really need to store, for example, the 1 coefficient in front of <em>x</em> in either series? For simplicity in the argument above I&#8217;ve implicitly said yes. Whether you&#8217;d actually need to store it depends on the details of your implementation.)</p>
<p>The error estimate above uses big-oh arguments. Let&#8217;s do an actual calculation to see what we get.</p>
<pre>    from math import exp, sinh, sqrt
    
    def exp_taylor(x):
        return 1 + x + 0.5*x**2
    
    def sinh_taylor(x):
        return x + x**3/6 + x**5/120
    
    def exp_via_sinh(x):
        s = sinh_taylor(x)
        return s + sqrt(s*s + 1)
    
    def print_error(approx, exact):
        print(f"Computed: {approx}")
        print(f"Exact:    {exact}")
        print(f"Error:    {approx - exact}")
    
    x = 0.01
    approx1 = exp_taylor(x)
    approx2 = exp_via_sinh(x)
    exact   = exp(x)
    
    print("Computing exp directly:\n")
    print_error(approx1, exact)
    
    print()
    
    print("Computing exp via sinh:\n")
    print_error(approx2, exact)
</pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre>    Computing exp directly:

    Computed: 1.0100500000000001
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    -1.6708416783473012e-07

    Computing exp via sinh:

    Computed: 1.0100501670841682
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    2.220446049250313e-16
</pre>
<p>Our errors are roughly what we expected from our big-oh arguments.</p>

    <p>If there’s a segment of Apple’s business that seems to fly in the face of the company’s philosophy—not just in terms of making a product that is substandard or lackluster—but in terms of actually being at odds with the way it otherwise does business, you couldn’t put forth a more prominent example than the App Store.</p>
<p>The discussion, always at a constant simmer in the Apple community, bubbled up once again last week even as Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled by lawmakers over antitrust concerns. Developers, regularly dissatisfied with the company’s lack of transparency and equality over rules, took the opportunity to renew criticism of not only that, but the hefty 30-percent cut of proceeds.</p>
<p>The App Store has been a profitable business for both developers and Apple in the decade-plus since its launch, but there’s a strong argument that as much of its benefits have accrued to those making the apps that feed it, just as much—if not more—has found its way into the coffers of the platform owner. Enough so that the company has built an entire fast-growing segment of its income around Services, amongst which the App Store is undoubtedly the crown jewel.</p>
<p>Apple’s impetus to keep on keeping on isn’t hard to understand. But, as the App Store embarks upon its second decade of operation, it may at least be worthwhile to investigate what changes could be made to improve it.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569278/time-for-apple-to-reevaluate-how-the-app-store-does-business.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1289710804338647040?s=20">@DongleBookPro</a> has today posted images of what seems to be a first-generation iPod Touch prototype with a 2013 Mac Pro-style glossy black finish.</p>
<p>  The Twitter user claims that the iPod Touch prototype pictured has &#8220;the same coating as the 2013 Mac Pro.&#8221; Had the finish been selected for the final product, it would have been the first metallic glossy black finish to be shipped on an Apple device.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the device:</p>

<p>I always liked that the iPod touch used the same chrome back as other iPods did back in the day, but this thing looks really cool.</p>

<p><strong>Classy free fonts</strong><br />
There are about 1,000 very classy fonts available for free on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. These are fonts you would actually want to use in your book or on your website. Some are commissioned by Google and designed by world-class typographers, such as the font Roboto used in Google maps. Many of these fonts come as families with different weights, italic, bold, extra glyphs, etc. This set of open fonts is also offered by Adobe and Monotype; what Google Fonts offer is a very nifty web interface for navigating through the collection, including good search and filter. I particularly like their font “pairing” function, which suggests good combinations of fonts (like text and captions pairings). All the fonts are license-free. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Craft in action</strong><br />
Everyone knows Anthony Bourdain’s various travel/food series, but in 2015 Bourdain did his hanging-out thing with master craftsman and craftswomen, going to their shops, watching them work with their tools, and at times trying his own hand at their craft. I can watch masters work all day. Their obsession with details is astounding, and their extreme excellence is captured in 14 episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdg0QhLNc29XuXmmv5Vu__bfNUeZI76ve&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Raw Craft</a>. The art ranges from hand-tailored suits to a traditional letter-press printer, all sponsored by a whiskey company, and available on YouTube. — KK</p>

<p><strong>Words of wisdom from GPT-2</strong><br />
GPT-2 is an application that produces novel text based on a text prompt (<a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/run-openais-new-gpt-2-text-generator-code-with-your-gpu/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Here’s how to install it</a>). Most of what it generates hovers on the border of sense and nonsense. Here are four pieces of advice it has given to me.  — MF</p>
<ul class="revue-ul">
<li>“If we cannot make sense of the present, we cannot plan for the future.”</li>
<li>“The more we change to meet the challenges in our lives, not to stay where we are, the more successful we will be.”</li>
<li>“If it is an animal you have seen, do you think it will be like you, too? This is the first statement of my doctrine, that all things are one thing. Do you want me to prove it, or to let it pass?” —Philosopher Epicurus (384-399 A.D.)</li>
<li>“Your gut tells you it’s not right to continue investing in some idea–it’s too risky, because its consequences are hard to understand. Your gut is right about one thing, though: there is no way of knowing it’s not wrong to spend your energy making the best decision for yourself and your goals.”</li>

<p><strong>Fun and powerful photo editing app</strong><br />
It’s incredibly fun to use the <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-award-winning-luminar-4-bundle?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Luminar</a> photo editing application to bring my photos to life. (Here are some of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWnNav04OUZsflczhGitdZEpOTdBcVHd?usp=sharing&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">before-and-after photos</a>.) It has tons of adjustable preset filters and a lot of specialized tools such as portrait enhancement, where you can make the subject’s eyes larger and face thinner. You can also easily add in new skies and even a sun with rays. I typically use the “AI” set of adjustment tools to change the brightness and contrast because it does a great job without a lot of fussing on my part. The developer also has lots of excellent videos that show you how to use all the features in Luminar. Here’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/390496469?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">30-second video overview</a>. — MF</p>

It’s extremely absorbent and dries super fast. When I’m done with it, I just fold it up and put it in a drawer. It’s also machine washable. I love it. — CD</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Last week, Dan Moren wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/automate-this-how-hot-does-it-feel/">a nice post</a> about calculating the heat index in Shortcuts. I’d written a similar shortcut a few days earlier to calculate the dewpoint (it must be a summer thing), but it was kind of crappy and I had put it aside. Inspired by Dan’s work, I returned to my dewpoint shortcut and cleaned it up.</p>
<p>While I’m sure the dewpoint is included in some weather apps, it isn’t in the stock Weather app. It is, in theory at least, part of the data set returned by the <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> action in Shortcuts. I say “in theory” because I’ve found that quite often the Dewpoint entry is empty when that action is run. Why that is I don’t know, but that was the reason my original dewpoint shortcut was disappointing.</p>
<p>The improved shortcut, which you can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8443b306698142e2b0da7fd412c11045">download</a>, uses a calculation when <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> falls short. Here it is:</p>

<p>The <code>Weather Conditions</code> magic variable is used repeatedly in the shortcut to get at certain data. For example, when we need the temperature, we add <code>Weather Conditions</code> and choose Temperature from the list of data.</p>
<p><img alt="Specific info from weather conditions" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Specific%20info%20from%20weather%20conditions.jpg" title="Specific info from weather conditions" width="50%"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the name of the type of data chosen is displayed in the shortcut. For certain data, like Temperature, we also get to choose the units.</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing the units" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Choosing%20the%20units.jpg" title="Choosing the units" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Here’s the JavaScript code from Step 6:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:
 1:  function dewpoint(t, rh) {
 2:    let A = 17.625;
 3:    let B = 243.04;
 4:    let part = Math.log(rh/100) + A*t/(B + t);
 5:    return B*part/(A - part);
 6:  }
 7:  
 8:  let rh = ☐ Weather Conditions (Humidity);  // number
 9:  let t = '☐ Weather Conditions (Temperature)'; // string
10:  t = t.match(/[-\d.]+/);
11:  t = parseFloat(t);
12:  
13:  return dewpoint(t, rh)*9/5 + 32;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dewpoint</code> function is based on this equation:</p>

\[T_d = \frac{ B \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)   + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right]}{A - \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)  + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right] }\]

<p>This is a curve fit, where \(T\) is the normal (dry bulb) temperature in Celsius, \(RH\) is the relative humidity in percent, and \(T_d\) is the dewpoint in Celsius. The parameters that give a good fit are \(A = 17.625\) and \(B = 243.04\). I got the formula from <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225">this nice survey paper</a> by Mark Lawrence. Unfortunately, the paper has a typo in the value for \(A\), and I had to look up <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035&lt;0601:IMFAOS&gt;2.0.CO;2">the original paper</a> by Oleg Alduchov and Robert Eskridge to get the correct value. Scholarship!</p>
<p>One of the great things about doing inline Scriptable is that you can stick Shortcuts variables directly into your JavaScript. That’s what’s happening with those weird-looking parts of Lines 8 and 9. Within the Scriptable step itself, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Shortcuts%20variables%20in%20Scriptable.jpg" title="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" width="50%"/></p>
<p>While the humidity is given as a number, the temperature is given as a string with “°C” at the end. Lines 10–11 extract the numeric part from the string<sup id="fnref:regex"><a href="#fn:regex" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and convert it from a string to a floating point number.</p>
<p>Finally, Line 13 converts the dewpoint temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Any complaints about this will be ignored.</p>
<p>Running Dewpoint directly from Shortcuts returns the output in this form:</p>
<p><img alt="Direct Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Direct%20Dewpoint%20output.png" title="Direct Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Running it in the Shortcuts widget on my phone returns the output within the widget:</p>
<p><img alt="Widget Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Widget%20Dewpoint%20output.jpg" title="Widget Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>This output is fine as written but not so good when spoken by Siri. There’s no pause between the temperature and the dewpoint. If experience shows that I’ll be using it mostly through Siri, I’ll change the Text definitions to be more like sentences.</p>

      • James Fallows | The Atlantic
      
        • by James Fallows
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve frequently mentioned my friend Michael Jones, a computer scientist and geography whiz. Nine years ago, he was a leading figure in my <em>Atlantic</em> story “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?utm_source=feed">Hacked</a>,” the saga of what my wife Deb and I learned when her email account was taken over by international hackers. For an <em>Atlantic</em> column around the same time, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/googles-michael-jones-on-how-maps-became-personal/266781/?utm_source=feed">interviewed him</a> on the way omnipresent, always-available mapping was likely to change people’s habits and lives. And before any of this, he had added to world knowledge with his explanation of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">Boiled Frog</a>” science. As he laid out in this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/07/guest-post-wisdom-on-frogs/21789/?utm_source=feed">guest post</a>, careful experiments in 19th-century Germany established that a frog would indeed sit still in a pot of ever-hotter water—but only if its brain had already been removed.  </p><p>Outside our household, Michael Jones is known, among other things, as one of the guiding forces behind Google Earth and Google Maps. When you see your neighborhood, or your planet, from above on a computer, or follow turn-by-turn directions on your phone, he is one of the people you have to thank.</p><p>Among the bright sides in the current pandemic nightmare is the news that this spring Michael <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">received the “Patron’s Medal”</a> from the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/">Royal Geographical Society</a>, in London. I am by nature wary of anything involving the concept of “Royal” (for reasons <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/?utm_source=feed">laid out long ago here</a>), but I make an exception in this case. I am delighted to learn of this overdue recognition for Michael Jones.</p><p>As the Society’s announcement put it:</p><blockquote>
<p>The 2020 Patron’s Medal has been awarded to Michael Jones for his contribution to the development of geospatial information.</p>

<p>Baroness Chalker said: “Michael Jones is a role model for future generations of geographers. From his beginnings as a software engineer, inventing and filing his own patents, through to his role as Google’s Chief Technology Advocate, his inspiring career trajectory is charted by his vision to redefine mapping from static lines and symbols to an interactive geographical web of context and information. It’s hard to overstate the importance that Google Earth and Google Maps has had on the public worldwide and how Michael’s pioneering work has democratised and popularised cartography and spatial awareness. Today we recognise his extraordinary contribution and his continued advocacy for the benefits of geography. He whole heartedly deserves the Society’s highest recognition.”</p>

<p>Michael Jones said: “This recognition is a signal honour for an idea that started in my head and which, through the work of many, resulted in the Google Earth used by billions of people around the world. On behalf of colleagues who laboured to make this dream of Earth and Maps a reality, and in full credit to the inspiring attainments of all who have come before us in the quest to better understand the Earth, I can only say that the ‘Earth-in-your-hand’ idea has never had a greater friend than the Royal Geographical Society, to whom we humbly offer our gratitude.”</p>
</blockquote><p>As a fellow Yank, I will razz Michael for writing “signal honour”—but it couldn’t be more deserved, with the British <em>u</em> or without. Congratulations.
