    <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8">Ben Gilbert, reporting yesterday for Business Insider</a> (italic emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This September, Microsoft plans to launch a major coup in the
video game business: The world’s first game streaming service with
a built-in library, Netflix-style. For $15 a month, you’ll be able
to stream over 100 games to smartphones and tablets — but it
won’t be available on Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><em>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because
Apple isn’t able to review each game that’s available through
Game Pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness">controversy over Basecamp’s Hey app</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Tim Cook being called to testify at an antitrust Congressional hearing</a> regarding App Store policies, and given the high profile of Xbox Game Pass, it’s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200806/p45#a200806p45">has gotten a lot of attention</a>, almost all of it focused on taking the italicized paragraph from Business Insider at its word. But that’s Ben Gilbert’s interpretation, not a quote from Apple. Gilbert’s interpretation is not an unfair or sensationalized take on Apple’s statement, but it’s adding a “because” that Apple did not state.</p>

<p>Here is Apple’s statement to Business Insider, apparently in its entirety. Apple seemingly sent this statement <em>only</em> to Business Insider, which itself is a bit unusual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for
customers to discover and download apps, and a great business
opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all
apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are
intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing
field to developers.</p>

<p>Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of
developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App
Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users
over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running this statement through my Applespeak-to-English decoder ring, what I hear is not that they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game separately. What I hear is that game streaming services are not allowed in the iOS App Store. Period, full stop. I don’t even think this has anything to do with whether Microsoft offers in-app subscriptions, or whether those subscriptions get a discount from the standard 70/30 split for the first year. I think Apple’s stance is that game streaming services like Microsoft’s xCloud project are simply verboten.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-07">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2.7">App Store guideline 4.2.7</a>, “Remote Desktop Clients”, seemingly makes this clear, too — it’s a written rule, not an unwritten one. This rule is why <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about">Steam Link</a> is in the App Store and Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia are not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is
    a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the
    user, and both the host device and client must be connected on
    a local and LAN-based network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like this: Business Insider asked Apple why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass. Apple didn’t say why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass, and instead gave a non-answer answer by describing what they do allow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submitting games individually and appearing in charts and search — presumably App Store charts and search — is just an obfuscated way of saying that native iOS game apps are allowed in the iOS App Store. Well, duh. Everyone is distracted by the interpretation that Apple won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game. It is a nonsensical justification, no doubt about that. But the comparison to Netflix or Spotify is beside the point. Of course Apple doesn’t and can’t review every movie on Netflix or every song on Spotify. But if you think about it, they <em>could</em> review every game on Xbox Game Pass. Even if it’s 100 games, they could look at them all. I’m sure they could find quite a few volunteers among the App Store reviewer corps to spend the time to play these games thoroughly.</p>

<p>The point is that streaming video and music services are allowed in the App Store; streaming software (games or otherwise) is not, unless it works over the web. <em>Apple just doesn’t want to say that.</em> Here, in my opinion, is how this conversation is best decoded:</p>

<p><strong>Business Insider</strong>: <em>Why are game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass not allowed in the App Store?</em></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong>: <em>Native iPhone games are allowed in the App Store. Native iPhone games are good because we review them individually, and they appear in App Store charts and search results.</em></p>

<p>It’s a perfect example of the difference between bullshit and a lie. Every word in Apple’s statement is true, but not a word of it answers why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass or any other cloud game streaming service.</p>

<p>Apple would have been much better off saying nothing at all than offering this bullshit non-answer answer, that in fact was so easily and reasonably misconstrued. And, purely as a guess on my part, I think Apple realized this, which is why they didn’t send this statement to any other outlet and haven’t added a word of clarification since.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just about the money, or even partially about the money<sup id="fnr2-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn2-2020-08-07">2</a></sup> — which certainly wouldn’t be shocking — but we don’t know, because Apple didn’t say, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/">neither did Microsoft in its own testily worded statement</a>, which, unlike Apple’s statement, was distributed to numerous news outlets.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2020-08-07">
<p>I really hope it’s <em>not</em> about the money. I mean let’s face it, no matter what the story is here, it’s sad in some way. Microsoft has made something technically impressive and cool and fun, and millions of Xbox-playing iOS users would love to play these games on their iPhones and iPads and but they can’t because of some sort of business or strategic shit that’s between Apple and Microsoft. But if it’s really just a dispute about goddamn money — between, of all companies, two of the richest in the history of the world — man, that’s just tawdry. It’s just two <em>corporations</em> fighting over one more stream of money neither even knows what to do with atop the Scrooge McDuckian mountains of cash they each already have flooding into their coffers each day. That’s business, but that’s a stale saltine of a story.</p>

<p>But what if it’s <em>not</em> Apple being a dick about money? What if it’s Apple being a dick about control?</p>

<p>That’s not cold and dry — that’s a goddamn sizzling hot juicy steak of a story. That’s <em>personal</em>. For one thing it would explain the pissy, petulant tone of Microsoft’s statement. Maybe Microsoft went into this whole endeavor gearing up for a knockdown drag-out knife-fight negotiation about how exactly to split the money, and Apple just went stone cold <a href="https://youtu.be/wPmTp9up26w?t=87">Michael Corleone on them</a>: “<em>You can have our answer now, if you like. Our offer is this: nothing. Not even the 30 percent fee for the gaming subscription, which we would appreciate if you put up your ass.</em>” The idea being, in this scenario, that Apple has something Microsoft needs, Microsoft has nothing to offer in return that Apple wants, and so Microsoft just has to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZhj7rPPzxg">sit there grooving on it</a>, stuck with a premium paid subscription service that’s only available on the low-rent mobile platform <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">where people don’t pay for things</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is clearly being a dick to Microsoft about <em>something</em> here, and if it’s platform control not money, well by god at least there’s some delicious poetic justice at play. That’d be a veritable vintage bottle of wine being uncorked. Not having any control over the world’s most lucrative computing platform and wanting something from the company that does — and which has a real taste for exerting its dictatorial control over said platform in mercurial fashion — would fucking suck, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

    <p>I wound up looking into the etymology of “cherry-pick” while writing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/07/instagram-hashtag-bug">this post</a> earlier today, and I’m simply astounded by this note from Merriam-Webster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first known use of <em>cherry-pick</em> was in 1965.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m shocked that <em>cherry-pick</em> is so recent. I figured it was not just old but maybe <em>really</em> old, centuries old. Is this right?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> The Online Etymology Dictionary <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/cherry-pick">pegs <em>cherry-pick</em>’s origin as 1959</a> — a little earlier, but not much.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Anu Garg, founder and writer of the excellent Wordsmith and its A.Word.A.Day newsletter, <a href="https://wordsmith.org/words/cherry-pick.html">pegged <em>cherry-pick</em>’s earliest documented use as 1966</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> The other OED <a href="https://twitter.com/howe/status/1291910907090448384">has an instance of “cherry-picker” as a railroad industry term for a switchman from 1940</a>, which usage explains why the idiom is about cherries — the switch lights were red.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>A year ago, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/?utm_source=feed">published a piece</a> in the print magazine about that long-standing object of American fascination, the Roman Empire. Usually, and usefully, Americans have over the centuries looked to Rome for guidance on how their nation could avoid the predictable slide from republic to empire to conquest and dissolution. My favorite in this genre is the wonderful 2007 book <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/are-we-rome-cullen-murphy/1111827041"><em>Are We Rome?</em></a>, by my friend (and <em>Atlantic</em> colleague) Cullen Murphy.</p><p>But for last year’s piece I discussed some other books, arguing that what happened to Rome <em>after</em> the fall of the Western empire is what Americans should be studying. Especially in this era when central government—leadership on the imperial scale, you might say—was faltering, and when our counterparts to the Roman provinces (that is, our cities and states and regions) were by comparison so much more practical-minded and functional.</p><p>My friend <a href="http://www.ericschnurer.com/">Eric Schnurer</a>, who has worked in and written extensively (including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/eric-schnurer/?utm_source=feed">for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>) about governance at all levels, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote a response</a> that highlighted some additional areas of useful comparison between the America of our time and the Rome of yesteryear. Now he is back with an extension of his argument. He calls this dispatch “From Sulla to Sullen: What the Fall of the Roman Republic Tells Us About Where Trump Is Taking Us.” I think it is instructive and worth reading, and with his permission I quote it below.</p><p>Schnurer began by directing attention away from the end of the empire, and instead to:</p><blockquote>
<p>… the approaching decline of the Roman Republic, a half-millennium earlier.  As I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/?utm_source=feed">wrote last year</a>, “the increasing economic inequality, the increasing political polarization, the total eclipse of ‘the greater good’ by what we’d call ‘special interests,’ the turn toward political violence” all  looked “a lot like the present moment to me.” I was thinking of the period dominated by the attempted reforms of the Gracchi brothers—a tag-team somewhat analogous to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren —roughly a century before the Republic’s ultimate fall into dictatorship.</p>

<p>I hardly expected then that within about <em>half a year</em>, Donald Trump would manage to fast-forward the country through <em>half a</em> <em>century</em> of Roman history, to the doorstep of the Civil Wars that destroyed what little was left of Republican Rome.</p>

<p>Of course, no historical analogy is exact. The collapse of the Republic was brought on by a combination of structural flaws in its politics and governance, and the self-serving ambitions of ruthless individuals that exploited them. While the causes were many, inter-related, and complex, at their root was a system that defied any notion of the common good and was devoid of political means to resolve rather than exacerbate division.</p>

<p>The Republic was the creation of a tight-knit oligarchy that had overthrown the preceding monarchy and, as a result, held a deep-seated determination never again to allow any one individual to accumulate so much power as to overawe all others.  </p>

<p>The solution was not so much a separation of powers, as we conceive of it—officials simultaneously played executive, legislative and even judicial roles—as a vast multiplicity of individuals who could hold their posts only once, and for only a year. But this was no “citizen’s republic”:  A small coterie of privileged families held almost all these offices and voting was severely limited.</p>

<p>Moreover, the term “republic”—from the Latin for “a thing of the public”—was meant to distinguished it from a monarchy, which was essentially the personal property of the ruler in which other people simply happened to live. But the Roman Republic was more like what we might think of as a “publicly-held corporation” and, essentially, treated as private property. Officials used public office to profit personally and directly (and openly).</p>

<p>Of course, it takes money to make money, so only the very wealthy could afford to pursue these rewards because, along the way, they were expected personally to pay for the lavish spectacles, such as the famous gladiatorial games, that sated the public, as well as major public works and public building projects. The Roman state, in short, while ostensibly “public,” had long since been thoroughly privatized.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This state was essentially an increasingly-imperial business enterprise, in the guise of a government. The expanding conquests, which were basically run as profit centers, undercut the working populations in the city through a growing influx of slave labor, and drove rural residents off their land through collapsing agricultural prices due to burgeoning grain imports—the automation and offshoring of their day.</p>

<p>These developments nonetheless personally benefited the wealthy Senatorial and governing elite that wielded government power increasingly for the sole private benefit of its members. This led to spiraling social tensions that, when they flared into violence, were resolved through grudging concessions rather than fundamental—and democratizing—changes.   </p>

<p>The “radical” Warren-esque reforms of the Gracchi, who themselves were highly patrician, arguably aimed to save their own class from themselves as much as saving the Republic, by creating economic safety-valves not unlike the patrician Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal at the depths of the Great Depression. The elites were too selfish, or short-sighted, or both, to see the wisdom—resulting in a violent uprising of the dispossessed known as “the Social War.” Conceptions of a greater good shared broadly amongst a frontier people who had thrown off their king, and came together especially in times of external threat, had long since melted away before the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Politics could no longer bridge the divides, because the threat did not come from without: The enemy was the other within.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>In this <em>res public</em> largely eviscerated of any sense of the “public,” politics and government increasingly degenerated further into the personal.  Wealthy politicians vied for, and alternated in power, with the support of their own personal parties, armed factions, and the communications media of the day (Julius Caesar, with his <em>Commentaries</em> on his subjugation of Gaul, was a master of this). By a half-century after the Gracchi’s reforms were beaten back, extremely different visions of governing structure, social issues, and economics eventually confronted each other for power in the form of essentially personalized states built largely around either Gaius Marius or Lucius Cornelius Sulla.</p>

<p>And that might be where we find ourselves today. While the political parallels are from perfect, Marius, hardly a blameless figure, personified the cause of the <em>populares</em>—what we might think of as more-or-less progressive, advocating for an expanded democracy and economic redistribution. Sulla, a patrician who indulged a fairly libertine, sometimes vulgar, lifestyle even throughout his several marriages, was nonetheless the champion of the economic, social and political conservatives, prevailed and eventually became dictator.</p>

<p>While Roman politics had long been a nasty affair, Sulla was the first to institutionalize “proscription”—the practice of declaring your opponents “enemies of the state” and thereby licensing open-hunting season on them. He also became the first ever to violate perhaps the most deeply-held norm of the Republic’s unwritten constitution—that no general was ever to lead armed forces across the sacred boundary, the <em>pomerium</em>, of Rome itself—which set the precedent for Julius Caesar’s later, and more famous, crossing of the Rubicon that all but marked the end of the Republic, and Rome’s imperfect democracy, for good.</p>

<p>Now, within the last month, President Trump has sent armed forces into American cities—but not the regular armed forces, as he has mooted in the past. He didn’t call up the National Guard, as presidents normally do when responding to emergencies or civil unrest: With military leaders and some troops themselves publicly expressing discomfort after their use against peaceful protests in Washington, DC, Trump needed to find forces more personally loyal to himself—and he did so in the Customs and Border Patrol—outside any existing branch of the military, responding directly to his agenda, arguably beyond his constitutional authority, and targeting dissent ...</p>

<p>But, as is often the case with Trump, creation of this new praetorian guard can alternatively be understood as essentially a business, rather than an ideological, development—simply a further, if more disturbing, extension of his privatization and personalization of the federal government. The fact that this new model army displays no government agency’s insignia on its personnel or vehicles—relying instead on widely-available camouflage rather than government uniforms—means that private militias and vigilantes can easily join forces with it, or even take actions on their own, indistinguishable from these new-fangled government irregulars. As I <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2017-02-07/donald-trump-and-steve-bannon-will-leave-america-hollow">predicted when Trump first took office</a>, the distinction between public and private sectors is melting away before our very eyes even as to the deployment of legitimate force that, ever since the great sociologist Max Weber, has been seen as the defining element of the state.</p>

<p>Coming as it does at the same time that Trump has declared, even more unmistakably than in the past, that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/20/politics/2020-election-transition-trump/index.html">he is not inclined to honor the election results if he loses</a> and then <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/trump-postpone-election/614755/?utm_source=feed">floated delaying them</a>, the creation of what is essentially his own personal army raises the possibility that Trump eventually may create, well, his own personal government.</p>

<p>Many have expressed concerns for some time that Trump would attempt to remain in office if he were defeated, and might rally armed militias to his cause (I’ve raised this concern myself since the night Trump was elected) … But even if he does leave, the likely Trump post-presidency that fits best with his personality and history—not to mention that of the Romans—may be even more troubling and dangerous.</p>

<p>Trump, if he were to lose, might well leave the White House—he never liked the building to begin with, and doesn’t like the actual work of the presidency—but never concede that he lost. He might not be the real President anymore … but he could play one on TV. If he continued to insist that he were the actual, legitimate President of the United States, there can be little doubt that tens of millions of Americans would believe him. And unlike your average crank, Trump has the resources and ability to turn this into a 24/7 TV reality program through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-allies-explore-buyout-of-conservative-news-channel-one-america-news-network-11578696767">his own television network</a>, even further to the right and more reliably sycophantic than FOX—which he reportedly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/10/17/report-trump-may-start-tv-network/92280290/">was considering launching had he not, unexpectedly, won the 2016 election</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine an alternative President, with at least as much media reach as the one actually in the White House, with an unshakably devoted following of perhaps as much as one-third of the country, and perhaps even his own private armed forces—Sulla with a TV station funded by his fellow reactionary patricians, with his own camo-clad stormtroopers picking up and disappearing <em>populare</em> protestors in unmarked vans—and the present looks even more like the late Republic than when I wrote about this less than a year ago. If this occurs, the country would descend into dueling polities, dueling realities, and dueling war zones.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Of course, there are always alternatives: As dysfunctional as the Republic had become, Rome didn’t necessarily need a Caesar. But it <em>did</em> need a modernization of its pre-imperial governance technology—a standing bureaucracy and a streamlined executive to carry out the legislative will would have improved on the existing multi-headed oligarchy at least as well as the succession of terrible emperors did. And a peaceful mechanism for resolving the increasingly disparate interests of Rome’s increasingly disparate and unwieldy empire—broadened and meaningful democracy, for instance, along with progressive economic policies and perhaps a Plebian Lives Matter movement—might have averted a half-millennium of dictatorship dominated not by orderly succession but factional assassinations and coups until even the Empire eventually conceded it couldn’t manage the job and simply partitioned itself.</p>

<p>We face similar choices today. History isn’t destiny. But it <em>is</em> a warning.   </p>

    <p>A couple of people have asked for an update of a chart I put up <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/06/if-covid-19-cases-are-going-up-why-is-the-death-rate-going-down/">a few weeks ago</a> comparing the COVID-19 case rate with the death rate. Here it is:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857971"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857971" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_case_vs_death_august_7.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="616"></figure>
<p>During the first round of COVID-19, the death rate started to decline about two weeks after the case rate began falling. If the same thing happens this time around, deaths have already peaked and will start to decline in about a week or so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this is what will happen. There have been too many surprises already in the COVID-19 numbers, and the actual death rate will depend a lot on how seriously everyone is taking the recommended countermeasures (masks, social distancing, etc.). I can&#8217;t predict that—and neither can anyone else—which means I can&#8217;t predict the death rate trend either.</p>
<p>Still, if the second round of COVID-19 is like the first round, late July would have been a decent baseline guess for peak deaths—which turned out to be the case—and mid-August is our best guess for the start of the decline.</p>

    <p>Jason Snell <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/first-look-macos-big-sur-public-beta/">has an in-depth look at what you can expect from macOS 11.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running it on my secondary Mac, and while there are rough edges, overall, I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time with it considering the design. This has caused me to re-read <a href="https://512pixels.net/2014/10/os-x-yosemite-review/">my review of OS X Yosemite,</a> which was the first release with the &#8220;flatter&#8221; design we still see today in Catalina. In it, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While this new version of OS X is structurally the same as all of its predecessors, there’s not much left of that original Aqua look left.</p>
<p>  Apple didn’t go all iOS 7 on OS X’s ass, though.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That may have finally happened with Big Sur. There&#8217;s a big emphasis on text and large white areas that used to have more color to them. This change is going to be a wild one to watch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toshiba has finally and formally exited the laptop business</p>

<p>Toshiba has made laptops since 1985 and claims to have been the
first to make a mass-market computer in the now-familiar clamshell
form factor. By the 1990s the company was producing solid
workhorses in the Satellite range and started to make meaningful
stretches of mobile work possible with the small, thin and light
Portégé range.</p>

<p>Those products saw Toshiba lead the world for laptop market share
through the late 1990s and retain that position for much of the
2000s. Even as the PC market consolidated in that decade, Toshiba
was often ranked among the top five of all PC vendors despite only
ever dabbling in desktops.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far
the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel
processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity,
next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with
four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option
for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD
camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A summary of what’s new:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Intel CPUs and AMD graphic cards</li>
<li>SSDs across the line, including options for 4 TB and 8 TB</li>
<li>TrueTone</li>
<li>Nano-texture display finish, like the Pro Display XDR ($500)</li>
<li>RAM options up to 128 GB (base configuration is still 8 GB; the high-end 64 and 128 GB options cost $1,000 and $2,600 more, respectively)</li>
<li>1080p FaceTime camera with better low-light performance, and a “studio quality” microphone array like the current MacBook Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>The 21-inch iMac has not been updated, although the base model configurations now have SSDs instead of Fusion Drives. There remains a 1 TB Fusion Drive build-to-order configuration for the 21-inch iMac, which I believe is now the last spinning hard disk Apple sells.</p>

<p>The iMac Pro has not been updated either, although the $5,000 base model is now the 10-core Xeon W configuration, and the old 8-core base model is gone.</p>

    <p>Craig Silverman and Ryan Mac, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individuals that spoke out about the apparent special treatment of
right-wing pages have also faced consequences. In one case, a
senior Facebook engineer collected multiple instances of
conservative figures receiving unique help from Facebook
employees, including those on the policy team, to remove
fact-checks on their content. His July post was removed because it
violated the company’s “respectful communication policy.” After
the engineer’s post was removed, the related internal “tasks” he’d
cited as examples of the alleged special treatment were made
private and inaccessible to employees, according to a Workplace
post from another employee. […]</p>

<p>The engineer joined the company in 2016 and most recently worked
on Instagram. He left the company on Wednesday. One employee on an
internal thread seen by BuzzFeed News said that they received
permission from the engineer to say that the dismissal “was not
voluntary.” […]</p>

<p>News of his firing caused some Facebook employees to say that they
now fear speaking critically about the company in internal
discussions. One person said they were deleting old posts and
comments, while another said this was “hardly the first time the
respectful workplace guidelines have been used to snipe a
prominent critic of company policies/ethics.”</p>

<p>“[He] was a conscience of this company, and a tireless voice for
us doing the right thing,” said another employee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having a conscience does seem like a mismatch for working at Facebook.</p>

<p>This is really an astonishing story, and it’s effectively buried a few hundred words into what’s really a <em>separate</em> but also alarming story about Facebook employees asking Zuckerberg what Facebook is going to do if Trump uses the platform to dispute the election results.</p>

    <p>Ryan Mac, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier this week, a search on Instagram for #JoeBiden would have
surfaced nearly 390,000 posts tagged with the former vice
president’s name along with related hashtags selected by the
platform’s algorithm. Users searching Instagram for #JoeBiden
might also see results for #joebiden2020, as well as pro-Trump
hashtags like #trump2020landslide and #democratsdestroyamerica.</p>

<p>A similar search for #DonaldTrump on the platform, however,
provided a totally different experience. Besides showing 7 million
posts tagged with the president’s name, Instagram did not present
any related hashtags that would have pushed users toward different
content or promoted alternative viewpoints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it was an honest bug, maybe not. But Facebook’s institutional credibility is so low it’s hard to take them at their word. And then there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1291066529031655424">this response from Instagram’s official comms team</a>, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t about politics. Tens of thousands of hashtags were
affected, and your story cherry-picked a handful of those
thousands to fit a sensational narrative. The bug was also not
partisan, as you note #democrats was impacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1291070240533569538">Via Parker Molloy</a>, who notes that this combative tone — expressly impugning Mac’s integrity — is <em>not</em> how Facebook/Instagram has ever responded to accusations of bias against Republicans.</p>

<p>Whatever you think about the purported bug — and as skeptical as I am about Facebook, I actually think there’s a good chance it really was just a bug — this response from their comms teams is the real eye-opener.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also note that Instagram accuses Mac of “cherry-picking” for singling out the Biden/Trump differences. They know those are the only two candidates. How can it be “cherry picking” to compare how Instagram is treating <em>the only two major presidential candidates</em>? What the hell kind of bushel only has two cherries to choose from? And you can’t argue that it was about cherry-picking hashtags, not candidates, when the core hashtags in question were “#JoeBiden” and “#DonaldTrump”.</p>

<p>Whether the Pixel 4A will make a better case than those upcoming phones remains to be seen. But I will tell you that after a couple of weeks, I prefer it over the much more powerful $800 Pixel 4.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a thing to say because I should remind you that the Pixel 4A costs $349.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just get right into the Pixel 4A&rsquo;s best feature: photos. I am happy to report that after dozens of test shots, the Pixel 4A matches the Pixel 4&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Pixel 4A has a one-size-fits-all 5.8-inch display. Google is using a hole-punch for the first time, which allows the screen to go closer to the edges. The bezels are still bigger than what you&rsquo;ll get on a flagship, but they&rsquo;re smaller than many phones at this price point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s $100 cheaper than the iPhone SE with the same amount of storage, but it has a much slower processor.</p>

<p> iPhone SE  photos feature a more natural color palette while the Pixel 4a&rsquo;s photos are cooler in tone, but the Pixel 4a images are sharper and crisper, even when lighting is poor. Google gave the Pixel 4a Night Sight, but Apple&rsquo;s  iPhone SE  doesn&rsquo;t support the Night Mode feature available in more expensive iPhones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand this perception of bigger models in data centers somehow are more accurate, but it&rsquo;s actually wrong. It&rsquo;s actually technically wrong. It&rsquo;s better to run the model close to the data, rather than moving the data around. And whether that&rsquo;s location data&mdash;like what are you doing&mdash; [or] exercise data&mdash;what&rsquo;s the accelerometer doing in your phone&mdash;it&rsquo;s just better to be close to the source of the data, and so it&rsquo;s also privacy preserving.&rdquo;</p>

That means the symbol MARCH1 has now become MARCHF1, while SEPT1 has become SEPTIN1, and so on.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Many gene symbols that can be read as nouns have been renamed to avoid false positives during searches, for example. In the past, CARS has become CARS1, WARS changed to WARS1, and MARS tweaked to MARS1.</p></blockquote>

    <p>My mother has five cats: Tillamook, Luna, and the three stripeys. Luna is shy around strangers, but my sister and I have been around enough over the past few weeks that she&#8217;s finally gotten used to us. Luring her with plates of food helped too. In any case, she now hangs around inside the house sometimes, and she has decided that Tillamook is her favorite uncle. She just loves curling up with him, and Tilly doesn&#8217;t mind either.</p>

    <p>Today brings a new study of COVID-19 with some interesting results. The basic question is whether big, dense cities are more vulnerable to outbreaks than smaller towns and rural areas. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1777891">The authors come to two conclusions:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>High <em>population</em> cities have higher infection rates and higher death rates.</li>
<li>However, high <em>density</em> cities have lower death rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the worst possible place to live is a big city with low density. These are mostly found out west: Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, etc. The best place to live would be a relatively small city with high density: San Francisco, Boston, Washington DC, and so forth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much this matters since most of us can&#8217;t move, but at least it gives you some idea of how dangerous your current residence is.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0977648133/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5 Year Diary by Tamara Shopsin</a> ($25)<br />
The first pick that I have is a little 5-year diary, designed by Tamara Shopsin. I just write down what happened at each day, who I talked to, and I usually end up recording what food I cooked because I&#8217;m big into cooking. I have a log for almost every year of my life. But this is the first time I&#8217;ve really gotten into a five-year journal and I love it. I love this one in particular because it&#8217;s just very simply designed, it&#8217;s very classic. It&#8217;s small, and there&#8217;s just enough room to write a couple of sentences. It&#8217;s very easy to maintain every single day because there&#8217;s no big commitment. And I&#8217;m four years into this book now, so it&#8217;s really starting to pay off because when I write down what happened, then I can look back and see what happened on that day, three years back. And for me that&#8217;s really fun. I think it plays to my natural bent toward nostalgia.  I particularly like the clean and functional design of this journal. So many journals are over-designed.</p>
<p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/fiskarsrotary.jpg" alt="fiskarsrotary" width="500" height="197" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36793" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GHGT72S/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fiskars Titanium Rotary Cutter</a> ($20)<br />
I have really gotten into sewing lately. I&#8217;ve always sewn, but just straight-edged things like curtains or a comforter cover. But in the last year I&#8217;ve really gotten into sewing clothing and much more adventurous items. And it&#8217;s cool to be in my mid 50s, learning a whole new world of skills and tools and trying more and more challenging patterns. And then I discovered the Fiskars rotary cutter and you use it along with a straight edge and it&#8217;s a game changer. It completely just changed the way I work. I&#8217;m a fairly precise person, so just the ability to cut patterns really precisely and cut things exactly to precise inches, which is really more of a challenge to do with sheers where you&#8217;re lifting the fabric and it shifts around more. With this you&#8217;re pressing it down with a straight edge and just running that nice titanium blade along the edge of the straight edge and you get just perfect results. There are a number of other sewing tools I’ve recently discovered and delight in, such as a dedicated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CV7LD6F/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invisible-zipper foot</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B072N2ZPGC/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread snip</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YZ8N46/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seam gauge</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000W5GFIO/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pattern weights</a>, but the rotary cutters have had the biggest impact on my process.</p>
<p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/schaedlerrules.jpg" alt="schaedlerrules" width="500" height="206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36794" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FSGUAG/cooltoolsshow-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Schaedler Precision Rules</a> ($30)<br />
I have had mine for 30 years. And if a ruler could be sexy, this one&#8217;s pretty sexy to me. It&#8217;s just what it sounds like. It&#8217;s a super precise ruler, and it&#8217;s printed on a very thin translucent plastic. I have a set of two of them, and the one I&#8217;m looking at now has inches along one edge down to one 64th of an inch. And it has metric down to half millimeters. And then there&#8217;s picas down the middle, for the first 12, every point is marked. I have another one that has picas along the edge. As a book designer, I am partial to the pica ruler, which has found steady use throughout my career.</p>

<a href="https://www.luglife.com/collections/crossbody/products/moped?variant=19058512920649" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moped Crossbody Bag by Lug</a> ($70)<br />
I have been using the Moped bag as my “everyday” purse for at least 10 years. It’s just the right size&#8211;big enough to hold everything I need for a day (even a light sweater) but not so big that everything is swimming in it. But it’s the POCKETS that I love! So many pockets! There’s a back pocket that fits my iPad perfectly, a handy front pocket for my phone, and a side pocket that I use for glasses, a water bottle, or a compact umbrella. I have a whole system. They come in a lot of different fabrics, but I like the simple gray heather. And it&#8217;s not fancy. I have fancy or evening purses, but I&#8217;m not a purse person. People pay a lot of money for purses. I&#8217;m shocked. This one&#8217;s very affordable.</p>
<p>About <strong><a href="https://cookingwithrockstars.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cooking with Rockstars</a></strong>:<br />
Years ago, starting in 2002, I started doing video interviews with indie rock stars about food. It was called Cooking With Rockstars, and I had the site up from maybe 2002 to 2008. Then the site went offline and I just never came around to getting it started again. There was always something else to do and that was always lower priority. But recently, I was talking with Jeffrey Zeldman who works at Automattic and he gave me the assistance of a team at WordPress who built it for me and we revived it. So it&#8217;s back online. I&#8217;m able to rerelease all of the old videos. I have a whole bunch that were in the can that were never released. They&#8217;re old, but they&#8217;re newly released. And I might, after you can actually do things like visit people again, might do a few new interviews coming up. So I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>

    <p>So how did we do on the jobs front in July? Obviously we&#8217;re in new territory these days, but I think the answer is &#8220;meh&#8221;:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857695"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1269px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857695" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_net_jobs_july_2020.gif" alt="" width="1269" height="753"></figure>
<p>The BLS reports that we gained 1.8 million jobs, which is less than half what we gained in June. On the unemployment front, there were 6.3 million fewer workers who had been unemployed for 5-14 weeks, but 4.6 million more workers who had been unemployed for 15-26 weeks. The industries with the biggest gains were leisure, temp services, and retail.</p>
<p>On the earnings front, the news was all bad: hourly wages of blue-collar workers were down about 5 percent on an annualized basis. Wages for retail workers were down 3.4 percent from June, or 42 percent on an annualized basis. That&#8217;s not a typo. It would appear that retailers took the opportunity of COVID-19 to slash pay for their workers. Isn&#8217;t that lovely?</p>

<p class="">Yesterday marked the release of <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-version-5"><span>Day One, version 5</span></a>. There are several new features of note: </p><p class=""><strong>The Today View</strong></p><p class="">Previously called the Activity Feed, the new Today View ties in other data available to Day One, like location data, calendar events, and daily photos. If you tap on a calendar event, it opens a new entry with that event title as the Day One entry title. Clever.</p><p class=""><strong>PDF Export</strong></p><p class="">The PDF Export feature has a lot more options than it used to. You can export out of a specific journal but only entries with one tag, but no entries with a different tag. Want to export as CSV? It does that now too. It opens up data export.</p><p class=""><strong>The Media Picker</strong></p><p class="">Getting photos and videos into your journal just got easier. </p><p class="">They’ve also added Sign in with Apple, greatly simplifying sign in on your devices. I’m testing out several journaling workflows right now, and this update came just as I’m testing out Day One in earnest—more on this to come.</p><p class=""> </p>

    <p>For the past several days, I’ve been annoying my family with a shortcut. If there are people in your life you want to annoy, you might want to use it. And apart from the annoyance value, it has some Shortcuts programming techniques that I want to memorialize for future use.</p>
<p>My daughter has a dog named Daisy, and on a per-kilobyte basis, she is the biggest topic of conversation in the family texts. There are lots of texts about Daisy, and most of them are photos of her. Even so, there’s never enough Daisy, so I wrote a shortcut to amplify the Daisy content. It takes a single picture of Daisy,</p>
<p><img alt="Daisy single" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Daisy%20single.jpg" title="Daisy single" width="50%"/></p>
<p>and makes a grid (or <em>small multiple</em>, as Tufte would have it) of Daisys.</p>
<p><img alt="Untinted Daisy" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Untinted%20Daisy.jpg" title="Untinted Daisy" width="80%"/></p>
<p>As an option, I can apply a random tint to the component images.</p>
<p><img alt="Tinted Daisy" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Tinted%20Daisy.jpg" title="Tinted Daisy" width="80%"/></p>
<p>I’ve called this shortcut <span class="menu">Warhol</span> for what should be <a href="https://www.artetrama.com/blogs/news/about-andy-warhols-sunday-b-morning-marilyn-monroe-series">obvious reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Using the shortcut is simple. Upon launching Warhol, you’re asked to choose an image from Photos.<sup id="fnref:share"><a href="#fn:share" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> When that’s done, you’re asked to choose the grid size:</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing grid size" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Choosing%20grid%20size.png" title="Choosing grid size" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Finally, you’re asked if you want the images tinted or not.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c7d2a77c999349608e6b4e0c4fc2b6e3">download the shortcut</a> and install it. As we’ll see in the description, Warhol does require a bit of external setup: a Photos album named Tints that contains 1×1 PNG images of a single color. Here’s what my Tints album looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Tints album" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200806-Tints%20album.jpg" title="Tints album" width="50%"/></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/downloads/Tints.zip">download this zip file</a> of my tints, but don’t feel restricted to these colors. Warhol will work with whatever you put in the Tints album. The only restriction—unless you change the Warhol source code—is that the album must be named Tints.</p>
<p>Here are the steps of Warhol:</p>

<p>The numerical trick in choosing the sizes is to come up with a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 that is the width you want for the final image (ignoring the 1-pixel separator lines). This will have to be a multiple of 120, which is the least common multiple of those numbers. I chose a final image size of 3840, which I sometimes think is too large, but I do like to zoom in on the individual images and still have decent detail. If you don’t want to use storage space and bandwidth as profligately as I do, choose a smaller multiple of 120 (1200? 2400?) and divide that by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 to get the <code>width</code>s.</p>
<p>It’s not obvious how to use a variable as the repetition count in a Repeat loop, as is done in Steps 7 and 13. When you first add a Repeat step, you’re given a count that you can change by tapping the plus or minus buttons that appear when you touch the count button.</p>
<p><img alt="Repeat action" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Repeat%20action.jpg" title="Repeat action" width="50%"/></p>
<p>To use a variable for the count instead of a predefined number, you have to <em>press and hold</em> on the count button. A menu like this will appear,</p>
<p><img alt="Variable repetition menu" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200806-Variable%20repetition%20menu.png" title="Variable repetition menu" width="50%"/></p>
<p>and you’ll be able to choose either a regular variable or a magic variable for the number of repetitions. This is a terrible, undiscoverable design decision. And even after I did discover it (through Googling), I was disappointed to see that the step reads “Repeat count” instead of “Repeat count times.”</p>
<p>You may be wondering where the <code>photos</code> variable in Steps 10 and 14 came from. Basically, it gets made up on the spot and accumulates additional values in a list with each pass through the loop. Here’s the description of <span class="menu">Add to Variable</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appends this action’s input to the specified variable, creating the variable if it does not exist.</p>
<p>This allows you to make a variable hold multiple items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re used to writing in stricter languages, it may bother you that you don’t have to initialize <code>photos</code> with an empty list before adding values to it. If you’ve programmed in Perl, you’ll probably feel right at home.</p>
<p>I often feel guilty about presenting a completed automation, one that I’ve spent a lot of time writing and rewriting to make clearer, more efficient, and more idiomatic to the language in which it’s written. I can assure you that even a silly program like Warhol didn’t spring out fully formed, like Athena from Zeus’s head. It started out both much simpler, in that it handled fewer grid sizes and couldn’t tint the images, and more complicated, in that it didn’t take advantage of some of the niceties of Shortcuts.</p>
<p>For example, the earliest versions of Warhol presented only a few grid sizes and used a repetitive <span class="menu">Choose from Menu</span> section to set the size of the list of images. It was only after I had the basic logic of the shortcut worked out that I switched to using the dictionary of dictionaries to handle the different grid sizes. That change cleaned up a lot of code.</p>
<p>The earlier versions of Warhol also had no logic for resizing the base image before assembling it into a list of images. The <span class="menu">Resize Image</span> step came at the end, only after <span class="menu">Combine Images</span> had created a truly enormous grid image, usually well over 10,000 pixels wide. These early versions often ran <em>very</em> slowly because of all the data they were slinging around.</p>
<p>I don’t consider any of these inefficiencies in code size or running time to be bugs. They were part of my normal process of development:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order my thoughts to understand what the problem is and how to solve it.</li>
<li>Work out some code that implements that solution.</li>
<li>Improve the code to make it tighter, easier to understand, and, if necessary, faster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 usually lead to revisions in what I came up with in Step 1. Working out a solution almost always gives me a better understanding of what the problem really is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Warhol is a solution in search of a problem. It’s the kind of automation I create because I think writing it would be fun and I would learn something in the process. On those terms, it was a success.</p>

<p id="p2">There is far more media I&rsquo;d like to try than I have time for. Between TV shows, movies, music, books and other reading, podcasts, and videogames, the supply of content far outstrips the time I have by an order of magnitude. As a result, I&rsquo;m both picky and often slow to getting around to some media, especially games, which often require a substantial time commitment. The trouble is that it&rsquo;s easy to lose track of games I&rsquo;ve read about, that someone has recommended, and even those that I&rsquo;m in the middle of playing if I can&rsquo;t play regularly.</p>
<p id="p3">I&rsquo;ve approached the problem in a lot of different ways. Text notes are a quick and portable solution but lack detail. Apps designed to track lots of different kinds of media have the benefit of consolidating everything in one place, but often don&rsquo;t accommodate features specific to one kind of media. As a result, I&rsquo;ve recently gravitated to apps that focus on just a single type of media. For videogames, that solution has been <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameTrack</a>, an app that we&rsquo;ve covered in our <a href="https://club.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> newsletters in the past.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/231C5250-34E5-40AA-AEA1-73AE47E8C62E-1596795907551-1596816726626.png" alt="GameTrack&rsquo;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists."><p class="image-caption">GameTrack&rsquo;s Backlog, Archive, Wish List, and Ranked lists.</p></div>
<p id="p6">The app&rsquo;s tab bar is divided into four sections: Lists, Discover, Activity, and Statistics. GameTrack comes with three default lists: Backlog, Archive, and Wish List. If you subscribe you can add more lists, including ranked lists which are a fun way to pick your favorite games for a system, genre, or franchise. Backlog can be further divided into Now Playing, Play Next, and Collection, and Archive into Finished, Completed, and Abandoned. Wish List is organized by release date and can send you notifications when the games listed there become available. You can pick the platform you&rsquo;re playing on when more than one is available, and games on your lists can be sorted and grouped based on multiple criteria too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9400BCF7-FAC3-4D7D-A23E-99EB22D1033D-1596796253404%202-1596817161692.png" alt="Each game&rsquo;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork."><p class="image-caption">Each game&rsquo;s entry includes details drawn from the IGDB database and rich artwork.</p></div>
<p id="p8">Each game in a list includes a summary of it pulled from the IGDB database, screenshots, trailers, ratings, release date, genre, critic rating, and other metadata. GameTrack lets you move items between lists and customize entries with alternate artwork from a game&rsquo;s detail view. You can also specify a completion percentage and take notes, which is a handy way to save a URL of a game&rsquo;s review, leave reminders to yourself about what you want to do next in a game, or remember who recommended it. Editable metadata is also accessible from a context menu when you long-press on a game&rsquo;s artwork. I only wish that URLs saved in notes were links that would open in Safari View Controller so I could view them easily in-app.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/FA5300DD-2994-42E6-ADB6-5F76C79078C0-1596796516400-1596817287430.png" alt="The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games."><p class="image-caption">The Discover tab is a terrific way to browse games.</p></div>
<p id="p10">The Discover tab allows you to browse games in the IGDB database in categories like Featured, Popular, Upcoming, Recent, Hyped, and Just Added, as well as by platform and a handful of popular franchises. You can also search for games that you want to add to your lists from this tab.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/C7F88E3B-362C-44E5-ADB6-BCC7009B230F-1596797001359-1596817395326.png" alt="Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack."><p class="image-caption">Activity includes games you and the people you follow have added to GameTrack.</p></div>
<p id="p12">The Activity tab serves as a reverse chronological log of games you&rsquo;ve added and to which lists. Here, you&rsquo;ll also find entries of anyone you follow. The feature is powered by Sign In with Apple and syncs across devices. I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time with the Follow feature, but account activity along with lists syncs quickly and reliably and it&rsquo;s easy to find and follow someone if you know what their username is, or if they share a link to their profile with you. It would be nice to discover users you don&rsquo;t know that have similar tastes in games, but that isn&rsquo;t currently possible.</p>
<p id="p13">Despite the discovery limitations, I like the Activity feed a lot because it provides an opportunity to connect with other users to share the games you love. The app also allows you to share individual games using the share sheet, but I&rsquo;d like to share full lists of games with friends and collaborate on lists too.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3C4FC41E-45E9-44B0-AC1D-DDA50561DC23-1596797283127-2-1596817800383.png" alt="From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games."><p class="image-caption">From the Account tab, you can share your profile, view recent activity, and browse statistics about your games.</p></div>
<p id="p15">The final tab is a combination Account and statistics view. From here, you can view followers and who you follow, access settings, and view and share or delete posts in your activity feed. You can also see statistics about the games in your lists broken down by categories like genre, platform, personal ratings, and your history of archiving games. Finally, you can log into your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam accounts to track information from them as well.</p>
<p id="p16">Settings are worth mentioning, too, because GameTrack is highly customizable if you are a subscriber. You can change the app&rsquo;s theme, layout, tint color, and app icon, personalizing it to suit your tastes. I particularly like the new default icon and alternative icons, which have added depth and a touch of realism to the icon&rsquo;s D-pad. Of course, the original version is available too, in multiple colors and special variants. Settings is also where you can manage the details of your GameTrack account, connect your Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam accounts, and export your library data.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4917B2DF-E3B1-4CC0-91C8-D85D8A63971C-1596797572286-1596817596854.png" alt="GameTrack on the iPad."><p class="image-caption">GameTrack on the iPad.</p></div>
<p id="p18">I&rsquo;ve primarily used GameTrack on my iPhone, where the colorful game art tiles and slide-up card interface work especially well for navigating lists and searching for games. The tab bar design doesn&rsquo;t translate as well to the iPad, where it is split across three columns. If my iPad is connected to a keyboard, the keyboard row often covers up GameTrack&rsquo;s tab bar. I can hide the keyboard row, but it still makes navigating GameTrack too difficult. Also, as you switch tabs, the content in the second and third tabs don&rsquo;t update until you select something new, which can lead to confusing or irrelevant information being displayed in them. On the iPad, GameTrack would probably benefit from considering the new sidebar layout offered with iPadOS 14, which is something developer Joe Kimberlin-Wyer has said <a href="https://twitter.com/joekw/status/1281308221806981121?s=21" rel="noopener noreferrer">he is working on</a>.</p>
<hr id="hr19"><p id="p20">Despite a somewhat awkward iPad design and some wishes here and there, I love GameTrack. Now, when someone recommends a game, I quickly drop it into my Wish List for the next time I&rsquo;m in the mood for a new game and have the time to play it. That&rsquo;s a much better system than buying a game on a whim and letting it sit for months before I try it for the first time.</p>
<p id="p21">I&rsquo;ve also found myself browsing the Discover tab a lot, too, especially when I get behind on the videogame news that I usually follow. It&rsquo;s a quick way to get a fix of the latest popular games and watch a few trailers, which open in Safari View Controller so I don&rsquo;t have to leave the app.</p>
<p id="p22">Videogames have been one of my outlets as I&rsquo;ve spent more time at home during the global pandemic. They&rsquo;ve served an important entertainment role, allowing me to escape from the constant barrage of bad news for a little while. GameTrack has reduced the friction of starting a new game, even if I&rsquo;ve been away from gaming for a while, by always having something ready on one of my lists, which I love. If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to organize your gaming life, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with GameTrack.</p>
<p id="p23">GameTrack <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available on the App Store</a> as a free download. Custom icons and lists, ranked lists, tints, themes, layouts, and automatically updating release dates for games are all part of a $0.99/month or $7.99/year subscription.</p>

    <p>Pursuant to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/microsoft-ends-cloud-streaming-beta-for-ios-preps-android-only-launch/">the announcement earlier this week that Microsoft would not be bringing its xCloud game streaming service to iOS</a>, the two companies have exchanged fire over where the blame lies. First, Apple lashed out, providing a statement to several outlets, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations">including The Verge</a>, confirming that xCloud violates the App Store guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.</p>
<p>  Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack there, but let’s just start by noting that the requirement to vet all individual games is, let me be frank, a load of hooey. Apple doesn’t review all the titles available on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or any of the myriad of streaming services that have apps on the App Store. Nor does it check every book title available on the Kindle, Nook, or Kobo apps. But we’ll get back to that in a moment.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn’t take long to shoot back, issuing its own statement to several publications, including Gizmodo:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Our testing period for the Project xCloud preview app for iOS has expired. Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store. Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content. All games available in the Xbox Game Pass catalog are rated for content by independent industry ratings bodies such as the ESRB and regional equivalents. We are committed to finding a path to bring cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to the iOS platform. We believe that the customer should be at the heart of the gaming experience and gamers tell us they want to play, connect and share anywhere, no matter where they are. We agree.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Microsoft has a number of good points here. First, that all of its games are already reviewed and issued content ratings by the ESRB, an industry organization that’s essentially the MPAA for games. Second, that Apple does seem to treat gaming apps differently from other streaming apps, as I noted above.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time recently that Microsoft—and I get it, it’s rich, <em>Microsoft</em>—has attacked Apple because of anticompetitive behavior. Ahead of the antitrust hearings in Washington last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-us-congress-apple-app-store-fees-104527483.html">Microsoft had already expressed concern about Apple’s position with the App Store</a>. It’s entirely possible Microsoft knew this particular fight was brewing, but it also seems as though Redmond had already run afoul of App Store restrictions with other products, like Office.</p>
<p>All of this boils down to things not looking great for Apple and the App Store. Cupertino has doubled down on its defenses, with Tim Cook insisting that it treats everybody the same, but the best you can say for that is that it’s an Obi-Wan Kenobi-style equivocation about it being true from a certain point of view.</p>
<p>As Apple has become the most valuable company in the world, it’s increasingly clear that its biggest threat is itself. Throw out whatever cliché axiom you prefer—power corrupts, or the road to hell being paved with good intentions—but Apple certainly seems to increasingly have become one of those entities that will go to any lengths to protect its people, even if that means verging into the authoritarian.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I no sooner hit publish on this piece than I saw <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/07/facebook-criticizes-apples-app-store-policies/">this story</a> about Apple forcing the Facebook Gaming app to launch with no games in it, due to App Store rules. Certainly provides more ammunition for Microsoft’s argument that Apple treats games differently. Moreover, this seems to look even more transparently bad from a competitive standpoint, as Apple Arcade clearly benefits from these moves.</em></p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-microsoft-spar-over-cloud-gaming-against-antitrust-backdrop/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been just over a month since President Trump signed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, so guess what he did today? He turned right around and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-reimpose-aluminum-tariffs-on-canada-11596747137">placed new tariffs on Canadian aluminum:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House said <strong>certain types of aluminum were surging into the U.S.,</strong> depressing the U.S. industry. The administration justified the tariffs, which will be set at 10%, using a national security provision and argued that a depressed U.S. aluminum industry threatens U.S. national security.</p>
<p>“Earlier today I signed a proclamation that defends American industry by reimposing aluminum tariffs on Canada,” President Trump said during a speech at a Whirlpool factory in Clyde, Ohio. <strong>“Canada was taking advantage of us, as usual,”</strong> he said. “The aluminum business was being decimated by Canada, very unfair to our jobs and our great aluminum workers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about &#8220;certain types&#8221; of aluminum, but it&#8217;s pretty easy to dig up <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/country/sitc/index.html">total US imports of aluminum from Canada:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857586"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857586" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_canada_aluminum_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="619"></figure>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but it doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like there&#8217;s been a surge in aluminum imports from Canada. Maybe there is if you do it by tonnes instead of dollars? Or if you look only at certain specialized types of aluminum products? Or something.</p>
<p>More likely, Trump still hasn&#8217;t gotten over being humiliated by Justin Trudeau at that G7 meeting a few years ago. That&#8217;s more his style.</p>

    <p>A few years ago I wrote a post about new research into the cause of Japanese surrender in World War II. Today is the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, and I thought it might be interesting to repost it. Here it is.</p>
<hr width="30%">
<p>There has long been a scholarly debate about whether it was necessary for the United States to use atomic weapons to bring World War II to an end. Traditionalists say yes: If not for Fat Man and Little Boy, Japan would have fought to the last man. But revisionists argue that by August of 1945: (a) Japan&#8217;s situation was catastrophically hopeless; (b) they knew it and were ready to surrender; and (c) thanks to decoded Japanese diplomatic messages, Harry Truman and other American leaders knew they were ready. A Japanese surrender could have been negotiated in fairly short order with or without the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>For various reasons I&#8217;ve always found the revisionist view unsatisfactory. After all, even <em>after</em> the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, we know there was still considerable debate within the Japanese war cabinet over their next step. Surely if Japan had already been close to unconditional surrender in early August—and for better or worse, unconditional surrender was an American requirement—the atomic demonstration of August 6 would have been more than enough to tip them over the edge. But it didn&#8217;t. It was only after the second bomb was dropped that Japan ultimately agreed to surrender.</p>
<p>But although the revisionist view has never persuaded me, a new revisionist view has been swirling around the academic community for several years—and this one seems much more interesting. Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, a trilingual English/Russian/Japanese historian, reminds us that the actual timeline of Japanese surrender went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>August 6:</strong> Hiroshima bomb dropped.</p>
<p><strong>August 8:</strong> Soviet Union declares war on Japan and invades Manchuria.</p>
<p><strong>August 9:</strong> Nagasaki bomb dropped.</p>
<p><strong>August 10:</strong> Emperor Hirohito breaks the cabinet deadlock and decides that Japan must surrender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="image image-_original" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 8px 20px 15px 30px;" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/images/blog_hiroshima_atomic_bomb.jpg" alt="" align="right"></p>
<p>So what really caused the Japanese to finally give up? Was it America&#8217;s atomic bombs, or was it the Soviet Union&#8217;s entrance into the Pacific war? Hasegawa, based on meticulous research into primary sources, argues that it was probably the latter—though not quite in the way we usually think. <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/08/07/why_did_japan_surrender/?page=full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gareth Cook summarizes Hasegawa&#8217;s argument in the <em>Boston Globe</em>:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to his close examination of the evidence, Japan was not poised to surrender before Hiroshima, as the revisionists argued, nor was it ready to give in immediately after the atomic bomb, as traditionalists have always seen it.…Americans, then and today, have tended to assume that Japan&#8217;s leaders were simply blinded by their own fanaticism, forcing a catastrophic showdown for no reason other than their refusal to acknowledge defeat.…But Hasegawa and other historians have shown that Japan&#8217;s leaders were in fact quite savvy, well aware of their difficult position, and holding out for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>Their concern was not so much whether to end the conflict, but how to end it while holding onto territory, avoiding war crimes trials, and preserving the imperial system. The Japanese could still inflict heavy casualties on any invader, <strong>and they hoped to convince the Soviet Union, still neutral in the Asian theater, to mediate a settlement with the Americans.</strong> Stalin, they calculated, might negotiate more favorable terms in exchange for territory in Asia. It was a long shot, but it made strategic sense.</p>
<p>On Aug. 6, the American bomber Enola Gay dropped its payload on Hiroshima.…As Hasegawa writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Racing-Enemy-Stalin-Truman-Surrender/dp/0674022416/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313639560&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Racing the Enemy,&#8221;</a> the Japanese leadership reacted with concern, but not panic.…Very late the next night, however, something happened that did change the plan. The Soviet Union declared war and launched a broad surprise attack on Japanese forces in Manchuria. In that instant, Japan&#8217;s strategy was ruined. <strong>Stalin would not be extracting concessions from the Americans.</strong> And the approaching Red Army brought new concerns: The military position was more dire, and it was hard to imagine occupying communists allowing Japan&#8217;s traditional imperial system to continue. Better to surrender to Washington than to Moscow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some sense, the real answer here is probably unknowable. Two events happened at nearly the same time, and they were closely followed by a third. Figuring out conclusively what caused what may simply not be possible. Probably they both played a role. Still, aside from the documentary evidence that Hasegawa amasses, his theory accounts for other aspects of the war. Like the dog that didn&#8217;t bark in the night, Japan didn&#8217;t give up after the fire bombing of Tokyo. Nor did Germany surrender after the fire bombing of Dresden. And although it&#8217;s undeniably true that atomic bombs are a more dramatic way of destroying a city than conventional weaponry, it&#8217;s also undeniably true that simply destroying a city was never enough to produce a surrender. So why would destroying a city with an atomic bomb be that much different?</p>
<p>This is fascinating stuff. At the same time, I think that Cook takes a step too far when he suggests that Hasegawa&#8217;s research, if true, should fundamentally change our view of atomic weapons. &#8220;If the atomic bomb alone could not compel the Japanese to submit,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;then perhaps the nuclear deterrent is not as strong as it seems.&#8221; But that hardly follows. America in 1945 had an air force capable of leveling cities with conventional weaponry. We still do—though barely—but no other country in the world comes close. With an atomic bomb and a delivery vehicle, North Korea can threaten to destroy Seoul. Without it, they can&#8217;t. And larger atomic states, like the US, India, Pakistan, and Russia, have the capacity to do more than just level a city or two. They can level entire countries.</p>
<p>So, no: Hasegawa&#8217;s research is fascinating for what it tells us about a key event in history. But should it change our view of atomic weaponry or atomic deterrence? I doubt it. It&#8217;s not 1945 anymore.</p>

    <p>New York Times correspondent Vivian Yee, from Beirut:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was just about to look at a video a friend had sent me on
Tuesday afternoon — “the port seems to be burning,” she said — when my whole building shook. Uneasily, naïvely, I ran to the
window, then back to my desk to check for news.</p>

<p>Then came a much bigger boom, and the sound itself seemed to
splinter. There was shattered glass flying everywhere. Not
thinking but moving, I ducked under my desk.</p>

<p>When the world stopped cracking open, I couldn’t see at first
because of the blood running down my face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A remarkable tale of kindness and humanity amidst chaos, confusion, and suffering — all the more incredible that Yee wrote it within hours.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.wooji-juice.com/blog/stupid-swiftui-tricks-equal-sizes.html">
<p>But the layout engine has a significant limitation: unlike Auto Layout, it&rsquo;s strictly one-way. Superviews tell subviews how much space they have available, not the other way around. This makes many common tasks fairly straightforward, but it lacks some of the features of Auto Layout &mdash; most notably, equal-size constraints.</p>
<p>These are useful where you want some controls to be the same width, height, or both, but you don&rsquo;t know in advance what that size will be &mdash; typically because it&rsquo;s based on the size of a text label, and you want to support accessibility and localisation, which means different size fonts and different length labels.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Everyone focuses on the declarative part, because that one word leaked out into the media before it was officially announced, and so people latched on to it. [&#8230;] But the other parts are important too, and here we see the composability part in action: even though there&rsquo;s a gap in the layout engine, and it&rsquo;s quite a bit of hassle to fill, we can take that mess, and turn it into an easily-reusable component or set of components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like something that should be easy, though.</p>

    <p>So here we are, at the end of OS X. Two decades ago Apple parked the sixteen-year-old Classic Mac OS and leaped to version 10.0, but four years ago the company rebranded the software that drives the Mac as macOS, and the writing was on the wall. And now in 2020 it’s macOS Big Sur, version 11.0. The name is an extension of Apple’s use of California places to brand its Mac releases, but the version number is the real story. The Mac OS X era is truly over. macOS Big Sur is the start of a radically new era in the Mac’s life.</p>
<p>With the release of the macOS Big Sur Public Beta, Apple is inviting users to get a head start on the journey that will eventually lead to Macs running Apple-designed processors and software built for iPhones and iPads alongside apps made specifically for the Mac. With <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/what-changes-might-be-coming-to-new-mac-hardware/">huge changes to Mac hardware looming on the horizon</a>, Apple has made the biggest design changes to macOS since the launch of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Last year’s macOS Catalina felt like a release designed to settle old scores and clear the field for future advancement. It broke a lot of old software, frustrated a lot of users, and generally had the worst reputation of any macOS update in a decade. (I see you, Mac OS X Lion.) Did Apple sacrifice Catalina so that future OS updates wouldn’t be blamed for them? That’s probably a conspiracy theory too far, but I will say this: Good Cop macOS Big Sur fills me with excitement about the future of the Mac in a way Bad Cop Catalina never did.</p>
<p><span id="more-12331"></span></p>
<h2>The new macOS design</h2>
<p>When Apple makes major operating-system design changes, they tend to start out a bit extreme and then get beaten into shape over time—until they become boring and are replaced by a new design. There are definitely some aggressive, challenging changes in the macOS Big Sur design that will throw long-time Mac users for a loop. And I expect that some of them will end up getting re-thought by Apple’s designers, if not this summer than over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>That said, a lot of aspects of the Big Sur already feel comfortable—probably because I also use an iPhone and an iPad (as do most Mac users) and Big Sur is picking up aspects of the design of those devices. Big Sur’s design has a lot of rough edges, but it also has a lot of potential.</p>
<h3>High-contrast windows</h3>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-finder-composite.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Windows in Big Sur are very white (or very dark grey).</figcaption></figure><p>If the atom of the Mac interface is the window, then Apple has split the atom in Big Sur. The first time you look at a Finder window in Big Sur, you will realize that the Mac you have known for years is gone. Let’s start with the sheer lightness (or in Dark Mode, darkness) of it all: the gray gradient of the title bar and toolbar is gone, replaced by a white (or very dark gray) space that’s populated with the contents of both the title bar and toolbar, collapsed into a single row of items. Toolbar icons are simple glyphs that only gain an outline when you mouse over them. The title, once centered, has been aligned to the left and made bolder, with its icon hidden (until you mouse over). The Back and Forward buttons are perched on the extreme left, even beyond the title of the window. The Search box is now gone, collapsed by default—you must click the Search icon to make it appear.</p>
<p>Apple has also altered the geography of the window itself, in a move that was telegraphed with the design of several apps, including Music, Podcasts, Reminders, and Maps, in macOS Catalina. Previously, a normal Mac window was best thought of as a single space with a title bar and toolbar spanning its entire width, and within it could be a content area or a sidebar and content area. But if you have a window with a sidebar in Big Sur, the geography is different. The window is instead sectioned in two, with the sidebar and the red/yellow/green “traffic light” buttons on the left (with a slightly translucent background), and the title bar, toolbar, and content area on the right.</p>
<p>SF Symbols, Apple’s library of glyphs, has been added to macOS with Big Sur, and it lends an air of consistency to toolbars and sidebars. The appearance of colored glyphs in sidebars—favorites in the Finder are blue, for example—is a pleasant addition. Even the venerable “disclosure triangle” that you can click to reveal the contents of a folder has been reduced—it’s lost its third edge and its gray fill color, and is now just a carat. (It also appears in sidebars as a way to collapse or expand lists of sub-items, replacing the word “Hide” that appears in Catalina.)</p>
<p>While the density in the toolbar has gone way up, the rest of the window has spaced out. There’s much more space between the red/yellow/green “traffic light”  buttons and the edge of the window, and the same is true of the additional white space above and to the right of the title bars/toolbar.</p>
<p>The windows of apps that haven’t been updated to support this new format will receive a more minor makeover. The title bar will be white (or dark gray), and the title font is now bold, but the title is still centered and there’s none of the additional padding that’s been added to new-style Big Sur windows.</p>
<h3>Make room for Big Sur</h3>
<p>Adding more padding is a recurring theme in Big Sur. Apple has also made the menu bar taller (as well as making it distractingly translucent). The menus themselves now sport curved edges at the top (which seems wrong metaphorically?), and there’s additional space between each menu items.</p>
<p>The big question is, does this mean that Apple is preparing for a future where Mac screens also support touch input, so that you could navigate a menu with your finger in a pinch? It sure feels that way, but I’m open to the possibility that Apple just thinks that our displays are big enough now that they can afford to look a little less cramped. I wonder what this design decision means for the future of tiny Apple laptops. I know I’d be frustrated if my old 11-inch MacBook Air was this inefficient with space.</p>
<p>It also feels that everything in Big Sur is rounded at the edges, from windows to menu items to alerts to the Dock to the icons… it’s consistent, and in keeping with most of Apple’s hardware designs, which eschew sharp edges. It makes me wonder why Apple didn’t just mask the corners of the screen in Big Sur (as they were on the original Mac) to make them feel equally curved. The right angles at the corner of my display seem awfully jarring when I’m using Big Sur.</p>
<p>Speaking of icons, I should mention that Apple has <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/dr-icon-and-the-icons-of-big-sur/">redesigned all of its app icons</a> and appears to be all in on making the iOS-style rounded rectangle the standard on macOS as well. Every single Apple icon is a roundrect, and given that future Macs will be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps, perhaps it makes sense to strive for some sort of icon harmony.</p>
<p>That said, Apple’s icons are peculiarly inconsistent when it comes to items placed in front of the roundrect, such as the (outmoded) hard drive in Disk Utility, the loupe in Preview, and the chess piece in Chess. Not only do these items break the silhouette of the roundrect shape, which spoils the entire point, but they’re not even placed consistently—they’re all viewed from somewhat different perspectives.</p>
<p>I’m also not sold on some of the additional detail Apple has added to the icons. Apple says that the level of detail in the new Mac icons is intended to be an homage to the rich icons from OS X’s past. But at most sizes, the added shading to the Messages icon just makes it look dusty. And I guess adding a line of text on the back of the Mail icon’s envelope is a fun easter egg, but at certain sizes it’s just a nondescript line that kind of looks like a mistake.</p>
<p>If you happen to be someone who designs app icons, though, you will be cheering. One look at the Dock in Big Sur will tell you who has gotten with the program and who is, in the words of Steve Jobs, a “laggard app.” Circles? Random shapes? They stick out like sore thumbs. Apps with existing iOS counterparts will probably just use versions of those icons; every other Mac app is going to need a roundrect icon update to avoid looking hideously out of step with the times.</p>
<p>The Dock itself has, of course, also gotten a makeover. It’s more translucent (which is fine, since there are no legibility problems with icons like there are with text in the menu bar), it’s floated away from the edge of the window (there’s that trend toward more padding again), and of course the corners are aggressively rounded.</p>
<h3>Revolution in the menu bar</h3>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-controlcenter.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Control Center in Big Sur.</figcaption></figure><p>Another major change to macOS is happening in the upper right corner of the menu bar, where Apple has introduced Control Center and redesigned Notification Center. Both of these moves have a lot of potential, but I’m less impressed with the execution.</p>
<p>When you click on the new Control Center menu bar item, you’ll see a Mac expression of the Control Center concept that’s been on the iPhone and iPad for a while now. Essentially, Apple is grouping a bunch of common device controls in a single sub-menu, rather than putting them all under individual menu bar items. If you <em>do</em> want an individual menu bar item for a particular control, you can drag it out of Control Center and into the menu bar to add it. (But it remains in Control Center, too.)</p>
<p>Control Center offers controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirDrop, Do Not Disturb, keyboard brightness, AirPlay Display, display brightness and related controls, volume level and other sound controls, and a Now Playing item for media control. Many of these controls are simple sliders and buttons, but when you mouse over them you’re offered a carat symbol that leads to more in-depth settings.</p>
<p>It’s a nice idea, but the execution is a mixed bag. You can remove some items from Control Center (via the Dock and Menu Bar area in System Preferences), but not others. I like the idea of pulling a lot of stray icons out of the menu bar, and giving users a single place to go to adjust a lot of device settings. But there needs to be more customizability and consistency.</p>
<p>To access the new Notification Center, you click on the clock in the menu bar, rather than the previous Notification Center icon. I’m all for reducing menu bar clutter, but this doesn’t make sense to me. Notification Center isn’t related to the clock in any way. This is Apple attempting to cut corners and hide one thing underneath another in order to save space. There should be a Notification Center menu bar item, separate from the clock.</p>
<p>Appearing underneath the clock when you click on it (or if you swipe from the right edge of a trackpad) is a remixed Notification Center that’s a lot better than the previous version. Gone is separation between Today and Notification views—there’s a single view with notifications at the top and widgets below. Notifications are now grouped by app and they’re limited to a few slots, with a button to view more notifications below them, so they don’t consume all the space. It’s a more iOS-like approach, and it’s an improvement, though I feel like I’ve never really properly used Notification Center on the Mac and I’m not sure this will improve matters.</p>
<p>Below the notifications is where the fun really begins, though. The new-style widgets from iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 are also present in Big Sur. Widgets come in three sizes and you can configure them to display how you like. I doubt that the Mac will ever be as big a home for widgets as iPhone or iPad, but I’m glad they exist. It might be nice if you could choose to drag widgets out of Notification Center and plop them on your Desktop, too. But it’s a nice addition to macOS that also brings across some family unity with Apple’s other devices. If you like that weather widget you’ve got on iOS, you can get in on your Mac, too.</p>
<p>It’s early days in beta season so I won’t judge Apple’s widgets too harshly, but they do seem a bit buggy. I was unable to reorder cities in the World Time widget, for example, and sometimes widgets didn’t seem to be serving out updated data. I hope that Apple works the bugs out over the summer.</p>
<h2>App changes</h2>
<p>As always, a new operating system means changes to many of the apps Apple includes with the operating system. This year Apple has made a bunch of changes to Safari—which, for those of us who don’t use an alternate web browser, might just be the most-used app on our Macs. There are also new apps that have been imported from iPadOS via Mac Catalyst, and a raft of other changes. Here are some of the highlights.</p>
<h3>Safari</h3>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-safari-start.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The redesigned Start page lets you add a background image and customize what appears on it.</figcaption></figure><p>I am a loyal Safari user, across all of Apple’s platforms. And I’ve got an admission to make: I use the Start page. That page that feels like the web-browser equivalent of a super-uncool, AOL-start-page, MySpace-using, “gateway to the ‘Net”? That Start page. I don’t use it exclusively—on the Mac, at least, I also keep a row of toolbar favorites visible at all times. But I have gravitated toward using it on my iPad, and that has in turn trained me to use it more on my Mac, too.</p>
<p>In Safari 14—which, as is generally the case, will appear not just on Big Sur but will also be available for macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave—the Start page has gotten a nice upgrade. You can now customize it with a background image of your choosing, which is fun, but you can also click on an icon in the bottom corner of the screen and choose which sorts of items you want to see in the Start page: Favorites and Frequently Visited, of course, but also Siri Suggestions, Reading List, and the new Privacy Report feature that sums up what Safari has been doing to prevent anyone from tracking you from site to site.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-tracker.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Tracking trackers in Big Sur.</figcaption></figure><p>Privacy Report also appears in the Safari toolbar by default. Click on it when you’re on any webpage and it’ll give you a report about how many cross-site trackers that Safari encountered. There’s not really anything you can do with this information, so it’s more of an advertisement for Apple’s laudable attempts to guard the privacy of its users than an actual feature unto itself.</p>
<p>I’m also not a fan of the way the information is presented by Privacy Report: It lists how many “trackers prevented,” but it’s not actually preventing the “trackers” from working—it’s just preventing the information they gather from tracking you when you visit different sites. And many of the “trackers”, like Google Analytics and ChartBeat, are arguably not trackers at all.</p>
<p>I’m also a bit disappointed that Apple didn’t go the extra mile and have the Privacy Report widget display a score or grade for the privacy features of any particular website. That’s what DuckDuckGo’s Safari extension does, and while the user can’t really do anything with that information other than complain or choose not to go to that website ever again, at least it would have some name-and-shame value that might motivate websites to be better citizens.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-translate.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Click to translate in Big Sur. (Also pictured: favicons in tabs.)</figcaption></figure><p>Safari is finally catching up to Google Chrome with the addition of in-place translation across seven languages. Once Safari detects a foreign language, it will display a translation icon in the search bar. Once you’ve clicked to see a translation, any additional pages you visit on that site will automatically load in translation while you’re there. Apple is launching with support for seven languages, including English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>Safari 14 also completely embraces the website favicon in browser tabs. If you don’t remember the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/08/safari_should_display_favicons_in_its_tabs">debate about this feature</a> from back in 2017, the short version is that for ages now Chrome has included a small website icon in its browser tabs, along with the name of the page. Safari didn’t used to show the icon, though it now lets you optionally display it. In Safari 14, favicon display is on by default, and Apple has improved legibility when you’ve got a lot of tabs open by collapsing tiny tabs down to only display the icon. Apple has also added a quick page preview when you hover the pointer over a tab, letting you see what’s there before clicking.</p>
<p>Finally, Apple is adding support for the popular WebExtensions API that’s used by developers to write plug-ins for other browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox. Theoretically, this will allow Safari users to finally take advantage of all of the cool extensions written for those other browsers. But of course, there’s a catch. For an extension to work in Safari, the developer may need to make some changes in order to meet Apple’s security standards. They’ll also need to use Xcode (which means they’ll need to buy a Mac if they don’t own one), and they’ll need to submit their extension to the App Store.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of barriers just to reach Mac users running Safari who could just as easily open a different browser to get that functionality. It feels like the big inducement here is to be ready with Safari extensions for macOS and then rush into iOS and iPadOS the moment Apple supports these extensions on those platforms, too. But if you’ve got a favorite Chrome extension that you’d like to see come to macOS, you may need to write to the developer and try to convince them.</p>
<p>I hope Apple makes this work and Safari gets a much richer extension library out of this, but there’s also a scenario where plug-in developers just don’t bother with Safari. That would be a shame. We’ll see.</p>
<h3>Catalyst moves ahead (at last)</h3>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-catalyst-shadow.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Catalyst date picker isn’t a spinning circle anymore!</figcaption></figure><p>Two years ago, in macOS Mojave, Apple began the migration of iPad apps to the Mac with four stock apps. Last year, Apple opened up the technology used to make that migration possible, Mac Catalyst, to all app developers. The results in the past year have been mixed. While a few interesting apps have come across, it’s been a relatively quiet migration. Developers I’ve talked to have cited the limitations of Catalyst, and expressed hope that it would be improved in Big Sur.</p>
<p>Early indications are that it has been improved quite a bit, and maybe this will finally bring a much larger number of iPad-only apps to the Mac at last. Perhaps one reason for the improvement during this cycle is Apple’s replacement of two prominent Mac apps with new Catalyst versions: Maps and Messages. Apple might’ve been able to sneak by with an iffy implementation of Catalyst for a bunch of apps that hadn’t existed before on the Mac, as was the case with previous Catalyst apps, but with Maps and Messages each feature regression would be an indictment of Catalyst.</p>
<p>So I’m happy to report that my early experience with both apps is good. They feel like Mac apps, albeit with an iPad sort of flavor. Catalyst now supports multiple windows, so you can pop out a chat from Messages into a separate window without any trouble. The date and time pickers are no longer spinning wheels, which was perhaps the most glaring example of Catalyst’s unfinished nature.</p>
<p>And then there’s the upside: Apple’s been adding features to both Maps and Messages over the years—and just <em>not</em> bringing them to macOS. With the move to Catalyst in Big Sur, we finally get access to those features on the Mac. If someone on an iPhone sends you a message with lasers, you will see the lasers. And can respond with balloons. This isn’t just the case where the Mac is getting this year’s Messages improvements (like pinned chats, threading, and mentions)—it’s getting those, and last year’s improvements, and the previous year’s, too. The same is true for Maps, which gets this year’s feature additions like bike directions, but also previous iPad features like street view.</p>
<p>Now, let’s be clear: Getting this version of Messages is only a cause for celebration because Apple essentially abandoned the Mac app for several years. And the same is true, to an extent, to Maps. I don’t want to praise Apple too much for these new apps, because it was shameful that these core system apps (especially Messages) were kept in stasis, buggy and behind the times, for so long. But at least now, they will move in lockstep across Apple’s platforms—and that’s fundamentally good for the Mac.</p>
<p>This is really a glimpse into the future of the Mac, too. Mac Catalyst really exists because Apple doesn’t want to (or can’t afford to) maintain separate apps for the Mac and iPhone/iPad. Now Apple—and any other developer who wants to take advantage of Mac Catalyst—can start looking at the Mac as an additional place for their iOS development work to go. I think in the end this will be a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/07/why-the-mac-is-once-again-central-to-apples-future/">net benefit for the Mac</a>.</p>
<h2>And the rest</h2>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-reminders.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>You can now assign tasks to different people in Reminders.</figcaption></figure><p>There are dozens of other feature additions in Big Sur, and I look forward to spending the rest of the summer investigating them. A few stood out, though.</p>
<p>Reminders gets a bunch of new features, including the ability to assign items to people in a shared list. Photos has improved its Retouch tool to use machine learning, which has the potential to dramatically improve that feature.</p>
<p>And if you use a laptop with Big Sur, you get access to the very nice Battery system preferences panel, which displays some graphs of your battery level and usage in the last 24 hours and 10 days. (Desktop users will instead see the classic Energy Saver panel.)</p>
<p>Apple has revamped the system sounds, both beeps and other sound effects. We went over many of them in <a href="http://relay.fm/upgrade/307">a recent episode of Upgrade</a>, and while some of them are improvements, others feel like real downgrades. I guess we’ll all get used to them.</p>
<p>Of course, perhaps the biggest feature of macOS Big Sur aren’t even really available to the general public yet: support for Macs running Apple silicon rather than Intel. This is the first version of macOS that will support those Macs, when they begin arriving later this fall. I’d imagine that we may see some special macOS features that are only enabled on those systems and that Apple is holding close to its chest in the meantime. (I’m fascinated to see just how the process of downloading iOS apps and running them on a Mac feels, for instance.) But it’s worth remembering that this isn’t just a normal macOS release, but the first release that offers compatibility with an entirely different processor architecture.</p>
<h2>How big is Big Sur?</h2>
<p>It’s still early yet. There are probably months to go before macOS Big Sur makes its way to people who haven’t signed up for beta testing, and there are rough edges here, to be sure.</p>
<p>But overall, I think this is an exciting time to be a Mac user. Yes, Big Sur looks and feels very different from the Mac we’ve all come to know. But that’s part of the excitement. I’m excited that Apple is shaking up the Mac after many years of complacency. If you’re not excited by this, I understand it—and Catalina (and let’s be honest, Mojave) is there for you in the meantime.</p>
<p>I’m happy that the Mac has more life left in it, and Big Sur feels like the start of the next phase. With it, Apple is redefining how we use our Macs and the software on them while preparing for a new generation of Macs running Apple-built processors. If Catalina was a bitter taste of medicine, maybe Big Sur is the reward.</p>

Uri is an artist, designer, inventor, and maker of all trades. One of the things I love most about his projects is that he always incorporates art, whimsy, and a sense of humor into his creations. He makes an optical center punch but carves it into the head of The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper. He turns a machinist’s test indicator into Michelangelo’s hand of God. He shapes a tiny hammer into a whale. In Uri’s world, tools have personality and make you smile as they go about their jobs. If you ask me, the world needs a lot more of this.</p>

<p>Apple has announced that it’s moving the Mac to Apple-designed processors. The design of the iMac is stale and in desperate need of reinvention—just as it was <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/04/2019-imac-review/">last year when Apple updated the iMac</a>. But before the transition to Apple silicon arrives, it’s time for one last hurrah.</p>
<p>The 2020 revision to the 27-inch iMac adds in many (but not all) of the features of the late 2017 iMac Pro. It’s an update with some intriguing options and which addresses some of the iMac line’s most glaring weaknesses. If this is the end of the Intel Mac era, at least it’s going out with a bang.</p>
<p><span id="more-12628"></span></p>
<h2>Forget about the smaller iMac</h2>
<p>This update is all about the 27-inch iMac. The 21.5-inch model, which was already a step behind its big brother (using eighth-generation Intel processors, rather than the ninth-generation processors in the 2019 model 27-inch iMac), hasn’t been updated at all.</p>
<p>The base configurations of both models have been altered to include at least a 256GB solid-state drive for storage, rather than a spinning hard drive. This is a good move. While 256GB of storage isn’t a lot, the speed of an SSD improves the base iMac experience dramatically. Buyers of new iMacs can opt for a 1TB Fusion drive instead for the same price; post-purchase, there are plenty of options out there—including some pretty affordable external SSDs if speed is a priority, and spinning discs if you need a lot of room.</p>
<p>But that all said, I can’t recommend anyone buying the 21.5-inch 4K iMac right now if you can avoid it. Not only is it old, but it’s a prime candidate to be one of the first Macs to get an Apple silicon makeover.</p>
<p>The 27-inch iMac, on the other hand, is <em>much</em> more interesting, and worth serious consideration if you’re in the market for a desktop Mac.</p>
<h2>The big feature</h2>
<p>Now, this review is going to feature all the stuff you’re used to seeing in a computer review. I promise that there will be some bar charts comparing the speed of the new top-of-the-line iMac to my reliable (and, as of this week, discontinued!) 8-core iMac Pro. I’ll detail some of the internal changes made to these iMacs. There’s more here than you might expect.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac-2020-glare.jpg?ssl=1" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This is an approximation of what a reflection (of a floor lamp, right side of the screen) looks like on the nano-texture display. It’s incredibly diffuse.</figcaption></figure><p>But I need to begin with what is probably the single biggest reason people will buy this iMac: As a $500 option, you can trade in the normal glass on the front of the iMac for a glass sheet that’s been etched by Apple to create a glare-killing “nano-texture.” This is the same technique Apple uses to create the $1000 anti-glare option for the Apple Pro Display XDR. It comes with a special cloth you’re supposed to use to clean it. Apple will sell you a replacement cloth for $10 if you lose it.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: It’s <em>spectacular.</em> The nano-texture glass doesn’t stop all light from bouncing off the display and back into your eyes, but it cuts it down and diffuses it remarkably. Unlike so many add-on films and coatings that cut down on glare but make a display feel murky or muddy, the iMac’s display feels unnaturally clear. Even with a window directly behind me, I could see everything on the screen clearly.</p>
<p>If you’re someone who struggles with glare on your monitor, especially if you’re a graphics or video pro for whom every little visual detail matters, you might have sighed at the cost of the Pro Display XDR (let alone the $1000 add-on for the nano-texture). Now it’s here as a $500 option on an iMac. (This is otherwise the same excellent 5K iMac display seen in previous models.) I suspect Apple is going to sell a lot of iMacs just for its nano-texture display.</p>
<h2>Inherited from other Macs</h2>
<p>If this is the last Intel iMac, at least the 2020 27-inch iMac takes advantage of the last few years of Mac progress. (Better late than never!)</p>
<p>Most of these new features spring from the addition of the T2 processor <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3245764/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution.html">introduced with the iMac Pro in 2017</a>. This Apple-designed coprocessor replaces a bunch of other chips and enables all sorts of features, like “Hey Siri,” seamless disk encryption, and even digital signal processing that can dynamically adjust the settings of the iMac’s webcam. (It’s now a 1080 HD camera, by the way, also matching the iMac Pro.)</p>
<p>Though the iMac’s speakers haven’t changed, Apple says that the audio is also processed by the T2, as it is on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. This allows Apple to dynamically adjust EQ settings as volume levels change, which should make quieter volumes still have more audible bass. I am happy to report that the iMac’s speakers do sound very good.</p>
<p>Another feature <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/macbook-pro-16/">picked up from the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is what Apple is calling a “studio quality” microphone. It’s actually three microphones in an array; there are two behind invisible microperforations in the iMac’s aluminum chin, just to the right of the Apple logo, and another one in a visible microperforation on the machine’s back side. The iMac processes the signal from those three microphones and cancels out echo and background noise, improving audio whether you’re creating a song demo in GarageBand or just talking to your colleagues in a videoconference.</p>
<p>I recorded my voice on the new iMac and on my iMac Pro’s built-in microphone, and honestly I think I preferred the recording from the iMac Pro. I’m sure that in certain circumstances these microphones can provide good-enough audio, but I have to admit that I’m a little baffled about how Apple can call them “studio quality,” because I would be quite disappointed if someone sent me an audio file of this quality after a podcast recording session.</p>
<p>This new 27-inch iMac also adds support for TrueTone, which uses a light sensor to automatically match the white point of the iMac’s display to the predominant color temperature of its locale. (And yes, you can turn it off if you don’t want your display’s white point shifting all the time.) And like the Mac mini before it, the 27-inch iMac can now optionally be configured with support for 10-Gigabit Ethernet (which comes standard on the iMac Pro).</p>
<h2>10 generations, 10 cores</h2>
<p>If it’s a last hurrah, the iMac is going out with a bang—the latest and greatest 10th-generation Intel core processors. Most impressive is the fact that the high-end model, which is the one I tested, has ten processor cores. It’s so many cores, in fact, that it’s shamed the old eight-core right out of existence—now the base-model iMac Pro is the ten-core version.</p>
<p>That’s probably a good move, since in my tests, the 10-core i9 iMac configuration beat the pants off of my poor 8-core iMac Pro. Last year’s top-of-the-line iMac beat my iMac Pro at many tests, but the ol’ girl eked out a few wins of her own. This year, it’s no contest.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-imac-chart.png?resize=1172%2C1360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With the addition of so many new features and these powerful new processors, it’s worth asking the question: why pay $4999 for an iMac Pro when you can spend $3299 for an iMac with similar specs?</p>
<p>Well, you probably shouldn’t. But while the iMac Pro may start at 10 cores, it does go up to 18 cores—a configuration that will cost a lot more, but will also deliver greater performance. If you need copious amounts of multi-core performance, the iMac Pro can deliver.</p>
<p>The other reason is, quite simply, the robustness of the iMac Pro cooling system. The iMac’s cooling system, while upgraded somewhat in order to account for the new processors, is still much weaker than the system in the iMac Pro. When running my speed tests for this review, the iMac’s fans spun up immediately and were clearly audible as long as the computer was under load. My iMac Pro, on the other hand, didn’t break a sweat as it silently blew hot air out of its superior cooling system. If fan noise matters to you, the iMac Pro wins hands down. But no nano-texture display for you!</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Should you buy a new Mac when Apple is about to switch up the Mac’s chip architecture? It depends on your worldview. If you want to be on the cutting edge, this new iMac will feel outmoded within months. But if you want a reliable and powerful computer that’s based on well-understood technology that will serve you well for years, this iMac will deliver.</p>
<p>Which leads me to ponder what happens next for the iMac. As I <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html">wrote at Macworld earlier this week</a>, it feels like this 27-inch iMac refresh allows Apple to attend to some other, more needy products in the earliest days of the transition to Apple silicon.</p>
<p>There’s not a Mac more needy than the smaller iMac. Perhaps the little buddy will blaze a trail for its larger sibling to follow. I love the iMac, but it’s wearing a bit thin. It’s time for a regeneration. I hope that this new 27-inch iMac, as impressive as it is, is remembered as the last (and best) of its kind.</p>

<li>As a test, I have literally drop-kicked L&amp;L containers containing wet, oily foods inside, resulting in no leakage whatsoever.</li>
<li>That latter confidence test is why L&amp;L are the only food containers I will carry inside a backpack or carry-on bag. And yes, I usually bring one when I travel for inflight food en route and restaurant leftovers at the destination.</li>
<li>Again, my utterly baseless hypothesis is that all this comes down to a culturally unique use case: Lock &amp; Lock is Korean, and Koreans routinely store and transport wet, fermented, yummy-but-pungent foods like kimchi. Plus it&#8217;s a place where lots of people bring their lunch to work. This necessitates great seals and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<div>So that&#8217;s just basic mechanics. As a lifestyle bonus&#8230;</div>
<ul>
<li>LocknLock also offers containers in a variety of sizes, many of which use the same lid. So in our house, we have lots of different containers with different capacities, but all our lids are the same size. MUCH easier to manage, store, and wrangle.</li>
<li>Likewise, that common size means they stack and store neatly and easily in the refrigerator. (See photo, with wet tofu storage at top left)</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been using some of mine for 5+ years by now, and all of it still functions like new.  Well made!</li>

    <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates">James Vincent at The Verge:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  There are tens of thousands of genes in the human genome: minuscule twists of DNA and RNA that combine to express all of the traits and characteristics that make each of us unique. Each gene is given a name and alphanumeric code, known as a symbol, which scientists use to coordinate research. But over the past year or so, some 27 human genes have been renamed, all because Microsoft Excel kept misreading their symbols as dates.</p>
<p>  The problem isn’t as unexpected as it first sounds. Excel is a behemoth in the spreadsheet world and is regularly used by scientists to track their work and even conduct clinical trials. But its default settings were designed with more mundane applications in mind, so when a user inputs a gene’s alphanumeric symbol into a spreadsheet, like MARCH1 — short for “Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1” — Excel converts that into a date: 1-Mar.

    <p id="p1">Today Samuel Axon at ArsTechnica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a new interview</a> with two Apple executives: SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea and VP of Product Marketing Bob Borchers. The interview is lengthy yet well worth reading, especially since it&rsquo;s the most we&rsquo;ve heard from Apple&rsquo;s head of ML and AI since he departed Google to join the company in 2018.</p>
<p id="p2">Based on some of the things Giannandrea says in the interview, it sounds like he&rsquo;s had a very busy two years. For example, when asked to list ways Apple has used machine learning in its recent software and products, Giannandrea lists a variety of things before ultimately indicating that it&rsquo;s harder to name things that don&rsquo;t use machine learning than ones that do.</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of new experiences that are powered by machine learning. And these are things like language translation, or on-device dictation, or our new features around health, like sleep and hand washing, and stuff we&rsquo;ve released in the past around heart health and things like this. I think there are increasingly fewer and fewer places in iOS where we&rsquo;re not using machine learning. It&rsquo;s hard to find a part of the experience where you&rsquo;re not doing some predictive [work].
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">One interesting tidbit mentioned by both Giannandrea and Borchers is that Apple&rsquo;s increased dependence on machine learning hasn&rsquo;t led to the company talking about ML non-stop. I&rsquo;ve noticed this too &ndash; whereas a few years ago the company might have thrown out &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; countless times during a keynote presentation, these days it&rsquo;s intentionally more careful and calculated in naming the term, and I think for good reason. As Giannandrea puts it, &ldquo;I think that this is the future of the computing devices that we have, is that they be smart, and that, that smart sort of disappear.&rdquo; Borchers expounds on that idea:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  This is clearly our approach, with everything that we do, which is, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s focus on what the benefit is, not how you got there.&rsquo; And in the best cases, it becomes automagic. It disappears&hellip; and you just focus on what happened, as opposed to how it happened.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">The full interview covers subjects like Apple&rsquo;s Neural Engine, Apple Silicon for Macs, the benefits of handling ML tasks on-device, and much more, including a fun story from Giannandrea&rsquo;s early days at Apple.

    <p>The Verge’s Tom Warren reports on the latest casualty of Apple’s App Store policies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released">Microsoft’s forthcoming cloud gaming system</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Our Project xCloud preview TestFlight period has ended on iOS and we are focused on delivering cloud gaming as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to Android customers beginning September 15,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “It’s our ambition to scale cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass available on all devices.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is disappointing, to say the least. I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/project_xcloud_preview_impressions_more_than_playable_less_than_perfect/">took a look at the xCloud preview back in February</a> and found it passable, if not amazing, but I was hopeful that its continued development would see it becoming a more refined product.</p>
<p>That seems not to be, at least in the short term. The Verge’s piece cites a number of App Store rules that may be standing in the way of xCloud’s launch on iOS and iPadOS, including the onerous restrictions on in-app purchase and limits on “remote desktop clients.”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Microsoft also has a console streaming option that’s distinct from xCloud; instead of streaming games from the cloud, users can stream titles from the Xbox in their house to their mobile device. But unlike the cloud gaming system, that option never even made it to a beta test for iOS/iPadOS devices (though there are third-party options that do seem to allow it).</p>
<p>Steam Link, Valve’s app for streaming games from PC to mobile devices, did end up available on iOS and tvOS after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released">a year-long process</a>, so on the one hand this doesn’t bode well for Microsoft or Xbox owners—but, on the other hand, one hopes that perhaps Apple may have learned something from that process.</p>
<p>Game streaming’s not going anywhere, and this only adds to the mounting pressure on the App Store, for which Apple most recently found itself brought before congress to answer questions about anticompetitive behavior. Only now, it’s not just developers who are finding themselves frustrated by the strictures in place, but consumers as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356274/microsoft-xcloud-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-testing-ends-apple-app-store-policies">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/microsoft-ends-cloud-streaming-beta-for-ios-preps-android-only-launch/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

<p class="">Spam folders are great—until they are not. If your email client/service decides to start throwing important email into the spam folder, then you’ve got trouble. I had that happen with some customer support emails a few months ago. So I went looking for way to stop an overly aggressive spam filter from upsetting customers without giving up on spam filters entirely.</p><p class="">The solution was with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sanebox.com/coupon/9315356da7" target="_blank"><span>this week’s sponsor, SaneBox</span></a>. SaneBox adds a pile of email features to your email, no matter what email service you use or what email app you choose. One of those features is the SaneNotSpam folder.</p>

    <p>Sam Byford, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Google Store has sold through its inventory and completed sales of Pixel 4 [and] 4 XL,” a Google spokesperson confirms to The Verge. “For people who are still interested in buying Pixel 4 [and] 4 XL, the product is available from some partners while supplies last. Just like all Pixel devices, Pixel 4 will continue to get software and security updates for at least three years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US.”</p>

<p>It’s unusual for Google to discontinue a Pixel phone so quickly. The Pixels 2 and 3 were on sale for around 18 months each, with Google stopping sales roughly six months after the introduction of their successors. The move means Google technically no longer has a flagship phone for sale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’m crazy for thinking Google has lost interest in Android.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 5. Note that the US number increased quite a bit from yesterday. This is because Johns Hopkins incorporated the increased count from New Jersey and I followed along. However, that affects only the cumulative total, not the trendline of the past few weeks. The raw data from Johns Hopkins is <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv">here.</a></p>

    <p>Interesting interview (and, I think, perhaps the first major one) with Apple senior vice president for machine learning and AI strategy, John Giannandrea, along with product marketing VP Bob Borchers, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/">by Ars Technica’s Samuel Axon</a>. One tidbit that I hadn’t heard elsewhere: Giannandrea actually drove the development of the handwriting features in iPadOS 14:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When I joined Apple, I was already an iPad user, and I loved the Pencil,” Giannandrea (who goes by “J.G.” to colleagues) told me. “So, I would track down the software teams and I would say, ‘Okay, where’s the machine learning team that’s working on handwriting?’ And I couldn’t find it.” It turned out the team he was looking for didn’t exist—a surprise, he said, given that machine learning is one of the best tools available for the feature today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot packed in here, from Apple’s feelings about on-device processing of data to the company’s view on privacy, to even the threats—or lack thereof—of machine learning and AI. Well worth a read, as this technology becomes more and more essential to Apple devices. And, as the interview points out, with Macs about to make the jump to Apple silicon, expect even more powerful machine learning-based features in macOS going forward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apples-ai-chief-on-the-critical-nature-of-machine-learning-in-the-companys-products/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>This post looks at an algorithm by Cohen et al [1] to accelerate the convergence of an alternating series. This method is much more efficient than the classical Euler–Van Wijngaarden method.</p>
<p>For our example, we&#8217;ll look at the series</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/cohen_example.svg" alt="\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2}" width="75" height="49" /></p>
<p>which converges slowly to -π²/12.</p>
<p>The first algorithm in [1] for approximating</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/alternating_sum.svg" alt="\sum_{k = 1}^\infty (-1)^k a_k" width="86" height="49" /></p>
<p>using up to the <em>n</em>th term is given by the following Python code.</p>
<pre>    def cohen_sum(a, n):
        d = (3 + 8**0.5)**n
        d = (d + 1/d)/2
        b = -1
        c = -d
        s = 0
        for k in range(n):
            c = b - c
            s += c*a[k]
            b = (k+n)*(k-n)*b/((k + 0.5)*(k+1))
    return s/d
</pre>
<p>Two notes: First, the algorithm assumes the index of summation starts at zero and so we&#8217;ll shift our sum to start at zero. We could just define the first term of the sum to be zero and leave the rest of the series alone, but this would produce worse results; it leads to an initial jump in the series that makes the extrapolation in the method less effective. Second, the alternating term (-1)<sup><em>k</em></sup> is not part of the array passed into the function.</p>
<p>Two graphs, especially the second, will illustrate how well the method of Cohen et al performs compared to the direct method of simply taking partial sums. First, here are the sequence of approximations to the final sum on a linear scale.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/cohensumplot3.svg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>And here are the errors in the two methods, plotted on a log scale.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/cohensumplot4.svg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>The error from using the direct method of computing partial sums is on the order of 1/<em>n</em>² while the error from using the accelerated method is roughly 1/20.7<sup><em>n</em></sup>. In this example, it would take around 30,000 terms for the direct method to achieve the accuracy that the accelerated method achieves with 10 terms.</p>
<p>Note that accelerating convergence can be a delicate affair. Different acceleration methods are appropriate for different sums, and applying the wrong method to the wrong series can actually slow convergence as illustrated <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/08/01/accelerating-an-alternating-series/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Recently I ran into issues trying to install new rubies with <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>. All of my errors centered around <code>openssl</code>, and they took me a fair amount of time to resolve. So I’m putting this up mostly as notes to myself and hopefully to help anyone else who runs into this.</p>

<p>Homebrew (fairly) recently updated the <code>openssl</code> formula to 1.1. RVM (and some random daemons on my machine) require <code>openssl</code> 1.0 to compile/install older rubies. In fact, I was running into issues even trying to install Ruby 2.6.5. Manually trying to install <code>openssl</code> 1.0 didn’t work for me, nor did a dozen other solutions I tried. Here’s the magic formula that worked:</p>

<pre><code>brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies
brew tap-new $USER/old-openssl
brew extract --version=1.0.2t openssl $USER/old-openssl
brew install openssl@1.0.2t
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a “tap” for the older version of OpenSSL so you can install it with Homebrew. Once this is all working, you can actually install v1.0 next to it and with the right path settings, use them both as needed.</p>

<p>The secret to getting RVM to use the right version is <code>pkg_config</code>. By setting the path to the <code>openssl</code> 1.0 version of this in the <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable, you can get rvm to install using the older libraries. Here’s the incantation (using Bash):</p>

<pre><code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0.2t/lib/pkgconfig \
rvm install 2.6.5 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0.2t
</code></pre>

<p>Credit for this goes to <a href="https://mentalized.net/journal/2019/09/13/ruby-2-3-rvm-and-openssl-1-0/">Jakob Skjerning</a>.</p>

<p>Like I said, once this is working you can just <code>brew install openssl</code> to get an up-to-date version installed, leaving the 1.0 version in place. When you need to use it, you can just apply the paths needed and everything else will continue using 1.1+.</p>

<p>Hope that helps someone (and probably future me).</p>

    <p>Molly Hensley-Clancy and Caroline O’Donovan, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind a <a href="https://twitter.com/Freeyourmindkid/status/1290626349426671617">viral photo</a> of a crowded hallway at a high school in
Georgia, a potentially dire situation is brewing. Students,
teachers, and parents fear the Paulding County school’s rushed
reopening plans may be spiraling out of control just two days
after students — who said they were told they could face
expulsion for remaining home — returned to class despite reports
of positive coronavirus cases among students and staff. […]</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html">recommendations from CDC health officials</a>, the
district has called mask-wearing a “personal choice” and said
that social distancing “will not be possible to enforce” in “most
cases.” While the school provided teachers with face shields and
masks and encouraged staff and students to wear them, they are
not required and not all teachers have chosen to use them. One
North Paulding teacher resigned last month over concerns about
virus safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>School or death cult, you make the call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Wednesday, the school addressed the controversy that had
swirled around the viral photograph via an intercom announcement
from North Paulding High School principal Gabe Carmona. In it,
according to two people familiar with the situation, he stated
that any student found criticizing the school on social media
could face disciplinary consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that will certainly keep everyone healthy, and will teach the kids an important lesson on their First Amendment rights at the same time.</p>

    <p>Heather Kelly, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Team Trump’s tweet of a video clip from a Fox News interview — in
which President Trump said that children are “almost immune” from
COVID-19 — violates the site’s rules against misinformation, the
company said. Twitter hid the post and said the account will not
be able to tweet again until he deletes it, although it can appeal
the decision.</p>

<p>Twitter spokeswoman Liz Kelley said the tweet “is in violation of
the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation. The account owner
will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again.”</p>

<p>Facebook on Wednesday said it removed President Trump’s post of a
video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said that
children are “almost immune” from COVID-19, marking the company’s
increasingly tough stance on political speech amid heightened
pressure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worth emphasizing that this was the “Team Trump” campaign account, not Trump’s personal account, but still. It is bad enough that we’re caught in a nationwide quagmire over whether Facebook and Twitter should allow the president of the United States to shitpost lies, period. But lies that are resulting in schools opening to comply with Trump’s fantasy  that schools should open in areas where COVID-19 transmission is out of control are so far over the line, you can’t even see the line from there.</p>

    <p>The Lagrange inversion formula can be used to find the power series for the inverse of a function. I wrote about a different approach this problem <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/02/24/invert-power-series/">a couple years ago</a>, that time using Bell polynomials. This time I&#8217;ll give a formula that is more direct and easier to remember.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a function <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) and can compute its derivatives. We want to find a power series for <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>) where <em>B</em>(<em>A</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>x</em>. We assume <em>A</em>(0) = 0 and <em>A</em>&#8216;(0) ≠ 0.</p>
<p>The <em>k</em>th coefficient in the power series for B(<em>x</em>) is given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif1.svg" alt="b_k = \frac{1}{k} [k-1] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k" width="179" height="47" /></p>
<p>where [<em>k</em> &#8211; 1] in front of a function means to take the (<em>k</em>-1)st coefficient in its power series.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s apply this to get the first few terms of the series for tangent. Since inverse tangent has a simpler power series than tangent, we&#8217;ll set <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) = arctan(<em>x</em>) so that <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>) is tangent, i.e. the inverse of the inverse tangent.</p>
<p>Of course we could just find the power series for tangent directly, and this is just a demonstration. Power series inversion is more useful when you can&#8217;t simply find the series for the inverse function directly.</p>
<p>We will compute the coefficients <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>3</sub>, and <em>b</em><sub>5</sub> to get a 5th order series for tangent. Why don&#8217;t we need to compute <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>4</sub>? Because tangent is an odd function, we know that its power series coefficients with even indices are zero.</p>
<p>(You can see that this happens in general by looking at the equation above. If <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) is an odd function, then <em>x</em> / <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) is even, and so are its <em>k</em>th powers. The coefficients with odd index in the power series for an even function are zero.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif2.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^1 &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{3}x^2 - \frac{1}{45}x^4 + \cdots \\ \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^3 &amp;= 1 + \phantom{\frac{1}{3}}x^2 + \frac{1}{15}x^4 + \cdots \\ \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^5 &amp;= 1 + \frac{5}{3}x^2 + \frac{2}{15}x^4 + \cdots \end{align*}" width="295" height="151" /></p>
<p>So <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> equals the 0th coefficient in the power series for <em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>), which is 1.</p>
<p>Next <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> equals 1/3 times the 2nd coefficient in the power series for (<em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>))<sup>3</sup>, and so <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> = 1/3.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>b</em><sub>5</sub> equals 1/5 times the 4th coefficient in the power series for (<em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>))<sup>5</sup>, and so <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> = 2/15.</p>
<p>This tells us the power series for tangent is given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif3.svg" alt="\tan(x) = x + \frac{1}{3} x^3 + \frac{2}{15}x^5 + \cdots" width="236" height="37" /></p>
<p>and we could check by computing the power series directly that these terms are correct.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we can extend the formula at the top of this post to include powers of the inverse function. That is, the coefficients in the power series for <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> are given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif4.svg" alt=" [k] ((B(x)^n) = \frac{n}{k} [k-n] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k [k] ((B(x)^n) = \frac{n}{k} [k-n] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k" width="259" height="47" /></p>
<p>which reduces to the formula up top when <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
