    <p>Russell Brandom, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday, Epic Games and Apple faced off in the first hearing of
their ongoing legal fight, held in a public Zoom call because of
the ongoing quarantine restrictions. The hearing sought to
determine whether Epic’s developer privileges should be legally
protected — initially by a temporary restraining order, setting
the stage for a more powerful preliminary injunction that would
remain in force for the duration of the trial.</p>

<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not issue an immediate ruling on
the issue, but said she would be issuing a written order after the
fact “and I will issue it quickly.”</p>

<p>However, Judge Rogers opened the hearing by indicating she was
likely to take action to protect the Unreal Engine, but let the
Fortnite ban stand. “I am not inclined to grant relief with
respect to the games,” the judge said, “but I am inclined to grant
relief with respect to the Unreal Engine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effectively, Apple’s threat to revoke all of Epic’s Apple Developer Program memberships — not just the account for the subsidiary behind Fortnite but also that of the subsidiary behind Unreal Engine — has made this into two cases: the main part regarding Fortnite and the iOS App Store, and a second part regarding Unreal Engine and all Apple platforms.</p>

<p>Judge Rogers’s take sounds right for now: in Apple’s favor regarding Fortnite, and in Epic’s favor regarding Unreal Engine.</p>

<p>For good play-by-play livestream coverage of the hearing, I suggest reading <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/1298020443182440449">Sarah Jeong’s thread on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/48/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Judge Rogers ruled exactly as she was inclined</a>. Seems fair, and the ruling’s “background” section is an excellent, accurate, and fair assessment of the saga to date.</p>

    <p>Regarding the Unreal Engine part of the Epic v. Apple legal battle, Microsoft Xbox executive Kevin Gammill filed a declaration for Epic over the weekend. I’m a little surprised Microsoft waded into this at all, but read Gammill’s declaration — it’s only three pages and very cogent. All his declaration states is that Apple revoking Epic’s license to develop Unreal Engine for Apple platforms would be bad for Epic and bad for all games that use Unreal Engine to target iOS or MacOS. Basically: duh. It doesn’t even contain the terms “Fortnite” or “App Store”.</p>

<p>This doesn’t contradict <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/sweeney_hand_waving_game_consoles_app_stores">my prediction</a> that you won’t see Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo file amicus briefs on Epic’s behalf about the App Store’s control over software and mandatory use Apple’s payment system. If Apple hadn’t threatened to revoke the developer program license for Unreal Engine, Microsoft wouldn’t have piped in here.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Henrique Prange, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop using 6-digit iPhone passcodes! Do you think I am overly
paranoid? Keep reading.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of mine had his iPhone stolen. What follows
is the sequence of events that started as an unfortunate event
and ended up with $30,000 in unauthorized wire transfers, $2,500
spent on the AppStore, and accounts of multiple services
compromised. […]</p>

<p>So, how could the wrongdoers do all of that in less than 5 hours?
After considering many options, the only reasonable explanation is
they cracked the 6-digit passcode on the stolen iPhone using some
kind of device like the GrayKey.</p>

<p>The passcode gave them access to the keychain. They searched for
the iCloud credentials, disabled the Lost Mode, and turned off the
Find My.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting but alarming story. Did the thieves crack his 6-digit passcode with a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/graykey">GrayKey</a> or GrayKey-like device? Impossible to say. But it’s worth thinking about it. We know GrayKey exists, and if it exists, thieves could have it. It’s also easier for a would-be thief to snoop a target entering a 6-digit passcode than an alphanumeric passphrase.</p>

<p>I mention this in the wake of the aforelinked piece on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/24/face-id-vs-face-masks">Face ID vs. face masks</a> because months ago, when I first started grocery shopping while wearing a mask, I switched my iPhone from an alphanumeric passphrase back to a 6-digit passcode for convenience. I did so thinking, basically, that even though a 6-digit passcode is less secure, anything truly dangerous like disabling Find My iPhone requires my iCloud password as well.</p>

<p>It simply never occurred to me that if a thief (or law enforcement, or any adversary) has the device passcode, and your iCloud password is in your keychain, they can get your iCloud password from your keychain. All you need is the device passcode to access <em>all</em> of the passwords in iCloud keychain. Try it — you can.</p>

<p>So I’m back on an alphanumeric passphrase, inconvenience while wearing a mask be damned. Remember too: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/20/how-modern-iphone-encryption-works">you don’t need to make an alphanumeric device passphrase long or complicated to make it very secure</a> — a 6-character alphanumeric passphrase would take on average 72 years to crack by brute force because it takes 80-milliseconds for the secure enclave to process each guess.</p>

<p>Republican convention starts tonight.</p>
<p><em>Tell us something we don’t know, Lance.</em></p>
<p>Ok. Let me tell you this...</p>
<p>Don’t watch.</p>
<p>Unless you’re being paid to, give the whole four nights the skip.</p>
<p>Don’t follow it on Twitter either. There’s no point. And it won’t do you any good. Republicans don’t care what we think. They like it when we sputter in outrage and dismay. And you’ll only be helping him. You’ll be telling the networks there’s money in covering him as if he’s a regular Presidential candidate with your impressions, clicks, and eyeballs. You’ll be adding to his ratings, and you know important those are to him. He’ll lie and brag no matter what, but at least you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you didn’t contribute. And he wins by getting into your head and poisoning your soul. If all you’re going to do is tweet your anger and fear, paranoia and despair, you’re doing his work for him.</p>
<p>Watch a movie. Watch basketball. Binge watch a TV show. Read a book. Write some letters. Talk to friends and relations in person, if you can, by phone or on whatever device that’s handiest for you. Take a long walk, if you can. If you can, sit outside and look at the stars. If you have any left, shoot off some fireworks, although I and your neighbors really wish you wouldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>If romance is a possibility, make it a night of romance. Throw yourself a party, even if it has to be a party of one.</p>
<p>If you can’t resist the lure of social media, remember that most people online aren’t here to obsess over politics and there’s lots going on that’s interesting, informative, and fun. Like on my blog. I don&#39;t write just about politics, you know. <a href="https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fer inskinks.</a></p>
<p>If you can&#39;t help yourself, whatever you do, don&#39;t watch it on one of the major networks or follow it via their newsfeeds. They&#39;re going to &quot;report&quot; on it and &quot;analyze&quot; it as if it&#39;s not all lies in service of re-electing a criminal lunatic , proven incompetent, and unabashed racist president. C-SPAN, MSNBC, and Amazon Prime are showing it whole without cutting away to give it over to the bobbleheads so they can blather. But better for your heart, soul, and sanity not to bother at all.</p>
<p>With that said, however, if you have to, absolutely have to, watch a convention, re-watch ours. All four days along with selected highlights are still <a href="https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available for streaming at the DNC’s website.</a> We had a good one, a joy-filled one, and had a better time than they’re going to have.</p>
<p><em>Photo up top was taken the other day by your faithful correspondent. The big baby&#39;s crib is on a street close to Uncle Merlin&#39;s boyhood home. Up and down the street and up and down most of the steets in town are Black Lives Matter signs and houses with rainbow flags and Biden-Harris signs that have sprung up seemingly overnight, replacing the Biden 2020 signs that had been there since February. What can I tell you. It&#39;s a Democratic town. Except for the house three doors down from Baby Trump. They&#39;re flying a Gadsden flag. A faded one. The neighbors probably do their best to ignore it.</em></p>

    <p>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge two weeks ago (or yesterday, in coronatime):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Microsoft had revealed the design of the Surface Duo back in
October, the company has kept the specs relatively secret. The
device includes two separate 5.6-inch OLED displays (1800 x 1350)
with a 4:3 aspect ratio that connect together to form a 8.1-inch
overall workspace (2700 x 1800) with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Unlike
foldables like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, the Surface Duo is using
real Gorilla Glass, and the displays are designed to work in a
similar way to multiple monitors on a Windows PC.</p>

<p>One big question over the Surface Duo has been the camera.
Microsoft is using an 11-megapixel f/2.0 camera, which will
include auto modes for low light, HDR multi-frame captures, and a
“super zoom” up to 7x. Both 4K and 1080p video recording will be
supported at 30fps and 60fps, with electronic image stabilization.
There’s only a single camera on the Surface Duo, which can be used
both for video calls and as a main camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I’m deeply intrigued by the Surface Duo but at the same time incredibly dubious that anyone wants this. I don’t get the confusion over whether it’s a phone or not. It can make phone calls and act as a phone, but Microsoft never calls it one. My take is it’s a folding tablet that might as well act like a phone if you have a cellular plan, in case that’s what you really want. But I’d guess most people who do get one of these will still carry a dedicated phone — I’ve been skeptical about giant ass phones for a decade now and I’ve been proven largely wrong (no pun intended) about the size of phones many people want to carry, but this is preposterous as something you might want to pocket.</p>

<p>People are dinging it for the broad bezels at the top and bottom but that’s just superficial. My fundamental skepticism is whether Android is actually a good OS for this, and whether there are actual use cases for this form factor regardless of OS and application support for the split screen. At $1,400 it’s clearly a premium product — is there a premium use case?</p>

    <p>Election Day is only a couple of months away, and a friend brings to my attention <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/">a new poll from Pew Research:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861378"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 350px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861378" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_pew_2020_important_issues.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="1752"></figure>
<p>This seems relatively unsurprising except for one thing: violent crime. Why is that #5? A followup chart explains it:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861379"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 450px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861379" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_pew_2020_important_issues_comparison.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="1457"></figure>
<p>Among Trump voters, violent crime is #2 behind perennial favorite &#8220;the economy.&#8221; Why? Because Fox News and the rest of the gang have spent the past few months screaming about cities in flame, BLM &#8220;riots,&#8221; and crime capitals of the world. In fact, though, the best evidence we have suggests that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/upshot/murders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html">overall crime is <em>down</em> so far this year.</a> So is overall violent crime. The only thing that&#8217;s up is homicides. Through the first half of the year, there have been a few hundred more than in 2019.</p>
<p>Now, a spike in murders is no small thing. There&#8217;s something going on there, and we don&#8217;t know what it is. Still, those few hundred additional homicides are dwarfed by a drop in other violent crimes that measures in the thousands. And property crimes are down by tens of thousands. Generally speaking, you&#8217;re likely to be considerably safer in a big city than you were last year.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the broader fact that Democrats and Republicans simply care about different things. Here&#8217;s the Pew data arranged by the issues most important to Democrats and Republicans:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861392"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1264px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861392" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_top_issues_republicans.gif" alt="" width="1264" height="629"></figure>
<figure id="attachment_861393"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1264px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861393" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_top_issues_democrats.gif" alt="" width="1264" height="630"></figure>
<p>Republicans care about crime, immigration, and guns. Democrats barely even notice these issues. Conversely, Dems care about the pandemic, race inequality, and climate change. Republicans could care less about them. We are living in two different worlds.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00962ED2V01Y201910CAC049"><p>Many modern computer systems, including homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures, support shared memory in hardware. In a shared memory system, each of the processor cores may read and write to a single shared address space. For a shared memory machine, the memory consistency model defines the architecturally visible behavior of its memory system. Consistency definitions provide rules about loads and stores (or memory reads and writes) and how they act upon memory. As part of supporting a memory consistency model, many machines also provide cache coherence protocols that ensure that multiple cached copies of data are kept up-to-date. The goal of this primer is to provide readers with a basic understanding of consistency and coherence. This understanding includes both the issues that must be solved as well as a variety of solutions. We present both high-level concepts as well as specific, concrete examples from real-world systems.</p>
<p>This second edition reflects a decade of advancements since the first edition and includes, among other more modest changes, two new chapters: one on consistency and coherence for non-CPU accelerators (with a focus on GPUs) and one that points to formal work and tools on consistency and coherence.</p></blockquote>

    <p><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/20/sciadv.abc5961">Noam Shental et al.</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/benadida/status/1297234596342325249">Ben Adida</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/20/sciadv.abc5961"><p>Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic and that significant viral shedding may occur prior to symptom onset. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities to prevent disease spread. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing which identifies all positive subjects within a large set of samples using a single round of testing. Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing carrier detection. In our current study we pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools providing both an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency, as well as an 8-fold reduction in test costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like error correction codes and has similar limitations based on the frequency of errors/infections:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/20/sciadv.abc5961">
<p>Our current implementation of P-BEST was designed for a carrier rate of ~1%. To allow higher testing efficiency, i.e., to minimize the number of pools required to screen a given population, designs should vary according to the carrier rate. Pooling designs can differ by the number of pools, and by the number of samples per pool. Specifically, as the carrier rate in the population rises more pools are required to correctly identify all positive carriers in a single testing round. Moreover, the required number of samples per pool decreases with increasing the carrier rate. Conversely, when carrier rates are low, more efficient pooling designs can be used, i.e., less pools are required to test the same number of individuals, while the number of samples per pool should be increased.</p></blockquote>

<p>And restoring an iCloud backup is problematic because you can&rsquo;t just restore one app. Restoring your Lightroom data would also revert newer data from other apps. Maybe you could restore to a different iOS device and let Lightroom sync the restored photos to the cloud, hoping that none of you other apps upload old data to the cloud.</p>

<p>On the developer side, <em>moving</em> to subscriptions can be a gate to hell. They usually make <em>less</em> at first. Incidentally the first year you pay the higher fee.

The technology is there. It will cost you: users. And angry users don&rsquo;t just leave, they rate you angrily and write angry comments. They feel harmed and they try to harm you as much as possible. Anonymous ratings, upvoting, and reviews make revenge fast, easy, and cheap.</p>

<p>Apple is more likely to help, feature, and support a popular app if it has a subscription. Apple will still show interest in your future if you sell a lot of apps. If there is no subscription planned, Apple&rsquo;s interest vanishes in circles. They come back, showing interest in a featuring here and there, asking questions about your future, and if your response is &ldquo;no subscriptions&rdquo; or &ldquo;no subscriptions only&rdquo; their interest evaporates. Until they don&rsquo;t ask anymore.</p>

<p>We tried high prices, mid-range prices, low prices, free, and freemium. Getting Android users to pay for software is not for the feeble-hearted.

    <p>Hey, remember the poolboy who somehow got an investment from Jerry Falwell Jr. a few years ago for a vaguely defined venture involving a youth hostel? His name is Giancarlo Granda and he now says that ever since he was 20 years old he&#8217;s been having an affair with Falwell&#8217;s wife, Becki. But was it really an &#8220;affair&#8221;? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/08/24/us/politics/24reuters-usa-falwell-relationship-exclusive.html?searchResultPosition=1">According to Granda,</a> “Becki and I developed an intimate relationship and Jerry enjoyed watching from the corner of the room.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the Bible doesn&#8217;t condone this sort of thing, but I don&#8217;t really care. This isn&#8217;t a porn blog, it&#8217;s a politics blog.¹ So I&#8217;m mostly curious about what Republicans think of all this. Here&#8217;s Ari Fleischer, formerly one of George Bush&#8217;s press secretaries:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Prediction: The MSM, including NYT reporters on Twitter, will give this story more coverage than Tara Reade’s accusations against Joe Biden. Because that’s the way it works. Accuse a conservative: Get media attention. Accuse a Democrat: The press needs to think about it. <a href="https://t.co/bhYz6k16aC">https://t.co/bhYz6k16aC</a></p>
<p>— Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/1297939913103548417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Huh. My recollection is that Tara Reade got a mountain of coverage even though her accusations were pretty thin. To find the Falwell story, on the other hand, I had to search the <em>New York Times</em> site because it was nowhere on the front page.</p>
<p>That may change, of course, but my best guess is that the <em>Times</em> and other outlets will give this pretty low-key coverage, though everyone will inevitably finish things up with a 10,000 word, multiple-reporter, graphic-filled feature explaining the entire history of the Falwell clan. (The <em>New Yorker</em> will do 20,000 words.)</p>
<p>That said, how about some actual denunciation of Falwell? I may not care much if Jerry Jr. likes to watch, but supposedly conservatives do. So let&#8217;s hear it. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/24/21348295/rnc-2020-trump-stuart-stevens-it-was-all-a-lie">Or is Stuart Stevens right?</a></p>
<p>¹Yes, yes, I know: that&#8217;s a thin distinction sometimes.</p>

&#8220;One thing about a lot of pocket tools and multi tools is they often have a pretty crappy Phillips head screwdriver. The titanium pocket bit from Big Idea really solves that. It is a key chain based pocket bit or screwdriver bit that has a Phillips head on one side and a regular flathead on the other side. You can take the entire set of your keys and hold it almost like a handle, use the screwdriver, and have a lot of leverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other nice thing is that it comes in to two different packages a round and a hex. If you have the hex bit you can actually use it within some kind of a driver loop and have a lot of torque. I love it. Again, totally titanium so adds no extra weight really to my keys are nothing noticeable and it&#8217;s really a great bit of kit.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From a CBS News survey of over 2,000 registered voters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number of U.S. deaths from coronavirus has been been acceptable /
unacceptable:</p>

<p>Republicans: 57% / 43% <br />
Democrats: 10% / 90% <br />
Independents: 33% / 67%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. has over 176,000 deaths, and that number is growing by around 1,000 per day. According to the same poll, 73 percent of Republicans think the U.S. response to coronavirus is “going well”. This isn’t cult<em>ish</em> — it’s a cult. Either a majority of Republicans are sociopaths or they’re so ignorant they have no idea how much worse the U.S. has handled COVID-19 than other industrialized nations. <a href="https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/1297580905851236354">Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas, on COVID-19 deaths reported yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Italy: 3 <br />
France: 9 <br />
Japan: 14 <br />
Canada: 7 <br />
UK: 18 <br />
Germany: 3  </p>

<p>United States: 974</p>

<p>Population of countries above: 439 million <br />
Population of United States: 328 million</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s almost <em>over</em> for other nations. Here in the U.S. COVID-19 is rampaging.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>This is one of my pet peeves, so I beg your indulgence. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-economy-is-bouncing-backand-gaining-ground-on-the-u-s-11598280917?mod=hp_lead_pos10">This is from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> today:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the rest of the world struggles to contain the coronavirus, China’s recovery is gaining momentum, positioning it to further close its gap with the U.S. economy&#8230;.That bounceback, while far from China’s heady expansions of past years, <strong>should nonetheless help the world’s No. 2 economy move faster in catching up with the U.S.,</strong> which could shrink by as much as 8.0% in 2020.</p>
<p>It is also buttressing Beijing’s belief that China’s state-led model, which helped the country navigate the 2008-09 financial crisis with minimal pain, <strong>is better than the U.S.’s market system,</strong> emboldening Chinese leaders at a time of rising geopolitical competition with the U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s common practice to say that China&#8217;s economy is #2 in the world, or perhaps even #1 depending on how you do your currency conversions. And it&#8217;s true that China&#8217;s GDP is about $15 trillion compared to America&#8217;s $20 trillion. That&#8217;s pretty close, and China is growing faster. Eventually they&#8217;ll catch up.</p>
<p>But who cares? It&#8217;s like bragging that California has more hospitals than Oregon. Of course it does. California has ten times as many people. In the case of China, what matters is GDP per person, and on that score China is light years behind the US. Here&#8217;s the chart you knew was coming:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861291"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1270px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861291" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_china_gdp_per_capita.gif" alt="" width="1270" height="634"></figure>
<p>China&#8217;s GDP per person is about $10,000, compared to $65,000 in the United States. They aren&#8217;t even in the same ballpark, and it will be decades before they catch up to us—if they ever do.</p>
<p>There are obviously some legitimate reasons to look at overall GDP since it affects things like trade volume and military capacity, but most of the time it seems to be little more than an attempt at drama. For some reason we&#8217;re supposed to be afraid that China is going to take over the world, but that looks pretty ridiculous if you look at living standards and GDP per capita. So instead we&#8217;re spoon-fed total GDP, even though we almost never do that for any other country. Do you have any idea how Germany&#8217;s GDP compares to ours? Or Spain&#8217;s? Or Denmark&#8217;s? Here&#8217;s a hint: they&#8217;re a lot lower because they have a fraction of our population.¹ Everyone knows it would be a ridiculous comparison, which is why you never see it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to China, we hear about it all the time. We should knock it off.</p>
<p>¹For the record, roughly $4 trillion, $1 trillion, and $0.3 trillion. Does this tell you anything interesting at all?</p>

    <p>25 years ago, Windows 95 was released to great fanfare.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/win95-rotated.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="Windows 95 MacUser cover" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The magazine I worked at back then, <em>MacUser</em>, decided to offer up as a rejoinder a cover that said “Windows 95: So What?” It was originally intended to feature the Windows logo instead of “Windows 95” in type inside a big yellow circle, but the corporate lawyers intervened and said we couldn’t use the logo on our cover. (I always figured that the lawyers were just an excuse, and that our owner didn’t want to overly antagonize Microsoft, since Ziff-Davis also published both PC Magazine and PC/Computing magazine.)</p>
<p>Here’s the truth about Windows 95, though: it was devastating to the Mac. Before Windows 95, PCs were spectacularly bad. (Sorry, fans of Windows 3.1, but it was garbage.) Windows 95, on the other hand, lifted an enormous amount of features from the Mac and drastically improved usability. Long filenames, trash can, aliases, a desktop, easy app switching, the promise of plug-and-play peripherals—these are all things the Mac had and that PCs didn’t, and with the release of Windows 95, the gap between the operating systems closed substantially.</p>
<p>Was Windows 95 better than the Mac? Any Mac user at the time will tell you it absolutely wasn’t. But Windows just being <em>decent</em> made it that much harder to justify buying a Mac in an increasingly Windows-centric environment. Windows 95 didn’t make Windows good, but it made it <em>good enough</em>.</p>
<p>And the technical underpinnings of Windows 95, most notably its support for pre-emptive multitasking, was a shot to the heart of Mac OS. This is a feature that every operating system today has, where the system arbitrates between different processes and doles out processor time. But the classic Mac OS did no such thing. Once an app grabbed control of the processor, it kept it until it relinquished control. If you were downloading a file in the background and then did something in the foreground, that download would just… stop. It was very bad.</p>
<p>At the time Apple was desperately trying to create a re-archictected Mac OS called Copland, which would offer <em>limited</em> preemptive multitasking, with the promise to follow it up with a more robust OS version called Gershwin. A Copland developer preview appeared at WWDC one year—I got the t-shirt!—but was ultimately scrapped. Apple had to turn to outsiders to find a solution to its operating system problems, auditioning BeOS before finally purchasing NeXt Inc. and getting both the foundations of Mac OS X and Steve Jobs at once.</p>
<p>Mac OS X helped Apple build back up the Mac, but in the intervening years, the dominance of Windows accelerated, to the point where Microsoft essentially needed to prop up Apple with investment and promises of future Microsoft Office development in order to prevent the Mac from fading away entirely and giving Microsoft a complete PC monopoly.</p>
<p>Windows 95: So what? It made a huge impact on the Mac, driving Apple to the edge of oblivion. It’s kind of a miracle that the Mac survived it. So there.</p>

    <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports today that experts are having second thoughts about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-lockdowns-economy-pandemic-recession-business-shutdown-sweden-coronavirus-11598281419?mod=hp_lead_pos5">blunt lockdowns in response to a pandemic like COVID-19:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to Covid-19, lockdowns weren’t part of the standard epidemic tool kit, which was primarily designed with flu in mind&#8230;.<strong>By late March, [epidemiologists] had changed their minds.</strong> The sight of hospitals in Italy overwhelmed with dying patients shocked people in other countries. Covid-19 was much deadlier than flu, it was able to spread asymptomatically, and it had no vaccine or effective therapy.</p>
<p>&#8230;.Sweden took a different approach. <strong>Instead of lockdowns, it imposed only modest restrictions to keep cases at levels its hospitals could handle.</strong> Sweden has suffered more deaths per capita than neighboring Denmark but fewer than Britain, and it has paid less of an economic price than either, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Sweden’s current infection and death rates are as low as the rest of Europe’s, suggesting to some experts the country may be close to herd immunity. That is the point at which enough of the population is immune, due to prior exposure or vaccination, so that person-to-person transmission declines and the epidemic dies out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conventional wisdom these days is that Sweden&#8217;s moderate approach didn&#8217;t work. And it&#8217;s certainly true that their death rate from COVID-19 has been pretty high. At the same time, part of their strategy has always been to impose restrictions that people can tolerate for a very long time. This might produce higher than average death rates at first, but it might produce <em>lower</em> than average death rates over a full cycle of the infection, including the second COVID-19 wave expected to come in winter. So the big question is how Sweden will compare to other countries once we&#8217;ve been through that second wave.</p>
<p>For this reason, I remain extremely interested in the Swedish approach. It might be a failure, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll know for sure until next year.</p>

Apple’s final near-death experience and subsequent revival has wiped away a lot of memories of the darkest era in Apple history. Apple introduced <a href="https://lowendmac.com/1994/blackbird-the-powerbook-500-series/">the PowerBook 500 series</a> to replace the original PowerBooks, and the original laptops proved to be a tough act to follow. It got worse during the transition to PowerPC processors, when the new PowerBook 5300 arrived—and erased all the goodwill Apple had built up over the years.</p>
<p>The PowerBook 500 series was code-named Blackbird, and while they look boxy by today’s standards, they were much curvier than the original PowerBooks, made of lighter-weight plastics and with a redesigned keyboard that added a row of function keys (and a properly placed escape key). They were also, unfortunately, a lot heavier.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/macworld-blackbird.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>(Macworld magazine, July 1994.)</figcaption></figure><p>Most notably, Blackbird replaced the trackball of the original PowerBook line with a completely new sort of device. It’s so easy to point and laugh now, like watching cave people discover fire, but at the time the little spinning trackball of the PowerBook was one of the device’s most iconic features. Explaining what was replacing it took a little bit of effort.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trackpad.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Someone had to popularize the trackpad.</figcaption></figure><p>It was “what Apple calls a <em>trackpad</em>, a slightly recessed rectangle of black composite material,” according to <em>MacUser</em>. Most MacUser editors who tried it preferred it to the trackball.</p>
<p>MacWEEK referred to it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A rectangular, high-resolution touch pad that controls the pointer. Called Midas TouchPad, it reportedly uses special tracking software to increase the distance the mouse travels across the screen the faster a user’s finger moves on the touch pad’s glass. Sources said Midas takes some getting used to, but it is both more reliable and accurate than a trackball.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Trackpad? TouchPad? Midas? I dunno. Whatever you call it, it’s still going strong 25 years later.</p>
<p>Blackbird was modular, too: it had two battery bays, but you could remove one of the batteries and instead replace it with other accessories that could be directly plugged into the PowerBook’s processor. The $199 PowerBook Expansion Module let you use PCMCIA expansion cards, which were becoming common on PC laptops. But the module was wonky and Mac support for PC Cards was almost nonexistent and the module didn’t even quite meet the actual PCMCIA standard so some stuff just… didn’t work.</p>
<p>Blackbird also rolled out just after the Mac had begun its transition to using PowerPC processors, but they were built with older-generation Motorola 68LC040 processors instead. To make Blackbird not seem instantly outdated (although it sort of was!), Apple promoted all the 500-series PowerBooks as “PowerPC upgradeable” via an add-on daughtercard that would be available in 1995. But at launch Apple had no price estimates or spec details for those upgrades.</p>
<p>Turns out, Apple was really slow to offer those upgrades. So slow, in fact, that they were beaten to the punch by Newer Technology, which offered the NUpowr upgrade card for 500-series PowerBooks. Not only did Newer beat Apple’s single upgrade to market, but the Newer upgrade cards ran a faster processor than the one in Apple’s kit.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerpc-powerbook.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>At long last, a PowerPC PowerBook. But about that battery…</figcaption></figure><p>It was a bumpy ride, but a year later, it got bumpier. In 1995, the PowerBook finally entered the PowerPC world, with the PowerBook 5300. (So named because Power PowerBook would’ve been a <em>really</em> dumb name.) The 5300 was a boxier design—in the articles from the time, the disappointment over the design is palpable (“The industrial design is still PC wannabe!” raved MacWEEK’s Andrew Gore)—and it made a bad first impression.</p>
<p>This is a laptop that shipped too soon, with buggy software—and it was savaged in early reviews. MacWEEK gave it “one of the worst [reviews the publication had] ever given an Apple product,” citing frequent system crashes that rendered two of their review models unusable. A software update <em>five months</em> after release fixed some of these problems, but many early 5300 logic boards were lemons, and needed to be completely replaced. Repairs could take as much as a month.</p>
<p>There was a built-in PC card slot that actually met the standard, which was good… because you’d need to use it if you wanted to connect the PowerBook to Ethernet or use a modem, since Apple removed both of those networking ports from the 5300. (That’s okay, I’m sure networking isn’t important to a laptop.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5300-side.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The floppy drive was removable, but it wasn’t a space large enough to hold a CD-ROM drive.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the Blackbird, the PowerBook 5300 also had two expansion bays. One was reserved for a swappable battery, and the other came with a floppy drive that could be swapped out for other devices—though very few of them every really came to fruition. The real tragedy here is that this was the heyday of the CD-ROM—people were playing Myst and reading Cinemania and watching a tiny, tiny QuickTime movie of A Hard Day’s Night on their desktop Macs—and Apple somehow designed the PowerBook 5300 with a removable storage bay that was too small to fit a CD-ROM disc.</p>
<p>It gets worse. The PowerBook 5300 shipped with a cool new battery technology, a Sony-supplied Lithium Ion battery. You can probably guess what happened next—this was the Galaxy Note of its era. A few of the Lithium Ion batteries caught fire, although fortunately not while in the hands of consumers. Regardless, Apple had to recall the 5300’s batteries and replace them with less efficient Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.</p>
<p>Talk about a messy roll-out: Here’s our new laptop! It caught on fire, wait, we’ll be right back! Now here’s our new laptop, now with 70 percent less battery!</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pittelkau-cover.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><br></figure><p>In 1995 I was a junior editor at <em>MacUser</em> and I remember that once a week, we’d get our delivery of copies of our sister publication <em>MacWEEK</em>, which was the newspaper of record for the Mac world. And for most of the summer of 1995, I’d read about the latest scandal involving Apple’s PowerBook 5300 roll-out disaster as I walked to buy my lunch at the sandwich shop across a large lawn from our office building. It’s a strong sense memory of mine: Lawn, sun, brown paper bag from Togo’s, and a copy of <em>MacWEEK</em> detailing just how terrible Apple’s laptops were doing.</p>
<p>The PowerBook 5300 series was star crossed from beginning to end. It survived for about a year before Apple had to kill it. It’s one of the greatest product failures in the company’s history, even if nobody remembers it today.</p>
<p>The cover of the December 1996 issue of MacUser has this line: “Has Apple fixed the PowerBook?”</p>
<p>Yeah, they did—by releasing the PowerBook 1400, a laptop that I dearly loved. But it really wouldn’t be until Steve Jobs returned and the “Wall Street” PowerBooks were released that Apple would regain its footing and start making truly great laptops once more.</p>

<h5><span style="color: #5b5b5b;">American G.I.’s with German children at the end of World War II. The soldier on the right, in the shadows where he always liked to operate, is Private Henry Kissinger.</span></h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In contrast to so many Americans, Kissinger has lived without hope, without expectations, and certainly without confidence in either the workings of democracy or the inevitability of progress. Policy, he has argued, must start from this grim vantage point. This is not a heartwarming perspective, but is there anyone looking out at the world today who would say that his pessimism is not a more sensible foundation for foreign policy than...optimism? That is why, given the current state of international relations, it is foolish, even dangerous, to ignore him. The lessons he has been trying to teach may not be to the liking of most people, but they are more important than ever before. ---from the introduction of <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-inevitability-of-tragedy-barry-gewen/1132051254?ean=9781324004059" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Inevitability of Tragedy: Henry Kissinger and His World”</a> by Barry Gwenn.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger?</p>
<p>I don’t mean “Why <em>would</em> I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger” as if I’m responding to a publisher’s come on or an overly enthusiastic headline on a review. I mean, plainly, why <em>do</em> I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger, because I do---specifically, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-inevitability-of-tragedy-barry-gewen/1132051254?ean=9781324004059" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Inevitability of Tragedy”</a> by Barry Gwenn. It’s not just that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-myth-of-henry-kissinger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this review by Thomas Meaney in the New Yorker</a> makes it sound like an interesting and well-written book. Meaney’s review made me realize I don’t really know much about Kissinger.</p>
<p>Of course I know who he was and what he did. But I don’t know what made him the person he was. He seemed to have sprung, a fully formed monster, onto the national stage when I was in junior high, and stayed there until I graduated from college, despicable until the end. And all I cared to know about him and needed to know was that he was directly and purposefully responsible for the deaths of hundreds and hundreds and <em>hundreds</em> of thousands of human beings. I knew, or, actually learned as time went on, that he was a Harvard professor, an expert on foreign policy, with a reputation for the brilliance of his scholarship and thinking. And I got a kick out of it when a friend who knew about this stuff told me that he was the model for Peter Sellers’ portrayal of Doctor Strangelove, even though Kissinger was not a former Nazi, just the opposite, in fact, a Jew who served in the U.S. Army in Europe in World War II and took part in the liberation of a concentration camp. But I don’t think I ever seriously thought about how he thought and wrote his way into becoming a monster and the architect and chief henchman of Nixon’s policy of mass murder in Southeast Asia and South America. How that happened, how Kissinger became Kissinger is something I want to know----something I <em>should</em> know. Something I think we all need to know, particularly political journalists.</p>
<p>I think he’s worth knowing as a villain and not simply a monster because villains are interesting in their villainy and because this one got away with it. He not only got away with it. He’s still celebrated for it. Hillary Clinton bragged about her friendship with him when she was running for President, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>I’ve written and tweeted many times that the wonder isn’t that we elected a Donald Trump president; the wonder is we didn’t do it sooner. I think the trouble the political media had---and to a degree still has--covering Trump as the villain and monster he is, is they couldn’t get their collective heads around the fact that a villain and monster like him could get himself elected to any office, let alone the presidency, despite the many examples of villains and monsters who have risen to the top in any and every industry, including journalism. It’s as if they believe that Nixon was a one-off in the whole of American history. Kissinger is just one of the most egregious specimens.</p>
<p>So I just checked “The Inevitability of Tragedy” out of the library, and it’s gone right on top of the stack of the fifty-four books I’m convinced I’m going to read by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But as much as I’m looking forward to reading Gwenn’s biography, I’m eager to read the as yet unwritten novel by whoever out there is the contemporary equivalent of Gore Vidal and who would limit their story to Kissinger’s experience as a young soldier and build it around his friendship with this character...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1942, Kissinger was drafted into the U.S. Army. At Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, he befriended Fritz Kraemer, a German-American private fifteen years his senior, whom Kissinger would call “the greatest single influence on my formative years.” A Nietzschean firebrand to the point of self-parody—he wore a monocle in his good eye to make his weak eye work harder—Kraemer claimed to have spent the late Weimar years fighting both Communists and Nazi Brown Shirts in the streets. He had doctorates in political science and international law, and pursued a promising career at the League of Nations before fleeing to the U.S., in 1939. He warned Kissinger not to emulate “cleverling” intellectuals and their bloodless cost-benefit analyses. Believing Kissinger to be “musically attuned to history,” he told him, “Only if you do not ‘calculate’ will you really have the freedom which distinguishes you from the little people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kraemer sounds like a real-life Baron Munchusaen who may have embellished here and there but didn’t exaggerate to the point of telling fantastical lies, just enough to make him an unreliable narrator. Which would make him an interesting choice for narrator of young Kissinger’s story, although, probably because I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/burr-gore-vidal/1100012768?ean=9780375708732" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Burr”</a>, I imagine Kissinger doing the narrating.</p>
<p>But the model doesn’t have to be Vidal. Conrad, Dostoevsky, Graham Greene---all good models. It’s just that, like I said, I have Vidal on my mind. And now that I think of it, I’m surprised Vidal didn’t write the novel himself and I’m irrationally disappointed he didn’t. It would have made a perfect cap to the “Narratives of Empire”.</p>
<p>Maybe I should write it myself?</p>
<p>First I have to do the research and get a lot smarter.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s more from Gwenn’s introduction to “The Inevitability of Tragedy”...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 40 years since left government service, Kissinger has devoted himself largely to two goals: the burnishing of his reputation and instructing the American people in the principles of Realpolitik. The first of these has provoked intense controversy with detractors and admirers lining up on either side...The second, while it has not been ignored, has hardly elicited the kind of thoughtful discussion it deserve, and the reason for this, I would say, is that Kissingers’s thinking runs counter to what Americans believe or wish to believe. He challenges people to rethink their assumptions. Kissinger’s lessons about history, power, and democracy can be discomfiting, even painful, for those who insist that freedom and democracy are the aspirations of people everywhere or that America is some kind of moral beacon. To argue otherwise is to be, well, un-American.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Kissinger...learned from his personal experience, but the lessons he drew are [dark]...As an eyewitness to the rise of the Nazis to whom he lost many members of his family, he saw that democracy was not a universal desire and that, under certain circumstances, it woulc lead to the worst tyranny imaginable. Sometimes, when people “seize their rights,” they do so in order to deprive other people of their rights. Whereas [Condoleeza Rice, for example, as she writes in her book <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/democracy-condoleezza-rice/1125246256?ean=9781455540174" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Democracy”</a>], understands human history as moving in a forward direction with transcendent meaning, for Kissinger history is more like one damned thing after another, unpredictable and uncontrollable; the basis of foreign policy has to be a pursuit of the national interest because, in an uncertain world, that is the anchor of stability. When correctly conceived, it contributes to rational relations among nations, giving them a shared foundation for working out their antagonisms; everyone understands where everyone else is coming from. World order is an end in its own right, and those Americans who insist on trying to impose their democratic values on others are likely to be disrupters of the peace, hegemonists by another name, or in Kissinger’s language, “crusaders.” One can’t expect too much in foreign affairs. The task for policymakers in his view is a modest, essentially negative one---namely, not to steer the world along some preordained path to universal justice but to pit power against power to rein in the assorted aggressions of human beings and to try, as best they can, to avert disaster. This is a perspective shaped by pessimism and a dim view of humanity.</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>You may have noticed something new in <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/08/bitbar-superduper-and-library-books/">yesterday’s scripts</a>: the shebang lines were</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve been using Python 3 for quite a while, but it’s been a version installed through <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, not one that came from Apple. The reasons are</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple didn’t provide a Python 3 until Catalina; and</li>
<li>I didn’t install Catalina on either of my Macs until this past month.</li>
</ol>
<p>I intend to keep using the Anaconda-installed version as my regular Python because its environment has all the tools I regularly use in my work: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. But the BitBar scripts were a good way to try out Apple’s Python 3; they needed Python 3’s UTF-8 support<sup id="fnref:utf8"><a href="#fn:utf8" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and didn’t need any of those math/science libraries.</p>
<p>While I said above that Apple provides Python 3 in Catalina, that may be stretching the definition of “provide.” If you look in <code>/usr/bin</code>, you’ll find something called <code>python3</code>, but that something may be just a placeholder. If you haven’t installed the Command Line Developer Tools, trying to execute a script via <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> will get you an error message about an “invalid active developer path.” This happened to me on one of my Macs; presumably, the CLDTs had already been installed on the other Mac and were updated when I switched to Catalina.</p>
<p>If you need to install the CLDTs, <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/">this explanation by Flavio Copes</a> of how to do so via the <code>xcode-select</code> command is clear and concise. Once you’ve done so, you can test your new Python 3 by running</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3 --version
</code></pre>
<p>at the command line. You should get <code>Python 3.7.3</code> as the response. This was the version released over a year ago, which means its remarkably fresh for an Apple-supplied command-line tool.</p>
<p>If you need to install third-party libraries, as I did with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mechanize/">Mechanize</a> and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> libraries used in my library BitBar script, you’ll have to run the Python 3 version of <code>pip</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/pip3 install mechanize
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll probably get a warning that your version of <code>pip</code> isn’t up to date. As with Python 3 itself, the <code>pip</code> that comes from Apple is over a year old. It’ll still work.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I don’t expect to be using Apple’s Python 3 in the future, but it’s nice to see that Mac users can use a modern Python without resort to third-party systems like Homebrew or Anaconda.</p>

<p>Sometimes you feel like you&#8217;re running around in circles, not making any progress, when you&#8217;re on the verge of a breakthrough. An illustration of this comes from integration by parts.</p>
<p>A common example in calculus classes is to integrate <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> sin(<em>x</em>) using integration by parts (IBP). After using IBP once, you get an integral similar to the one you started with. And if you apply IBP again, you get exactly the integral you started with.</p>
<p>At this point you believe all is lost. Apparently IBP isn&#8217;t going to work and you&#8217;ll need to try another approach.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/ibp_expsin3.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \int e^x \sin x \, dx &amp;= -e^x \cos x + \int e^x \cos x \, dx \\ &amp;= e^x(\sin x - \cos x) - \int e^x \sin x \, dx\end{align*}" width="362" height="87" /></p>
<p>But then the professor pulls a rabbit out of a hat. By moving the integral on the right side to the left, you can solve for the unknown integral in terms of the debris IBP left along the way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/ibp_expsin2.svg" alt="\int e^x \sin x \, dx = \frac{e^x}{2}(\sin x - \cos x)" width="247" height="40" /></p>
<p>So you weren&#8217;t going in circles after all. You were making progress when it didn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that gathering unknowns to one side is a new idea; you would have seen that countless times before you get to calculus. But that&#8217;s not how integration usually works. You typically start with the assigned integral and steadily chip away at it, progressing in a straight line toward the result. The trick is seeing that a simple idea from another context can be applied in this context.</p>
<p>In the calculation above we first let <em>u</em> = <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> and <em>v&#8217;</em> = sin(<em>x</em>) on the left. Then when we come to the first integral on the right, we again set <em>u</em> = <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> and this time <em>v&#8217;</em> = cos(<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>But suppose you come to the second integral and think &#8220;This is starting to look futile. Maybe I should try something different. This time I&#8217;ll let <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> be the <em>v</em>&#8216; term rather than the <em>u</em> term.&#8221; In that case you really will run in circles. You&#8217;ll get exactly the same expression on both sides.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say in calculus, or in life in general, whether persistence or creativity is called for. But in this instance, persistence pays off. If you set <em>u</em> to the exponential term both times, you win; if you switch horses mid stream, you lose.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the problem is that the winning strategy is to be persistent in your approach to IBP, but use your creativity at the end to realize that you&#8217;re nearly done, just when it may seem you need to start over.</p>

<p id="p4">The app, which packs unparalleled power for analyzing, visualizing, and understanding your notes, is beloved by researchers, writers, investigators, product managers, and teachers. That&rsquo;s because Tinderbox acts as a personal content assistant giving you the tools you need to discover connections and relationships between your notes that you might otherwise miss.</p>
<p id="p5">It&rsquo;s easy to get started by dragging out lines connecting your notes or use Tinderbox&rsquo;s wiki-like Ziplinks to link notes and ideas together. Best of all, Tinderbox adapts to the way you work. You can use mind maps with shapes, colors, and links to surface connections, or one of many other tools like outlines, word clouds, timelines, and dashboards. Each is a powerful way to gain new perspectives on your ideas, while adding as little or as much structure as you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p id="p6">Tinderbox also has agents and rules, and employs powerful AI tools to automatically identify names and places, look up addresses, and even suggest links. Of course the app integrates neatly with other apps too. Connect the app to Apple&rsquo;s Notes app, and notes you enter on your iOS devices or Mac can be automatically categorized in Tinderbox. Of course, the app works with apps like DEVONthink, Scrivener, Bookends, and others, plus there&rsquo;s <a href="https://forum.eastgate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a vibrant community</a>.</p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/ice-halo.jpg" /></p><p>I bought this <a href="https://geni.us/headache-hat">Headache Hat Ice Halo</a> &#8212; essentially an ice pack in the form of a headband &#8212; a year ago and it has been pretty life-changing for managing severe and prolonged migraines. I find the design of this headband helpful because it can deliver site-specific ice treatment for migraines. The headband is essentially a strip of ice cubes encased in a cloth cover with which you can shift around to target your worst pain.</p>
<p>For me, this more effective than the peppermint rollers which would try for a similar effect (at times the smell of these products is too much for me).</p>
<p>I like this version which is a headband versus a hat because it is space-efficient (there are full hat versions which would take up more freezer space). So long as I remember to leave it in the freezer, it is always available and can be reused over and over. I find the headband freezes quickly because the linked cubes are fairly small. Though I haven&#8217;t worn it in public, I think you could.</p>

    <p>With the Republican convention imminent, President Trump wants some good news. So he bullied the FDA into issuing an <a href="https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/us-grants-emergency-use-authorization-blood-plasma-covid-19-treatment">emergency approval for a COVID-19 treatment:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling it <strong>“a truly historic announcement,”</strong> U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed a federal government emergency authorization for use of convalescent blood plasma that he declared would “save countless lives” of coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Trump and his health secretary, Alex Azar, at a briefing for reporters, noted a 35% decrease in mortality among those younger than 80 who were not on a respirator, a month after receiving the treatment early in the course of their disease. <strong>“We dream in drug development of something like a 35% mortality reduction,”</strong> Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said alongside the president.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A &#8220;senior administration official&#8221; <a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/08/23/fda-announces-emergency-authorization-for-convalescent-plasma-to-treat-covid-19/">expanded on this:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>If you’re one of the 35 people out of a hundred</strong> who survive severe COVID symptoms because of convalescent plasma, this is certainly a breakthrough,” the official said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahem. The treatment involves infusing patients with blood plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19. This is very much a legitimate line of research, but it most certainly doesn&#8217;t save 35 lives out of a hundred or anything close to it. I know you count on me for chart-based versions of data like this, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1">so here you go:</a></p>

<li><strong>7-day mortality.</strong> Survival rates were about 3 percentage points better with the plasma treatment if transfusion was done quickly after diagnosis.</li>
<li><strong>30-day mortality.</strong> Survival rates were about 5 percentage points better with the plasma treatment if transfusion was done quickly after diagnosis.</li>
<li><strong>7-day mortality with high IgG plasma vs. low IgG plasma.</strong> Survival rates were about 5 points better with high IgG plasma.</li>
<li><strong>30-day mortality with high IgG plasma vs. low IgG plasma.</strong> Survival rates were about 7 points better with high IgG plasma.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, none of these are anywhere close to what most people think of when they hear about a 35 percent difference. So where did that come from? Well, if you cherry pick <em>one</em> of the results—7-day high vs. low—and calculate the <em>death</em> rate instead of the survival rate, you get 8.9 divided by 13.7. This equals 0.65, which means the high-plasma group died at a rate 35 percent lower than the low plasma group <em>on a relative basis</em>. This is a number that might be of importance to a researcher or a statistician, but not to anyone else. For the lay public, the basic result is that plasma treatment might improve your survival rate by four or five percentage points.</p>
<p>In other words, the plasma treatment is promising but unlikely to make a huge difference. It&#8217;s certainly light years away from &#8220;historic&#8221; and in no way does it save 35 lives out of a hundred. Four or five is more like it. Nonetheless, Trump implied tremendous results; Azar confirmed it; FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn stayed silent; and a senior administration official then retailed an even more ridiculous version of the whole thing.</p>
<p>None of this was an accident. It was carefully designed to mislead the lay public into thinking that Trump had decisively ripped a miracle treatment out of the hands of the stupid doctors and made it available to everyone. He didn&#8217;t. Tens of thousands of people have already received plasma treatment and that will continue with little change. Eventually more careful studies will be done and we&#8217;ll have a better idea of just how well this treatment really works. In the meantime, as usual, never listen to anything that Donald Trump says about it.</p>

    <p>My thanks to Wifi Dabba for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. I’ve never had a sponsor quite like Wifi Dabba — they’re looking for investors in the DF audience, not customers.</p>

<p>India is a huge battleground — maybe <em>the</em> battleground — for the soul of the open internet. Remember Facebook Basics from a few years ago, where Facebook tried to effectively own “the internet” in India with an offering that pretty much just offered Facebook’s own services? It didn’t work, but they’re back, having <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494033-facebook-to-invest-57-billion-in-indian-telecom-company">recently purchased a nearly $6 billion stake in India’s largest telco</a>. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally favor nation-states and existing telecom monopolies.</p>

<p>Wifi Dabba is attempting to solve India’s broadband problem from the bottom up. They’ve spent the last three years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. They use lasers instead of expensive underground fiber, and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100 times cheaper to deploy and 10 times cheaper for customers.</p>

<p>Right now they primarily serve their hometown of Bangalore, but are looking to expand nationwide. Their investors include YCombinator, VY Capital, and others — and they are looking for additional investors.</p>

    <p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">In 1960, when he was still in his 30s and already a renowned novelist, Norman Mailer wrote about that year’s Democratic National Convention in an article for <em>Esquire</em> magazine. Mailer’s article was called “<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">Superman Comes to the Supermarket</a>,” and it was later hailed as one of the most important forebears of the <a href="https://longreads.com/2015/04/01/tom-wolfe-on-the-birth-of-the-new-journalism/">“New Journalism”</a> movement of the ’60s and ’70s. Mailer was never known for understatement, and he declared in this article—written after John F. Kennedy had won the Democratic nomination, but before he had edged past Richard Nixon to win the presidency—that the 1960 DNC in Los Angeles, larded as always with forgettable political speeches, might turn out to be “one of the most important conventions in America’s history, it could prove conceivably to be the most important.”</p><p dir="ltr">Why and how? Mailer’s answer sprawled out over 14,000 words of observation, meditation, and digression. But the argument centered on the nature of the man the Democrats had chosen. The glistening young Kennedy—still then an aspirant, not yet an icon of history—was “unlike any politician who had ever run for President in the history of the land, and if elected he would come to power in a year when America was in danger of drifting into a profound decline.”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><blockquote>He carried himself nonetheless with a cool grace which seemed indifferent to applause, his manner somehow similar to the poise of a fine boxer, quick with his hands, neat in his timing, and two feet away from his corner when the bell ended the round. …</blockquote><blockquote>There was an elusive detachment to everything he did.</blockquote><p></p><p dir="ltr">There is so very much more in this piece, which you can read in its full immensity <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3858/superman-supermarket/">at the <em>Esquire</em> site</a>. (Jay Rosen wrote a wonderful, <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2004/07/21/mailer_con.html">detailed assessment of the piece</a>, back in 2004.) But during this past week’s convention, I thought of that one word in Mailer’s description: cool. Conventions have long been “hot”—loud, unsubtle, the political version of infomercials. The Democrats were forced by the pandemic to be cool, and every political gathering from now on will have to reckon with how effective they were. Starting this coming week, with the Republicans.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/democrats-nail-covid-convention/615442/?utm_source=feed">David Frum: Democrats nail the coronavirus convention</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">In the mid-’60s, Marshall McLuhan offered his <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media">famous delineation</a> of “hot” versus “cool” media. To oversimplify and put it in contemporary terms, hot media would be the infomercial salesman barking at you “Wait, there’s more!” in a 3 a.m. cable-TV spot. Cool media would be a storytelling podcast, inviting (and requiring) the listener to fill in the details of imagined scenes beyond what the narrator spells out.</p><p dir="ltr">That Kennedy was <em>cool</em>—not just in his look and personality but also in his approach to politics and persuasion—was one of many marker points in our political history. Obviously, not all politicians who came after Kennedy could match his cool, or even want to try. (As a rule, Americans tend to choose as the next president someone seen as correcting the flaws of the current one. This often leads to our sequence of temperamental and stylistic opposites: Ronald Reagan, after Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton, after the first George Bush. Barack Obama, after the second George Bush. And then …) But everyone who followed Kennedy had to be aware of what he had done and how he had changed the terrain.</p><p dir="ltr">Mailer couldn’t have known any of this when he wrote. But he set out the idea that there could be political changes few people fully imagine before they occur—but that seem almost inevitable once they have happened. Sixty years after Kennedy’s convention, I think we may have seen another such shift.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">Traditional conventions, with thousands of participants, scores of speakers, and countless opportunities to punditize and to schmooze, have been beloved by two kinds of people. Actually, they’re one kind—those whose business takes them to conventions—divided in two. One group is reporters who, like me, love the idea of seeing parts of history directly, with our own eyes, while mingling with others who share that passion. I consider myself lucky to have seen, in person, moments as consequential as the young Barack Obama making his debut at the Democratic convention in Boston 16 years ago, and the triumphant Donald Trump giving his acceptance speech in Cleveland four years ago. The vibe in each room was powerful and unforgettable, in their very different ways. (The group around me on the convention floor in Cleveland spent most of the evening chanting “Lock her up!”)</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/democratic-conventions-big-blind-spot-economy/615547/?utm_source=feed">Read: The missing piece in Biden’s convention speech</a>]</i></p><p dir="ltr">The other group is the participants—elected officials, staffers, volunteers, hangers-on, those already famous and those getting their start. People who go to conventions go precisely because of their messy spectacle and sprawl. What we love about conventions we would have loved if we’d been there to hear William Jennings Bryan give his “Cross of Gold” speech at the Democratic convention in 1896, or to watch Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller duke it out at the Republican convention in 1964.</p><p dir="ltr">But most people are not like us. Most have viewed the hot, sweaty, noisy, unsubtle conventions as inferior forms of entertainment, as out of date as William Jennings Bryan. Coverage hours have dwindled, and audiences have shrunk.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the virus, the Democrats couldn’t deliver the standard loud, sweaty fare. Now that their week is over, it’s “obvious” to everyone how much better, for nearly everyone, the streamlined, virtual approach is. Better for the party, in distilling a message (and not having it chopped up by procedural folderol or pundit assessments). Better for the viewer, in having their public issues presented in more varied, comprehensible, and simply interesting ways. Better with shorter speeches; better with less delay for ritualistic applause lines; better in pacing and tightness and focus. Better with presenters generally speaking <em>through</em> the camera, conversationally, to viewers one by one at home, rather than orating at a crowd. Better with more showing than telling, more explaining than lecturing. Just, better.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s obvious <em>now</em>—though I’m not aware of anyone predicting how much better a virtual convention would be, before it kicked off. (This is a point I discussed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/the-comedy-and-tragedy-of-virtual-live-events/615559/?utm_source=feed">last week on <em>Social Distance</em></a> with James Hamblin and Maeve Higgins.) And it will be obvious to the Republicans, as they ready their presentations for this week.</p><p class="dropcap" dir="ltr">How can what we’ve just seen from the DNC be considered “cool”? In simplest terms, because, compared with previous conventions, the Democrats were able to convey their themes more coherently than usual, with less old-fashioned speechifying about them.</p><p dir="ltr">In one way or another, every single minute of the DNC programming advanced one or more of these points and ideas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">the trademark slogan “Build Back Better,” which was the most normal-convention-like, and thus least memorable, of the whole affair;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Donald Trump is personally inadequate to the duties of office, yet also institutionally threatening;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that Joe Biden is an imperfect but <em>decent</em> person, with whom you might disagree but whom you would probably like;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that America is badly wounded but is not finished;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that the Democrats are in this together and are not sniping at one another; and</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">that you have to make sure to vote.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Think of the signature moments of these four nights, and how each was crafted to explain, to show, to underscore these ideas. It is churlish to pick out any one segment as “most effective.” Was it the fabulous reimagination of the roll call of states, which practically guarantees that this will never be done in the traditional way again? (Except perhaps in this coming week.) Was it Ady Barkan speaking through a computer because of ALS; or Gabby Giffords still relearning how to speak, nine years after her shooting; or 13-year-old Brayden Harrington magnificently persevering in his speech about stuttering? Was it Biden’s last major rival, Bernie Sanders, speaking with evident warmth for the man who had defeated him, or the Zoom-style panel of primary contenders sharing their memories of the campaign? Was it Jill Biden telling her story, or Kamala Harris telling hers, or Michelle and Barack Obama with their quiet-toned but deadly earnest message about the stakes in voting this year? Was it the tribute to John Lewis or the talk from Elizabeth Warren in a schoolroom, with children’s blocks spelling out <em>BLM</em> behind her? Was it Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, on what it will take to deal with the pandemic, or Kristin Urquiza saying that her dead father’s “only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump,” or (as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/dnc-when-convention-takes-place-your-living-room/615535/?utm_source=feed">Megan Garber argued</a>) the “In Memoriam” reflection on the many lives that had been lost? Was it Joe Biden’s implicit rebuke, in his closing address, to the constant Republican refrain that he had lost too many steps?</p><p dir="ltr">Was it—you can go on down your own list. The point for now is that the political world has seen something it hadn’t been aware of one week ago. The Democrats were forced out of the old, and figured out the new. They went from a hot medium, to one that was cool. In terms of political style, Donald Trump is pure heat. The rallies, the tweets, the boasts, the jibes. We’re about to see whether the party he leads will recognize the changed terrain, and how it might respond.</p><div class="feedflare">

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Jason Snell’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/put-anything-in-your-macs-menu-bar-with-bitbar/">recent post</a> on <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar">BitBar</a> inspired me to build a couple of menu bar notices of my own.</p>
<p>The first was a rewrite of <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/04/anybar-and-superduper/">the SuperDuper notice</a> I used to use with a similar menu bar utility called <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar">AnyBar</a>. It puts a thumbs up in the menu bar if the most recent scheduled SuperDuper backup was successful, and a thumbs down if it wasn’t. Clicking on the item brings up a summary of SuperDuper’s log file:</p>
<p><img alt="BitBar SuperDuper notice" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200821-BitBar%20SuperDuper%20notice.png" title="BitBar SuperDuper notice" width="70%"/></p>
<p>The log summary is in gray text because it doesn’t do anything—it’s like a series of disabled menu items.</p>
<p>The second BitBar notice is a little more complicated. It gets the status of items my family has checked out or on hold at our local library and presents them in the menu. If a checked-out item is due soon (or overdue) or if an item on hold is ready to be picked up, the book item in the menu bar is red; otherwise, it’s blue. Either way, the items are listed in the submenus.<sup id="fnref:nero"><a href="#fn:nero" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="BitBar Library" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200822-BitBar%20Library.png" title="BitBar Library" width="90%"/></p>
<p>In addition to the submenus, this one also allows some items in the menu to be chosen. If an item is due soon, it will be enabled in the menu, and choosing it will open Safari to the library’s login page. This speeds up renewing a book if I want to keep it longer.</p>
<p>BitBar uses the daunting words “plugin” and “API” to describe the code that configures these menu bar items, but they’re just programs that write lines of text to standard output. If you’ve ever written any kind of program in any language, you can write a BitBar plugin. There are <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#plugin-api">several rules</a> for the output, but the main ones are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple lines will be cycled through over and over.</li>
<li>If your output contains a line consisting only of <code>---</code>, the lines below it will appear in the dropdown for that plugin, but won’t appear in the menu bar itself.</li>
<li>Lines beginning with <code>--</code> will appear in submenus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You save the programs in a folder that you set up when you run BitBar the first time (before you have any plugins written). I use <code>~/.bitbar</code>.</p>
<p>My SuperDuper plugin, named <code>superduper.6h.py</code> in accordance with the <a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#configure-the-refresh-time">BitBar plugin naming format</a>, is this Python script:</p>
<pre><code>python:
 1:  #!/usr/bin/python3
 2:  
 3:  import os
 4:  
 5:  # Where the SuperDuper! log files are.
 6:  logdir = (os.environ["HOME"] +
 7:            "/Library/Application Support/" +
 8:            "SuperDuper!/Scheduled Copies/" +
 9:            "Smart Update Backup from Macintosh HD.sdsp/Logs/")
10:  
11:  def sdinfo(s):
12:    "Return just the timestamp and process information from a SuperDuper line."
13:    parts = s.split('|')
14:    ratespot = parts[3].find("at an effective transfer rate")
15:    if ratespot &gt; -1:
16:      parts[3] = parts[3][:ratespot]
17:    detailspot = parts[3].find("(")
18:    if detailspot &gt; -1:
19:      parts[3] = parts[3][:detailspot]
20:    return "%s: %s" % (parts[1].strip(), parts[3].strip(' \\\n'))
21:  
22:  # Get the last log file.
23:  logfiles = [x for x in os.listdir(logdir) if x[-5:] == 'sdlog']
24:  logfiles.sort()
25:  lastlog = logdir + logfiles[-1]
26:  
27:  # Collect data for BitBar
28:  notices = []
29:  with open(lastlog) as f:
30:    for line in f:
31:      for signal in ["Started on", "PHASE:", "Copied", "Cloned", "Copy complete"]:
32:          if signal in line:
33:            notices.append(sdinfo(line))
34:  
35:  # Format output for BitBar
36:  if "Copy complete." in notices[-1]:
37:    print("👍🏻")
38:  else:
39:    print("👎🏻")
40:  print("---")
41:  print("\n".join(notices))
</code></pre>
<p>The bulk of this script was taken from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/05/a-slightly-better-superduper-summary/">the predecessor to my AnyBar script</a>, which I wrote for <a href="https://www.tynsoe.org/v2/geektool/">GeekTool</a>.<sup id="fnref:geek"><a href="#fn:geek" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It reads through the long SuperDuper log file and plucks out just the lines of interest, putting them in the list <code>notices</code>.</p>
<p>The last section, Lines 36–41, looks at the last item in <code>notices</code> to see if the backup finished. If it did, it prints a 👍🏻; if not, it prints a 👎🏻. Then comes the <code>---</code> separator in Line 40 to divide the menu title from the stuff in the dropdown. Finally, all the items in <code>notices</code> are printed line by line to populate the menu itself.</p>
<p>The library plugin, <code>library.3h.py</code>, consists of the following Python code, most of which was copied from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2009/03/library-loan-tracking-again/">an old script</a> that sends me a daily email with the status of the family library accounts.</p>

<p>The BitBar-specific stuff starts on Line 128. It’s more complicated than the SuperDuper script, in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character used for the menu title is based on two criteria instead of just one.</li>
<li>It has submenus, the items of which are distinguished by a <code>--</code> prefix.</li>
<li>It uses the <code>|color=#700000</code> suffix to make overdue or ready items red. I’ve found BitBar’s coloring of items somewhat sketchy. Often the items start off black and don’t turn red until I’ve moved the mouse over them, away from them, and then back over them again.</li>
<li>It uses the <code>|href=</code> suffix to enable the menu item and cause Safari to open the given URL when chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, there’s not much to the BitBar part of either of these scripts. Now I’m wondering what other informational scripts I have that can be converted into BitBar form.</p>

    <p>Indie developer Manton Reece <a href="https://www.manton.org/2020/08/22/jason-fried-on.html">linked to this interview with Basecamp’s Jason Fried</a> that gets to the heart of how independent developers respond to Apple’s heavy-handed approach to the App Store.</p>
<p>Here’s Fried, <a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/e1099-basecamp-co-founder-jason-fried-on-building-hey-making-email-exciting-again-hey-vs-apple-more/">as heard on This Week in Startups</a> (<a href="https://overcast.fm/+JyGg_X1w/59:28">Overcast link</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the Apple decision would have gone the other way, I was considered quitting, and basically retiring. […] Here’s why: I didn’t get into business — I didn’t start a business — to be told what to do by another business. […] We’re self-funded. We do everything our own way so that we can do it our own way. And to be in an industry where if Apple forced us to have to give them 30% of our business and not be able to interface with our customers the way we want, I don’t want to be in that industry.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s Reece:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Even more than the latest case with Epic Games, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">WordPress iOS rejected for weeks</a>, that quote from Jason highlights what this is all about. Apple’s total control over iPhone app distribution and payment is preventing developers from doing their best work. The App Store started with good intentions, to help users, but the rules have become twisted, corrupted as Apple gains power. It’s not right.
</p></blockquote>

    <p>The legal filings from Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21397369/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ios-microsoft-developer-tax">just keep on coming</a>, as Kim Lyons and Russell Brandom report at The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Epic has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite">asked the court</a> to restrain Apple from revoking that access while the case is ongoing. Apple responded to the request on Friday, emphasizing that it was enforcing previously stated policies, but not denying that iOS support was at risk.</p>
<p>  Epic says removing support would be unnecessarily punitive, affecting developers who have built on Epic’s engine but have no direct interest in the case…. The filing came alongside <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf">a new declaration</a> from Microsoft in support of Epic’s motion, emphasizing how disastrous it would be to revoke Epic’s access to Apple’s developer tools.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I dislike many of Apple’s App Store policies, and think they should change—but let’s be clear about this. Epic can revert the changes it made to the Fortnite app specifically to cause the incident and still continue its lawsuit against Apple. Epic is being strategically smart in pushing hard to get that restraining order, but I’m skeptical that legal intervention is called for when Epic can defuse this situation by returning to the status quo while it presses its case in court.</p>
<p>Given how calculating Epic has been about every step it has taken in this manufactured controversy, I also have to assume that it knew full well that Unreal Engine would be a target. Microsoft’s support of Epic is understandable, given the importance of Unreal Engine, but let’s remember that this is a situation entirely of Epic’s making. In the end, will Epic’s status as a legal provocateur make developers more or less likely to use Unreal Engine?</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21397369/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ios-microsoft-developer-tax">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/epic-to-apple-dont-bring-unreal-engine-into-this/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>It’s not every day you see an Apple apology, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">Matt Mullenweg of WordPress got one this week</a> after Apple—spectacularly failing to read the room—rejected the free open-source WordPress unless it added Apple’s in-app purchase system, because some web views in the app could lead to the display of premium WordPress<sup id="fnref-14542-wordpress"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-14542-wordpress" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> hosting plans.</p>
<p>Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved. Since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app, it is now a free stand-alone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases. We have informed the developer and apologize for any confusion that we have caused.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s great, but this entire situation shouldn’t have happened. Not only is it predicated on the dumbest of Apple’s App Store rule choices—banning links to a company’s web site if there’s any way to get to a page that might possibly insinuate that there’s a way to give them money that isn’t via in-app purchase—but the act of approaching WordPress and recommending in-app purchases feels an awful lot like a shakedown. (“If you want to stay in the App Store, you might want to start upselling your users right within your app and giving us 30 percent,” Mullenweg might have imagined Apple saying.)</p>
<p>Also troubling: Mullenweg only went public with Apple’s rejection because Apple had, <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1297325896274030593">weeks before</a>, told WordPress that Apple’s decision was final and that they’d need to alter their app to add in-app purchases in order to stay in the App Store. It was only after Mullenweg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088">original tweet</a> went viral that Apple re-examined the decision, backed down, and apologized.</p>
<p>This shows that the old (Steve Jobs? Phil Schiller?) guideline that “going to the press never helps” may be the most hilariously false thing Apple has ever produced.</p>
<p>But let’s consider the larger issues. What is wrong with the App Store approval system that a major vendor like WordPress would apparently be rejected in a way that would have been entirely final without the intervention of higher-ups? What is broken within the App Store’s culture that leads a developer to walk away feeling like his only option is to add commerce to his free app because of Apple’s apparent hunger to generate more in-app revenue?</p>
<p>And most troubling for the company and its prospects for the future: What does it say about Apple’s <em>reputation</em> in this area that so many of us jumped to the conclusion that Apple was just shaking down another developer in order to make more money?</p>

      • John D. Cook
      
        • by John
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/22/hebrew-latex/">Yesterday</a> I wrote about <code>cjhebrew</code>, a LaTeX package that lets you insert Hebrew text by using a sort of transliteration scheme. That reminded me of <code>unidecode</code>, a Python package for transliterating Unicode to ASCII, that I wrote about <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/01/09/projecting-unicode-to-ascii/">before</a>. I wondered how the two compare, and so this post will answer that question.</p>
<p>Transliteration is a crude approximation. I started to say it&#8217;s no substitute for a proper translation, but in fact sometimes it <em>is</em> a substitute for a proper translation. It takes in the smallest context possible—one character—and is utterly devoid of nuance, but it still might be good enough for some purposes. It might, for example, help in searching some text for relevant content worth the effort of a proper translation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short bit of code to display <code>unidecode</code>&#8216;s transliterations of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<pre>    for i in range(22+5):
        ch = chr(i + ord('א'))
        print(ch, unidecode.unidecode(ch))
</pre>
<p>I wrote 22 + 5 rather than 27 above to give a hint that the extra values are the final forms of five letters [1]. Also if <code>ord('א')</code> doesn&#8217;t work for you, you can replace it with <code>0x05d0</code>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison of the transliterations used in <code>cjhebrew</code> and <code>unidecode</code>. I&#8217;ve abbreviated the column headings to make a narrower table.</p>
<pre>|---------+---+----+----|

| U+05e9  | ש | /s | SH |
| U+05ea  | ת | t  | t  |
|---------+---+----+----|
</pre>
<p>The transliterations are pretty similar, despite different design goals. The <code>unidecode</code> module is trying to pick the best mapping to ASCII characters. The <code>cjhebrew</code> package is trying to use mnemonic ASCII sequences to map into Hebrew. The former doesn&#8217;t need to be unique, but the latter does. The <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/22/hebrew-latex/">post on cjhebrew</a> explains, for example, that it uses capital letters for final forms of Hebrew letters.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the corresponding table for vowel points (<em>niqqud</em>).</p>

<p>There are people who think so fast, take in so much, who can follow your line of thought so closely they seem to be thinking right along with you---but then they see where you’re going and they sprint ahead, arriving at your conclusion before you even have it in sight.</p>
<p>I used to be one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Read The Magnet</strong><br />
If you like Recomendo, I think you’ll like the new longer-form newsletter I just launched. Every week in <a href="https://themagnet.substack.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">The Magnet</a> I write about tips I find useful, things that interest me, what I’ve learned, interviews, recipes, quotations, and more.

They claim to have stolen MasterClass’ content and paired it up with wikiHow’s iconic visuals. I’m not sure how accurate or effective these summaries are, but as someone who prefers to read rather than watch video tutorials, I appreciate this little unauthorized sneak peak into the MasterClass series. I’m not sure how long this website will be up, so I’ve taken screen captures of the ones that interest me.

<p><strong>Granite-coated non-stick cookware</strong><br />
For years, my family has been using Le Creuset cast iron pans. The large one is almost too heavy for my wife to deal with. Also, they take a long time to heat up. While we are not ready to get rid of them, I recently discovered <a href="https://geni.us/carote?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Carote non-stick frying pans</a>. They’re coated with some kind of natural Granite material and they have a bakelite handle that stays cool (unlike the Le Creuset handles that get extremely hot). The aluminum Carote heats up quickly, and it is the best non-stick frying pan I’ve ever had. Everything just slides right out of it and it’s very easy to clean with water and a paper towel. you can try out the 8-inch frying pan, which costs under $15 to see if you like it before buying a larger pan. — MF</p>

<p><strong>Pocket gel pens</strong><br />

    <p>Two polynomials <em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>q</em>(<em>x</em>) are said to be permutable if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>p</em>(<em>q</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>q</em>(<em>p</em>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>. It&#8217;s not hard to see that Chebyshev polynomials are permutable.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>) = cos (<em>n </em>arccos(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>where <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is the <em>n</em>th Chebyshev polyomial. You can take this as a definition, or if you prefer another approach to defining the Chebyshev polynomials it&#8217;s a theorem.</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s easy to show that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">cos(<em>m</em> arccos(cos(<em>n</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)))) = cos(<em>mn</em> arccos(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<p>Then the polynomials <em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> and <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> must be permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>T</em><sub><em>mn</em></sub> (<em>x</em>) = <em>T</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>x</em>))</p>
<p>for all <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more family of polynomials that are permutable, and that&#8217;s the power polynomials <em>x</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>. They are trivially permutable because</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(<em>x</em><sup><em>m</em></sup>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> = (<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>)<sup><em>m</em></sup>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Chebyshev polynomials and the power polynomials are essentially [1] the only permutable sequence of polynomials.</p>

</ul>
<p>[1] Here&#8217;s what &#8220;essentially&#8221; means. A set of polynomials, at least one of each positive degree, that all permute with each other is called a <strong>chain</strong>. Two polynomials <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are <strong>similar</strong> if there is an affine polynomial</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">λ(<em>x</em>)<em> = <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em></em></p>
<p>such that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) = λ<sup>-1</sup>( <em>q</em>( λ(<em>x</em>) ) ).</p>
<p>Then any permutable chain is similar to either the power polynomials or the Chebyshev polynomials.
