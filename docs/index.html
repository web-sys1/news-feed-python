<blockquote><p>
  Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1289710804338647040?s=20">@DongleBookPro</a> has today posted images of what seems to be a first-generation iPod Touch prototype with a 2013 Mac Pro-style glossy black finish.</p>
<p>  The Twitter user claims that the iPod Touch prototype pictured has &#8220;the same coating as the 2013 Mac Pro.&#8221; Had the finish been selected for the final product, it would have been the first metallic glossy black finish to be shipped on an Apple device.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the device:</p>

<p><strong>Classy free fonts</strong><br />
There are about 1,000 very classy fonts available for free on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. These are fonts you would actually want to use in your book or on your website. Some are commissioned by Google and designed by world-class typographers, such as the font Roboto used in Google maps. Many of these fonts come as families with different weights, italic, bold, extra glyphs, etc. This set of open fonts is also offered by Adobe and Monotype; what Google Fonts offer is a very nifty web interface for navigating through the collection, including good search and filter. I particularly like their font “pairing” function, which suggests good combinations of fonts (like text and captions pairings). All the fonts are license-free. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Craft in action</strong><br />
Everyone knows Anthony Bourdain’s various travel/food series, but in 2015 Bourdain did his hanging-out thing with master craftsman and craftswomen, going to their shops, watching them work with their tools, and at times trying his own hand at their craft. I can watch masters work all day. Their obsession with details is astounding, and their extreme excellence is captured in 14 episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdg0QhLNc29XuXmmv5Vu__bfNUeZI76ve&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Raw Craft</a>. The art ranges from hand-tailored suits to a traditional letter-press printer, all sponsored by a whiskey company, and available on YouTube. — KK</p>

<p><strong>Words of wisdom from GPT-2</strong><br />
GPT-2 is an application that produces novel text based on a text prompt (<a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/run-openais-new-gpt-2-text-generator-code-with-your-gpu/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Here’s how to install it</a>). Most of what it generates hovers on the border of sense and nonsense. Here are four pieces of advice it has given to me.  — MF</p>
<ul class="revue-ul">
<li>“If we cannot make sense of the present, we cannot plan for the future.”</li>
<li>“The more we change to meet the challenges in our lives, not to stay where we are, the more successful we will be.”</li>
<li>“If it is an animal you have seen, do you think it will be like you, too? This is the first statement of my doctrine, that all things are one thing. Do you want me to prove it, or to let it pass?” —Philosopher Epicurus (384-399 A.D.)</li>
<li>“Your gut tells you it’s not right to continue investing in some idea–it’s too risky, because its consequences are hard to understand. Your gut is right about one thing, though: there is no way of knowing it’s not wrong to spend your energy making the best decision for yourself and your goals.”</li>

<p><strong>Fun and powerful photo editing app</strong><br />
It’s incredibly fun to use the <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-award-winning-luminar-4-bundle?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Luminar</a> photo editing application to bring my photos to life. (Here are some of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWnNav04OUZsflczhGitdZEpOTdBcVHd?usp=sharing&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">before-and-after photos</a>.) It has tons of adjustable preset filters and a lot of specialized tools such as portrait enhancement, where you can make the subject’s eyes larger and face thinner. You can also easily add in new skies and even a sun with rays. I typically use the “AI” set of adjustment tools to change the brightness and contrast because it does a great job without a lot of fussing on my part. The developer also has lots of excellent videos that show you how to use all the features in Luminar. Here’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/390496469?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">30-second video overview</a>. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Drying rack replacement</strong><br />

It’s extremely absorbent and dries super fast. When I’m done with it, I just fold it up and put it in a drawer. It’s also machine washable. I love it. — CD</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Last week, Dan Moren wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/automate-this-how-hot-does-it-feel/">a nice post</a> about calculating the heat index in Shortcuts. I’d written a similar shortcut a few days earlier to calculate the dewpoint (it must be a summer thing), but it was kind of crappy and I had put it aside. Inspired by Dan’s work, I returned to my dewpoint shortcut and cleaned it up.</p>
<p>While I’m sure the dewpoint is included in some weather apps, it isn’t in the stock Weather app. It is, in theory at least, part of the data set returned by the <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> action in Shortcuts. I say “in theory” because I’ve found that quite often the Dewpoint entry is empty when that action is run. Why that is I don’t know, but that was the reason my original dewpoint shortcut was disappointing.</p>
<p>The improved shortcut, which you can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8443b306698142e2b0da7fd412c11045">download</a>, uses a calculation when <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> falls short. Here it is:</p>

<p>The <code>Weather Conditions</code> magic variable is used repeatedly in the shortcut to get at certain data. For example, when we need the temperature, we add <code>Weather Conditions</code> and choose Temperature from the list of data.</p>
<p><img alt="Specific info from weather conditions" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Specific%20info%20from%20weather%20conditions.jpg" title="Specific info from weather conditions" width="50%"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the name of the type of data chosen is displayed in the shortcut. For certain data, like Temperature, we also get to choose the units.</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing the units" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Choosing%20the%20units.jpg" title="Choosing the units" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Here’s the JavaScript code from Step 6:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:
 1:  function dewpoint(t, rh) {
 2:    let A = 17.625;
 3:    let B = 243.04;
 4:    let part = Math.log(rh/100) + A*t/(B + t);
 5:    return B*part/(A - part);
 6:  }
 7:  
 8:  let rh = ☐ Weather Conditions (Humidity);  // number
 9:  let t = '☐ Weather Conditions (Temperature)'; // string
10:  t = t.match(/[-\d.]+/);
11:  t = parseFloat(t);
12:  
13:  return dewpoint(t, rh)*9/5 + 32;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dewpoint</code> function is based on this equation:</p>

\[T_d = \frac{ B \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)   + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right]}{A - \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)  + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right] }\]

<p>This is a curve fit, where \(T\) is the normal (dry bulb) temperature in Celsius, \(RH\) is the relative humidity in percent, and \(T_d\) is the dewpoint in Celsius. The parameters that give a good fit are \(A = 17.625\) and \(B = 243.04\). I got the formula from <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225">this nice survey paper</a> by Mark Lawrence. Unfortunately, the paper has a typo in the value for \(A\), and I had to look up <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP5I-j3fzqAhUWCs0KHUNEBT8QFjABegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.ametsoc.org%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1175%2F1520-0450%25281996%2529035%253C0601%253AIMFAOS%253E2.0.CO%253B2&amp;usg=AOvVaw2b4OC7_lzQcU0vc5Jg5PO3">the original paper</a> by Oleg Alduchov and Robert Eskridge to get the correct value. Scholarship!</p>
<p>One of the great things about doing inline Scriptable is that you can stick Shortcuts variables directly into your JavaScript. That’s what’s happening with those weird-looking parts of Lines 8 and 9. Within the Scriptable step itself, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Shortcuts%20variables%20in%20Scriptable.jpg" title="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" width="50%"/></p>
<p>While the humidity is given as a number, the temperature is given as a string with “°C” at the end. Lines 10–11 extract the numeric part from the string<sup id="fnref:regex"><a href="#fn:regex" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and convert it from a string to a floating point number.</p>
<p>Finally, Line 13 converts the dewpoint temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Any complaints about this will be ignored.</p>
<p>Running Dewpoint directly from Shortcuts returns the output in this form:</p>
<p><img alt="Direct Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Direct%20Dewpoint%20output.png" title="Direct Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Running it in the Shortcuts widget on my phone returns the output within the widget:</p>
<p><img alt="Widget Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Widget%20Dewpoint%20output.jpg" title="Widget Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>This output is fine as written but not so good when spoken by Siri. There’s no pause between the temperature and the dewpoint. If experience shows that I’ll be using it mostly through Siri, I’ll change the Text definitions to be more like sentences.</p>

Nine years ago, he was a leading figure in my <em>Atlantic</em> story “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?utm_source=feed">Hacked</a>,” the saga of what my wife Deb and I learned when her email account was taken over by international hackers. For an <em>Atlantic</em> column around the same time, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/googles-michael-jones-on-how-maps-became-personal/266781/?utm_source=feed">interviewed him</a> on the way omnipresent, always-available mapping was likely to change people’s habits and lives. And before any of this, he had added to world knowledge with his explanation of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">Boiled Frog</a>” science. As he laid out in this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/07/guest-post-wisdom-on-frogs/21789/?utm_source=feed">guest post</a>, careful experiments in 19th-century Germany established that a frog would indeed sit still in a pot of ever-hotter water—but only if its brain had already been removed.  </p><p>Outside our household, Michael Jones is known, among other things, as one of the guiding forces behind Google Earth and Google Maps. When you see your neighborhood, or your planet, from above on a computer, or follow turn-by-turn directions on your phone, he is one of the people you have to thank.</p><p>Among the bright sides in the current pandemic nightmare is the news that this spring Michael <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">received the “Patron’s Medal”</a> from the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/">Royal Geographical Society</a>, in London. I am by nature wary of anything involving the concept of “Royal” (for reasons <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/?utm_source=feed">laid out long ago here</a>), but I make an exception in this case. I am delighted to learn of this overdue recognition for Michael Jones.</p><p>As the Society’s announcement put it:</p><blockquote>
<p>The 2020 Patron’s Medal has been awarded to Michael Jones for his contribution to the development of geospatial information.</p>

<p>Baroness Chalker said: “Michael Jones is a role model for future generations of geographers. From his beginnings as a software engineer, inventing and filing his own patents, through to his role as Google’s Chief Technology Advocate, his inspiring career trajectory is charted by his vision to redefine mapping from static lines and symbols to an interactive geographical web of context and information. It’s hard to overstate the importance that Google Earth and Google Maps has had on the public worldwide and how Michael’s pioneering work has democratised and popularised cartography and spatial awareness. Today we recognise his extraordinary contribution and his continued advocacy for the benefits of geography. He whole heartedly deserves the Society’s highest recognition.”</p>

<p>Michael Jones said: “This recognition is a signal honour for an idea that started in my head and which, through the work of many, resulted in the Google Earth used by billions of people around the world. On behalf of colleagues who laboured to make this dream of Earth and Maps a reality, and in full credit to the inspiring attainments of all who have come before us in the quest to better understand the Earth, I can only say that the ‘Earth-in-your-hand’ idea has never had a greater friend than the Royal Geographical Society, to whom we humbly offer our gratitude.”</p>
</blockquote><p>As a fellow Yank, I will razz Michael for writing “signal honour”—but it couldn’t be more deserved, with the British <em>u</em> or without. Congratulations. And you can read more about his story and outlook in <a href="https://www.rgs.org/geography/news/michael-jones-patron%E2%80%99s-medal-recipient-2020/">this interview</a>.</p><div class="feedflare">

    <p><img src="https://www.johndcook.com/lunar_module.jpg" width="100%" alt="Lunar module and lunar rover, photo via NASA" class="size-medium" /></p>
<p>This post will illustrate two things: the amount of time astronauts have spent on the moon, and how to process dates and times in Python.</p>
<p>I was curious how long each Apollo mission spent on the lunar surface, so I looked up the timelines for each mission from NASA. Here&#8217;s the timeline for<a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm"> Apollo 11</a>, and you can find the timelines for the other missions by making the obvious change to the URL.</p>
<p>Here are the data on when each Apollo lunar module touched down and when it ascended.</p>
<pre>
    data = [
        ("Apollo 11", "1969-07-20 20:17:39", "1969-07-21 17:54:00"),
        ("Apollo 12", "1969-11-19 06:54:36", "1969-11-20 14:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 14", "1971-02-05 09:18:13", "1971-02-06 18:48:42"),
        ("Apollo 15", "1971-07-30 22:16:31", "1971-08-02 17:11:23"),
        ("Apollo 16", "1972-04-21 02:23:35", "1972-04-24 01:25:47"),
        ("Apollo 17", "1972-12-11 19:54:58", "1972-12-14 22:54:37"),
    ]
</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s a first pass at a program to parse the dates and times above and report their differences.</p>
<pre>
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def str_to_datetime(string):
        return datetime.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    def diff(str1, str2):
        return str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)

    for (mission, touchdown, liftoff) in data:
        print(f"{mission} {diff(liftoff, touchdown)}")
</pre>
<p>This works, but the formatting is unsatisfying.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21:36:21
    Apollo 12 1 day, 7:31:11
    Apollo 14 1 day, 9:30:29
    Apollo 15 2 days, 18:54:52
    Apollo 16 2 days, 23:02:12
    Apollo 17 3 days, 2:59:39
</pre>
<p>It would be easier to scan the output if it were all in hours. So we rewrite our <code>diff</code> function as follows.</p>
<pre>
    def diff(str1, str2):
        delta = str_to_datetime(str1) - str_to_datetime(str2)
        hours = delta.total_seconds() / 3600
        return round(hours, 2)
</pre>
<p>Now the output is easier to read.</p>
<pre>
    Apollo 11 21.61
    Apollo 12 31.52
    Apollo 14 33.51
    Apollo 15 66.91
    Apollo 16 71.04
    Apollo 17 74.99
</pre>
<p>These durations fall into three clusters, corresponding to the Apollo mission types G, H, and J.  Apollo 11 was the only G-type mission. Apollo 12, 13, and 14 were H-type, intended to demonstrate a precise landing and explore the lunar surface. (Apollo 13 had to loop around the moon without landing.) The J-type missions were more extensive scientific missions. These missions included a lunar rover (&#8220;moon buggy&#8221;) to let the astronauts travel further from the landing site. There were no I-type missions; the objectives of the original I-type missions were merged into the J-type missions.</p>
<p>Incidentally, UNIX systems store times as seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00. That means the first two lunar landings were at negative times and the last four were at positive times. More on UNIX time <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/02/05/leap-seconds/">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="">In light <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/tech/tiktok-trump-bytedance-sale/index.html">of current events</a>, I’ve been paying more attention to TikTok lately. By “paying attention”, I mean I’ve been watching the nightly batch of puppy TikToks that my daughters have lovingly curated for me.</p><p class="">So from this perspective, I didn’t understand what the big deal was with TikTok and why folks are talking about banning it in the United States. It turns out the issue is much more complicated than puppy videos.

    </p></div>
    <p>Katherine Eban has a longish piece in <em>Vanity Fair</em> about how the White House—and Jared Kushner in particular—handled the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, there&#8217;s a passage examining why Kushner and Trump <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air">showed little interest in a national plan:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: <strong>that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically.</strong> “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.</p>
<p>That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a scoop, though, since it was widely known among reporters at the time. Kushner, who was a sort of free-roving coronavirus troubleshooter in the early days, apparently started out trying to put together a national plan with his team of college pals and young banker types, but it never saw the light of day. By the end of April, partisan considerations had overwhelmed everything. Kushner and Trump decided that instead of putting in place a plan that would effectively crush the virus, they wanted a plan that would most effectively boost Trump&#8217;s reelection plans.</p>
<p><strong>OBLIGATORY NOTE:</strong> The White House, of course, denies all of this. Given their track record for lying about everything, however, there&#8217;s no need for you to take this seriously.</p>
<p>In any case, with Kushner in charge it&#8217;s not clear just how good a national plan would have been anyway. Kushner&#8217;s mysterious planeloads of pandemic supplies have been documented before, but Eban provides a case study of one particular Kushner brainstorm that illustrates how his &#8220;just get shit done&#8221; attitude played out in real life. The idea was to order millions of Chinese-made COVID-19 test kits from an outfit in the Middle East:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Normally, federal government purchases come with detailed contracts, replete with acronyms and identifying codes.</strong> They require sign-off from an authorized contract officer and are typically made public in a U.S. government procurement database, under a system intended as a hedge against waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>
<p><strong>This purchase did not appear in any government database. Nor was there any contract officer involved.</strong> Instead, it was documented in an invoice obtained by <em>Vanity Fair</em>, from a company, Cogna Technology Solutions (its own name misspelled as “Tecnology” on the bill), which noted a total order of 3.5 million tests for an amount owed of $52 million. The “client name” simply noted “WH.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be off base here, but the thing that really drew my attention was the invoice itself:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_856616"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 500px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-856616" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_cogna_invoice.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="1695"></figure>
<p>Does this even look like a real invoice? It&#8217;s not aligned right; it has misspelled words; there&#8217;s no customer information and no order reference; and just based on having seen lots of invoices in my time, it doesn&#8217;t look real. It looks like something that was whomped up in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all. The test kits were delivered in late March, but they were no good. &#8220;An FDA spokesperson told <em>Vanity Fair</em> the tests may have been rendered ineffective because of how they were stored when they were shipped from the Middle East. &#8216;The reagents should be kept cold,&#8217; the spokesperson said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reagents should be kept cold.&#8221; No kidding. A freshman chemistry major could have guessed that. But this kind of planning is what passes for brilliant thinking among the Kushnerites and the Trump administration in general. Ideology aside, it turns out that it really does matter if the president of the United States is competent.</p>

    <p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida
law enforcement placed a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida, under
arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the
biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history, one
that took over the accounts of President Barack Obama,
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon
Musk, Kanye West, Apple, and more to perpetrate a huge bitcoin
scam on July 15th.</p>

<p>But apparently, he wasn’t alone: shortly after the Tampa arrest
was revealed and after we published this story, two more
individuals were formally charged by the US Department of Justice:
22-year-old Nima Fazeli in Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard
in the UK. They go by the hacker aliases “Rolex” and “Chaewon,”
respectively, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>

<p>According to federal agents, Sheppard had used a personal driver’s
license to verify himself with the Binance and Coinbase
cryptocurrency exchanges, and his accounts were found to have sent
and received some of the scammed bitcoin. Fazeli also used a
driver’s license to verify with Coinbase, where accounts
controlled by “Rolex” allegedly received payments in exchange for
stolen Twitter usernames.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears Twitter wasn’t the victim of anything vaguely approaching an expert caper. These kids are <a href="https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1289396815003922435">such dingbats</a> they used Bitcoin accounts opened in their own names. This profoundly disturbing and dangerous hack was pulled off by unsophisticated pranksters.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder what actual expert hackers are getting away with on Twitter.</p>

    <p>Wait, sorry, this is the reality show one, not the fictional one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once considered a potential successor to Rupert Murdoch, Mr.
Murdoch on Friday resigned from the board of the newspaper
publisher News Corp, severing his last corporate tie to his
father’s global media empire.</p>

<p>“My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial
content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other
strategic decisions,” Mr. Murdoch, 47, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/james-murdoch-s-resignation-letter/5d16f07153370f9d/full.pdf">wrote in his resignation
letter</a>, which News Corp disclosed in a filing shortly after the
close of business on Friday.</p>
