    <p>Epic’s announcement that Apple is threatening to terminate their membership in the Apple Developer Program prompted me to look at the current terms of the developer program license agreement. The terms are pretty clear that Apple <em>can</em> do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><bold>11.2 Termination</bold></p>

<p>This Agreement and all rights and licenses granted by Apple
hereunder and any services provided hereunder will terminate,
effective immediately upon notice from Apple: […]</p>

<p>(f) if You engage, or encourage others to engage, in any
    misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act
    relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
    misrepresenting the nature of Your submitted Application
    (e.g., hiding or trying to hide functionality from Apple’s
    review, falsifying consumer reviews for Your Application,
    engaging in payment fraud, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a court of law, Apple seems well within its rights to terminate Epic’s membership. In the court of public opinion, Apple comes off looking heavy-handed here, especially as it pertains to Unreal Engine. To be clear, Apple is not banning or even mentioning games that use Unreal Engine; what Epic is saying is that all games that use Unreal Engine will be affected as a byproduct of Epic no longer being able to work on Unreal Engine for Apple’s platforms. It’s further escalation on both sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Epic: <em>Surprise! We snuck our own payment processing into a Fortnite update.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>Fortnite is no longer listed in the App Store and we’re not going to approve updates until Fortnite complies with our rules.</em></li>
<li>Epic: <em>We’re suing and releasing a video to all our users that paints Apple as an oppressive monopolist bully.</em></li>
<li>Apple: <em>We’re revoking Epic’s developer program membership.</em> (Would Apple have done this even without Epic having filed a lawsuit? Not clear.)</li>
<li>Epic: <em>Without a membership we’ll be forced to cease development of Unreal Engine for iOS and MacOS.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(Honestly, the most shocking thing about the Apple Developer Program License Agreement is that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/services-account/agreement/XV2A27GUJ6/content/pdf">the PDF</a> is entirely typeset in Arial. Clearly it should be San Francisco, but Helvetica would be acceptable. Arial should be a firing offense.)</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users
and a great business opportunity for all developers. Epic has been
one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing
into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS
customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company
as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the
Store. The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can
easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that
reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which
apply to all developers. We won’t make an exception for Epic
because we don’t think it’s right to put their business interests
ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a good statement. Epic has been clear that they aren’t seeking a permanent exception to the App Store Guidelines, or a special deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/amazon_apple_prime_video">like Amazon’s for Prime Video</a> (which Apple wasn’t going to offer them anyway — games are different). They want to see Apple (and Google) change their platforms. So the “exception” Apple speaks of, I think, would be allowing Fortnite to remain in the App Store with its own payment processing while the lawsuit is litigated — and perhaps allowing Epic to keep its developer program membership?</p>

<p>So who blinks first? I think Epic will blink, submit a Fortnite update that reverts to compliance with the App Store guidelines, and try to save face by saying, “<em>Look at what Apple forced us to do — we had to raise V-Bucks prices</em>”. But they’ll keep their lawsuit going. The lawsuit, I think they’re serious about. The Fortnite update with their own payment processing was a publicity stunt.</p>

<p>The thing is, Epic isn’t just a game publisher. They’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games">a platform vendor too</a>. One of the core things developers want from a platform vendor is stability, in every sense of the word. If I were a game developer who depends on Unreal Engine, I’d be irate at Epic. They’re creating drama and eroding trust over a fight that Unreal Engine licensees aren’t a part of and didn’t sign up for. Fortnite users — especially kids — might blame Apple for Fortnite disappearing from iOS. But professional game developers will blame Epic if Unreal Engine updates are hindered by this.</p>

    <p>India is the battleground for the soul of the internet. Global tech giants are carving another new piece in an internet that has already fractured into a Chinese net, US net and worse. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally tend to be the domain of nations and monopolies. We spent the last 3 years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. We use lasers instead of expensive underground fibre and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100× cheaper to deploy and 10× cheaper for customers.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">A few big scoops from Mark Gurman yesterday</a> that got lost in the shuffle a bit after Epic went to war against the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino,
California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early
as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said. […]</p>

<p>There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package
will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive
variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming
service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier
bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Apple One” passes the sniff test as a credible name for the bundle. But this description, if accurate, seems contrary to the spirit of the name. It’s not just <em>one</em> bundle, which to me is what Apple ought to offer. What Gurman describes is a frustrating jumble of à la carte offerings that seems no different than the current situation, where every Apple subscription offering is a standalone service, other than some sort of discount for subscribing to more than one service, but only if you subscribe to them in certain predefined tiers.</p>

<p>What Gurman is describing would offer nothing, for example, if you want Apple Music/TV+ and additional iCloud storage but have no interest in Arcade or News+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company is also developing a new subscription for virtual
fitness classes that can be used via an app for the iPhone, iPad
and Apple TV, the people said. That service will be offered in a
higher-end bundle with the rest of Apple’s services. Codenamed
“Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered
by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.,
according to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This service simultaneously seems like a very keen offering from a company that is focused more and more on health and fitness features across its platforms (especially Watch) <em>and</em> more fuel to the fire that Apple unfairly competes against popular services from third parties.</p>

<p><strike>Total scoop for Gurman here if this pans out — this is the first anyone has reported this, I believe.</strike> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/09/apple-ios-14-fitness-app-guided-workouts/">MacRumors had a report on this back in March</a>, including the codename “Seymour”, but if it’s a paid subscription and not a free app, that’s still a scoop for Gurman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will
work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as
many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to
save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the
package chosen. For example, if a family subscribes today to all
of Apple’s major services plus the highest iCloud storage tier,
that would cost about $45 a month. A new bundle could knock more
than $5 off that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not much of a discount. To me the whole point of a bundle should be twofold: a greatly simplified offering (“<em>Just buy Apple One and get it all</em>”) at a <em>very</em> compelling price (“<em>Even if you don’t think you care about, say, Arcade and News+, hey, you’re effectively getting them for free</em>”.)</p>

<p>That’s the secret sauce to Amazon Prime. It’s a simple decision — get Prime or don’t — at a compelling price that makes everything other than the free shipping on Amazon purchases feel “free”.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1293892274875768832">Peter Kafka, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long-awaited/predicted Apple bundles, coming this fall. The
problem: Bundles work when they include the thing people
love/want/need — sports for cable tv, free delivery for Amazon.
These bundles — per Bloomberg, are made up of Apple’s side gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great bundle offering does have a linchpin. And while Prime and cable TV are good examples of that, they’re at extremes pricing-wise. Prime makes it feel like a good deal for shipping and everything else is free; cable TV makes it feel like you’re paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels you never watch just to get the ones you do (sports or otherwise).</p>

<p>So let’s think this through and figure out what Apple One “should” include and cost.</p>

<p>The big difference with Apple’s services is that everything is a standalone service, with reasonable à la carte pricing. Arcade and TV+ are just $5/month, including automatic family sharing. News+ is $10/month, including sharing. Music is $10 individually, and $15/month for a family sharing account. Music and News+ cost more (and Music, alone among Apple’s content offerings, charges extra for family sharing) because Apple doesn’t own the content.</p>

<p>Then there’s iCloud, the paid storage tiers for which haven’t changed in years. Right now in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 GB: $1/mo</li>
<li>200 GB: $3/mo</li>
<li>2 TB: $10/mo</li>
</ul>

<p>My back-of-the-envelope proposal is that Apple One should cost $15/month for an individual and $20/month for family sharing, and include: Music, TV+, Arcade, and the top tier of iCloud storage. Make News+ a $5/add-on.</p>

<p>Basically: start with Apple Music as the lynchpin service in the bundle, charge $5 more than they currently are for Music alone, and include everything Apple owns the entirety of: TV+, Arcade, and iCloud storage. I think they have to charge extra for News+ to pay the participating providers — News+ is more like a bundle unto itself. And that still leaves <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209670">TV Channels</a> as extra monthly add-ons, too. What Gurman describes sounds basically like “<em>Pay for a bunch of services on top of Apple Music, get one of them free</em>”; what I’m suggesting is more “<em>Pay for one additional service on top of Apple Music, get the rest free</em>”.</p>

<p>That would make for a simple proposition at a compelling price.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>James Batchelor, writing for GamesIndustry back in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-31-30-percent-store-tax-is-a-high-cost-says-sweeney-as-fortnite-skips-google-play">when Epic decided to try launching Fortnite on Android without going through the Play Store</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company’s CEO Tim Sweeney tells GamesIndustry.biz that this is
in part to build “a direct relationship with all our customers”,
but that the decision is also “motivated by economic efficiency” — namely avoiding the need to pay Google a 30 per cent cut of all
revenue generated by the game.</p>

<p>“The 30 per cent store tax is a high cost in a world where game
developers’ 70 per cent must cover all the cost of developing,
operating, and supporting their games,” he explains.</p>

<p>“There’s a rationale for this on console where there’s enormous
investment in hardware, often sold below cost, and marketing
campaigns in broad partnership with publishers. But on open
platforms, 30 per cent is disproportionate to the cost of the
services these stores perform, such as payment processing,
download bandwidth, and customer service.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortnite, as a fully-supported-by-Android download outside the Play Store, wasn’t successful, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software">Epic begrudgingly put Fortnite back in the Play Store four months ago</a>. So I think a fair reading of Sweeney’s argument is that he’s OK with Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo requiring a 70/30 revenue split because they deserve it, because they invest in hardware, sell hardware at or below cost, and provide marketing campaigns that help publishers get their games in front of users. Google’s Play Store doesn’t earn that same 30 percent cut for some reason, even though (a) Google sells very little Android hardware itself, (b) <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/19/apple-earned-66-of-the-entire-smartphone-markets-profits-in-2019">the handset makers that do sell Android hardware generally do so at or below cost</a>, and when Epic tried going direct to users on Android they didn’t do well and determined they needed to be in the Play Store.</p>

<p>Not a great argument, in my opinion. I’d say the saga of Fortnite for Android specifically shows that Google’s Play Store does serve a role very much analogous to that of dedicated game console platforms. You can certainly argue that none of them deserve 30 percent of revenue, or that none of them should allow alternative payment services, but it doesn’t hold water to say that Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo’s rules are fine but Google Play Store’s are not.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s from 2018, and leaves out the other mobile app store: Apple’s. <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1273276548569841667">Here’s Tim Sweeney from just two months ago</a>, after being asked on Twitter why he demands Apple allow iOS apps to process payments directly but not Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consoles are unique in that the hardware is sold at or below the
cost of manufacturing, and is subsidized by software sales,
whereas iOS and Android are insanely profitable for Apple and
Google from just hardware sales and ads.</p>

<p>So I don’t have a problem with the concept of console platform
fees. Consoles could ultimately benefit from richer store
ecosystems though. What if some day you could purchase a game once
and own it on all platforms that support the game, PC, console,
and mobile?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same tweet in which he says “I don’t have a problem with the concept of console platform fees” he explains exactly why he has a problem with console fees. Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch fees are 30 percent<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-17">1</a></sup> and mandatory. Also, this doesn’t sound so much like a benefit to console <em>makers</em> as it does a benefit to console <em>players</em> and, well, to game publishers like Epic. The pro-consumer argument is perfectly valid, but it applies every bit as much to game consoles as to app stores.</p>

<p>As for the main thrust of his “game consoles are different” argument, it is undeniably true that Apple makes a lot of money from iPhone and iPad hardware sales. And Google effectively makes most of its money, across its entire business, from ads. But “<em>Apple makes enough money from hardware and Google makes enough money from ads</em>” does not a compelling argument make, unless you’re a pretty hardcore anti-capitalist, and Tim Sweeney does not exactly seem like an anti-capitalist. And in terms of the law, it seems generous to even call it <em>dubious</em>. It tastes like weak sauce even by the standards of sauce obtained from The Weak Sauce Store.</p>

<p>Even though Microsoft itself just got itself into <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">an Xbox-related high-profile controversy with Apple</a> regarding its iOS App Store policies, I suggest not holding your breath waiting for Microsoft (let alone Sony or Nintendo) to file a  friend of the court brief for Epic, or even to offer Epic a word (or tweet) of encouragement. If Epic registers a significant win against Apple and Google in this fight, the game consoles are likely next.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1-2020-08-17">
<p>How do we know the big three game consoles charge 30 percent? Here we can turn to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/22/app-store-economists">the report Apple commissioned from economists at Analysis Group</a> last month, leading up to Tim Cook’s testimony at a congressional antitrust hearing. Here is that report’s Table 2, “Commission Rates for Select Video Game Digital Marketplaces”:</p>

<table rules="rows" cellpadding=20%>
<tr style="border: 1px solid gray; font-size: 90%;">
    <td>Xbox</td>
    <td>30% (15% for non-video game subscriptions)</td>

<p>The footnote next to the “30%” for PlayStation and Nintendo reads: “Commission rate from third-party sources, not disclosed by the marketplace.” Which I take to mean that Sony and Nintendo don’t even reveal this figure publicly. This whole aspect of console gaming is something the console makers don’t really want to talk about.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>
  Epic says that Apple has threatened to cut off its access to all iOS and Mac developer tools as retaliation for sneaking a new payment option into Fortnite last week — a stunt that ended in the app being banned from the App Store and Epic filing a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple, claiming it places illegal restrictions on the distribution of iOS apps.</p>
<p>  Apple will terminate Epic’s inclusion in the Apple Developer Program, a membership that’s necessary to distribute apps on iOS devices or use Apple developer tools, if the company does not “cure your breaches” to the agreement within two weeks, according to a letter from Apple that was shared by Epic. Epic won’t be able to notarize Mac apps either, a process that could make installing Epic’s software more difficult or block it altogether. Apple requires that all apps are notarized before they can be run on newer versions of macOS, even if they’re distributed outside the App Store.</p>
<p>  Epic has filed for a preliminary injunction against Apple, asking the court to stop the company from cutting it off. Epic says it will be “irreparably harmed long before final judgment comes” if it does not obtain the injunction. “Apple’s actions will irreparably damage Epic’s reputation among Fortnite users and be catastrophic for the future of the separate Unreal Engine business,” Epic writes. Epic also asks for Fortnite — with its lowered prices and alternate payment option — to be returned to the App Store.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of people thinks that this will enough for Epic to come back to the App Store, but it also feels like Apple is dumping fuel on the antitrust fire here.</p>

    <p>Epic Games Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and has informed Epic
that on Friday, August 28 Apple will terminate all our developer
accounts and cut Epic off from iOS and Mac development tools. We
are asking the court to stop this retaliation. Details here:</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf">https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Epic’s motion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>First</em>, Apple’s actions harm millions of innocent consumers
worldwide — the players who enjoy Fortnite and other Epic games — which will sever their trust with Epic, a loss that is
impossible to quantify. Because Apple has now removed Fortnite
from the App Store, iOS users cannot receive updates and will soon
be stranded in an outdated version of the game, unable to connect
with family and friends who will play future versions on other
platforms. iOS users will also lose access to new content that
Epic regularly releases, such as the eagerly anticipated new
season of the game scheduled to launch at the end of this month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s motion suggests the only solution here is for Apple to be forced, by the court, to re-list Fortnite in the App Store while allowing Epic to continue using their own in-app purchasing system. The alternative, of course, would be for Epic to submit a Fortnite update that removes their rule-breaking in-app purchasing system. Until this is resolved, there are three possible states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple is forced to restore Fortnite in the store and allow Epic to flagrantly disregard the App Store guidelines on in-app purchasing until the legal case is settled.</li>
<li>Epic can remove its own payment system and Fortnite goes back in the App Store in compliance with the existing rules.</li>
<li>Epic refuses to submit an update in compliance with the current rules, the court refuses to force Apple to restore Fortnite in the interim, and iOS Fortnite users miss out on the new season, and new users can’t get Fortnite for iOS.</li>
</ul>

<p>(It’s worth noting that anyone who previously downloaded Fortnite for iOS can still get it. Like if you previously downloaded it and subsequently deleted it, or if you get a new iPhone or iPad and need to reinstall all your apps, or even if someone other than you in your family account previously installed it. I don’t know if that will change on August 28, if Apple goes through with revoking Epic’s developer account.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Left unchecked, Apple’s actions will irreparably damage Epic’s
reputation among Fortnite users and be catastrophic for the future
of the separate Unreal Engine business. If the Unreal Engine can
no longer support Apple platforms, the software developers that
use it will be forced to use alternatives. The damage to Epic’s
ongoing business and to its reputation and trust with its
customers will be unquantifiable and irreparable. Preliminary
injunctive relief is necessary to prevent Apple from crushing Epic
before this case could ever get to judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll just go out on a limb here and guess that no matter how this gets resolved, we won’t be seeing any more <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unreal%20engine%20demo%20apple%20keynote">Unreal Engine demos on stage at Apple keynotes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The morning Epic made these options available, Apple removed
Fortnite from the App Store, ensuring that millions of players
would imminently lose the ability to use Fortnite to connect with
their family and friends. Soon after, Epic filed its suit against
Apple challenging its monopoly on app stores and in-app purchases.
Less than twelve hours later, Apple notified Epic it was
terminating Epic from the Apple Developer Program, blocking <em>all</em>
Epic products from distribution through Apple’s App Store. Apple
specifically stated it would terminate Epic’s access to
development tools, including those necessary for Epic to keep
offering the world’s most popular graphics engine, the Unreal
Engine. The Unreal Engine is used to develop a wide array of
products including games, films, biomedical research and virtual
reality. Millions of developers rely on the Unreal Engine to
develop software, and hundreds of millions of consumers use that
software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a fascinating armchair quarterback game to speculate on what Epic anticipated from Apple as a reaction and what they didn’t. Pulling Fortnite from the App Store they obviously anticipated — Epic had both the lawsuit and 1984 ad parody ready to go. Revoking Epic’s developer account, I’m not so sure.</p>

  Apple Inc. on Monday told retail and customer-support employees that the company is expanding the time period when customers can subscribe to its AppleCare+ service.</p>
<p>  Consumers currently have a chance to sign up to the warranty-and-support program within 60 days of buying an Apple product. This subscription window is increasing to up to a year now in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>  “This gives customers another opportunity to protect their device and have access to all the AppleCare+ benefits,” Apple wrote in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg News. The company told employees the offer is available to customers who pay for AppleCare+ in full versus monthly payments, or for those that subscribe via installments on the Apple Card credit card.

    <p>Epic takes on Apple and Google’s dominance of smart phone app stores with an app update and corresponding legal filings and publicity campaign. What’s Apple’s next move, and more importantly, what do we wish Apple would do to change its App Store policies? Also, Apple releases a bundle with the promise for many more, which leads us to get a little bit sad about the state of Apple’s current service offerings.</p><p><a href="http://relay.fm/upgrade/311">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all talked about Apple keeping apps they don&rsquo;t like on the App Store, but this would be the first time we&rsquo;ve seen Apple basically put a gun to a developers head to force them to publish an app that&rsquo;s not currently on the store with an Apple defined feature set.</p>

    <p>Suppose you have two sinusoidal functions with the same frequency ω but with different phases and different amplitudes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>A</em> sin(ω<em>t</em>)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>g(t</em>)<em> = B</em> sin(ω<em>t</em> + φ).</p>
<p>Then their sum is another sine wave with the same frequency</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>h(t</em>)<em> = C</em> sin(ω<em>t</em> + ψ).</p>
<p>Note that this includes cosines as a special case since a cosine is a sine with phase shift φ = 90°.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/sum_phase_shifted_sines.png" alt="Sum of two phase-shifted sine waves with the same frequency is another sine wave" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>This post will</p>
<ul>
<li>prove that the sum of sine waves is another sine wave,</li>
<li>show how to find its amplitude and phase, and</li>
<li>discuss the significance of this result in signal processing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding the amplitude and phase</h2>
<p>Note <em>f</em> + <em>g</em> and <em>h</em> both satisfy the second order differential equation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>y</em>&#8221; = &#8211; ω² <em>y</em></p>
<p>Therefore if they also satisfy the same initial conditions <em>y</em>(0) and <em>y</em>&#8216;(0) then they&#8217;re the same function.</p>
<p>The functions  <em>f</em> + <em>g</em> and <em>h</em> are equal at 0 if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>B</em> sin(φ) = <em>C </em>sin(ψ).</p>
<p>and their derivatives are equal at 0 if</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">ω <em>A</em> + ω <em>B</em> cos(φ) = ω <em>C </em>cos(ψ).</p>
<p>Taking ratios says that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">tan(ψ) = <em>B</em> sin(φ) / (<em>A</em> + <em>B</em> cos(φ))</p>
<p>or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="border: 1px solid gray; padding: 5px;">ψ = arctan( <em>B</em> sin(φ) / (<em>A</em> + <em>B</em> cos(φ)) ).</span></p>
<p>Once we have ψ, we solve for <em>C</em> and find</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="border: 1px solid gray; padding: 5px;"><em>C = B</em> sin(φ) <em>/ </em>sin(ψ).</span></p>
<h3>Special case of sine and cosine</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the special case of φ = 90°, i.e. adding <em>A</em> sin(ω<em>t</em>) and <em>B</em> cos(ω<em>t</em>). Then sin(φ) = 1 and cos(φ) = 0, and the equation for ψ simplifies to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">ψ = arctan(<em>B</em>/<em>A</em>).</p>
<p>If an angle has tangent <em>B</em>/<em>A</em>, then it&#8217;s sine is <em>B</em> / √(<em>A</em>² + <em>B</em>²), and so we have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>C</em> = √(<em>A</em>² + <em>B</em>²).</p>
<h2>Linear time invariant (LTI) systems</h2>
<p>A linear, time-invariant system can differentiate or integrate signals. It can change their amplitude or phase. And it can add two signals together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see that changing the amplitude or phase of a signal doesn&#8217;t change its frequency. It&#8217;s also easy to see that differentiation and integration of sine waves doesn&#8217;t change their frequency. But it&#8217;s not as clear that adding two sines with the same frequency doesn&#8217;t change their frequency. Here we&#8217;ve shown that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p>Bode plots are a way to show how an LTI system changes in response to changes in its inputs. These plots show what happens to the amplitude and to the phase. They don&#8217;t need to show what happens to the frequency because the frequency doesn&#8217;t change.</p>

    <p>Acerbic YouTube take from Jim Sterling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screw the lot of them. Yes, Apple and Google need taking down from
their high towers. Yes, Epic Games has a point as it sues to keep
Fortnite on mobile devices. But absolutely all of them are as bad
as each other.</p>

    <p>Kyle Orland, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most if not all of the complaints Epic makes against Apple and
Google seem to apply to Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo in the
console space as well. All three console makers also take a
30-percent cut of all microtransaction sales on their platforms,
for example. […]</p>

<p>On mobile platforms, Epic is calling the same kind of 30-percent
fee “exorbitant” and says it wants to offer a more direct payment
solution so it can “pass along the savings to players.” On
consoles, though, Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">happily introduced a permanent 20-percent
discount</a> on all microtransaction purchases, despite there
being no sign that the console makers have changed their fee
structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. This is exactly the point I’ve been trying to make since the Xbox Game Pass controversy last week. Microsoft wants Apple to allow on iOS something they themselves will not allow on Xbox.</p>

<p>If you think Epic is right in principle about iOS and Android, then they ought to be making the same argument about Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. A computer is a computer. “Consoles” are a business model and user experience design choice, and the iPhone and iPad are effectively <em>app</em> consoles, where games are just one type of app. It’s a shame (in more ways than this) that Apple TV isn’t a bigger player, because it’s just another variant of iOS.</p>

<p>But instead of fighting the game consoles, Epic is taking <em>more</em> of a hit: Fortnite players on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch get the 20 percent reduction in price <em>while Epic still pays</em> the 30 percent cut of each transaction to the platform vendor. It’s a stunt, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Orland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe Epic just has a better relationship with console makers
than mobile phone makers. […]  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/9/21318965/sony-epic-games-investment-fortnite-unreal-engine">Sony recently invested $250
million in Epic</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/behind-the-scenes-of-that-incredible-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo/">prominently featured Epic’s Unreal Engine
5</a> in a recent major PlayStation 5 promotional demo, too. Even
Nintendo, which traditionally uses its own technology for game
development, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/7/14533324/nintendo-switch-unreal-engine-miyamoto">has begun using Unreal Engine for its own titles in
recent years</a>. In a way, Epic can’t attack these platform
holders without also attacking itself.</p>

<p>I’m sure that has nothing to do with it.</p>

    <p>Similar opening statement to their suit against Apple, substituting “Don’t be evil” for “1984”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a
unique motto: “Don’t Be Evil”. Google’s Code of Conduct explained
that this admonishment was about “how we serve our users” and
“much more than that … it’s also about doing the right thing
more generally”. Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated
its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do
evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew
of markets it has grown to monopolize. This case is about doing
the right thing in one important area, the Android mobile
ecosystem, where Google unlawfully maintains monopolies in
multiple related markets, denying consumers the freedom to enjoy
their mobile devices — freedom that Google always promised
Android users would have.</p>

    <p>Google’s statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through
multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the
Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to
developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite
remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available
on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the
opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring
Fortnite back to Google Play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can still sideload Fortnite via direct download from Epic, or install it from Samsung’s Galaxy Store (which only works with Samsung devices).</p>

<p>Dieter Bohn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given Epic’s outsized response to Apple’s ban — the lawsuit and
the 1984 ad — it’s a sure bet that the company will have a
response to Google as well. We’ll obviously let you know what that
is when it happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, can’t wait for the slick Google ad parody that I’m sure Epic has already made and has been waiting all day to fire off. Holding my breath here.</p>

    <p>You’ll forgive the pun, but <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">Epic Games revealed an epic update to Fortnite for iOS today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and
Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct
payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment
processing savings to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What costs $10 through an App Store payment costs only $8 direct from Epic. (That’s not really passing the entirety of the savings to the user — Epic nets $7 from a $10 App Store in-app purchase, but minus credit card fees nets about $7.75 from an $8 direct payment. But, from a user’s perspective, it’s a 20 percent discount.)</p>

<p>Epic shipped this feature via an update that was delivered entirely through the Fortnite app itself, not through a new version of the app submitted through the App Store. And yes, this entire gambit is every bit as against the rules of the App Store as you think it is. Epic did this without any permission from Apple and without giving Apple any notice.</p>

<p>The only question was what Apple would do. If Apple decided to play on Easy mode, their move might have been to keep Fortnite in the App Store but stop accepting updates to the app. (But again, Fortnite shipped this particular feature without submitting a new version of the app itself.) Playing on Medium difficulty, which is what Apple chose, meant removing Fortnite — an immensely popular game — from the App Store.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-13"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-13">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here’s Apple’s statement, in its entirety, which they sent to multiple publications (including Daring Fireball) hours after Epic’s opening gambit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App
Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and
designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their
Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a
feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple,
and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store
guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer
who sells digital goods or services.</p>

<p>Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have
benefited from the App Store ecosystem — including it’s [<em>sic</em>]
tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all
developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines
freely and we’re glad they’ve built such a successful business on
the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead
them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact
that these guidelines create a level playing field for all
developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make
every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they
can return Fortnite to the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was very clear this morning that Epic knew exactly what it was doing, and how Apple was likely to respond. In very short order after Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store, <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1293994211621167105">Epic filed a lawsuit</a>, which opens guns-a-blazing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1984, the fledgling Apple computer company released the
Macintosh — the first mass-market, consumer-friendly home
computer. The product launch was announced with a breathtaking
advertisement evoking George Orwell’s 1984 that cast Apple as a
beneficial, revolutionary force breaking IBM’s monopoly over the
computing technology market. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs introduced
the first showing of the 1984 advertisement by explaining, “it
appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope
to offer IBM a run for its money…. Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was
George Orwell right about 1984?”</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020, and Apple has become what it once railed
against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block
competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more
powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the
monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion,
Apple’s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology
monopolist in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s filing wastes little time. By page 5 it reaches the point where they accuse Apple of “illegal restraints” that keep Epic from providing its own competing iOS app store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic — and Fortnite’s users — are directly harmed by Apple’s
anti-competitive conduct. But for Apple’s illegal restraints,
Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which
would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated
store and would provide users the choice to use Epic’s or another
third-party’s in-app payment processing tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear, of course, what Epic <em>actually</em> hopes to get from Apple, either voluntarily or forced by the courts, but they’re asking for the whole shebang: they’re claiming it is illegal for iOS not to be as open to native third-party software as the Mac.</p>

<p>Epic also had a new commercial queued up that makes their argument much more artfully — it’s a strident parody of Apple’s iconic “1984” spot, with the obvious but still clever title <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4">Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite</a></em>. You really have to see it — Fortnite has a fun strong brand and they poured that into this. It closes with this title card:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation,
Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight
to stop 2020 from becoming “1984”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a preaching-to-the-choir aspect to Epic’s entire campaign, though. Both the ad and the legal filing seem directed toward an audience that enjoys decals of Calvin pissing on the Apple logo. The ad is in some ways a deft parody, and it is very saucy, but one thing it is not is funny.</p>

<p>Epic, in a very savvy way, is waging this war as much or more in the court of public opinion as they are in any court of law. And, ultimately, Apple stands to lose more in brand equity than in dollars, no matter how this turns out.</p>

<li id="fn1-2020-08-13">
<p>Playing on Hard mode would be Apple flipping the kill switch to disable already-installed copies of Fortnite on iOS devices. I don’t think that was on the table as Apple’s opening move, and even now that Epic has revealed itself to be playing hardball, it would be heavy-handed, to say the least. What makes this a fair fight is that Fortnite is already installed on so many millions of iOS devices. Popularity is power. Removing Fortnite from the App Store (which, again, also blocks existing users from getting app updates) is a big move, but most iOS users who are in Fortnite’s target audience already have it installed. That’s not tenable in the long run, but it gives Epic and Apple time to spar without disrupting existing iOS Fortnite users from continuing to play.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-13"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>
  It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of iPod Software—my boss’s boss—abruptly entered and closed the door behind him. He cut to the chase. &#8220;I have a special assignment for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod. Report only to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>  The next day, the receptionist called to tell me that two men were waiting in the lobby. I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew, the engineers who would actually build this custom iPod. I’d love to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats and were glancing in window reflections to make sure they hadn’t been tailed, but they were perfectly normal thirty-something engineers. I signed them in, and we went to a conference room to talk.

<p>They didn&rsquo;t actually work for the Department of Energy; they worked for a division of Bechtel, a large US defense contractor to the Department of Energy.  They wanted to add some custom hardware to an iPod and record data from this custom hardware to the iPod&rsquo;s disk in a way that couldn&rsquo;t be easily detected. But it still had to look and work like a normal iPod.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Finally, the iPod team developed on Windows computers. Apple didn&rsquo;t have working ARM developer tools yet, because this was before the iPhone shipped. The iPod team used ARM developer tools from ARM Ltd, which ran only on Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We discussed the best way to hide the data they recorded. As a disk engineer, I suggested they make another partition on the disk to store their data. That way, even if someone plugged the modified iPod into a Mac or PC, iTunes would treat it as a normal iPod, and it would look like a normal iPod in the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer. They liked that, and a hidden partition it was.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Starting with the iPod nano, the operating system was signed with a digital signature to block the Linux hackers (and others). The boot ROM checked the digital signature before loading the operating system; if it didn&rsquo;t match, it wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>

<p>In debt with student loans, Fran joined IBM Research in Poughkeepsie, NY as a programmer on July 15, 1957, where she taught incoming employees the basics of FORTRAN.  She planned to stay only until her debts were paid, however, she ended up spending her entire career at IBM.</p>

<p>This work led to Fran&rsquo;s seminal paper on Program Optimization, first published in 1966, describing a robust new framework for implementing program analysis and optimization as well as a powerful set of new algorithms. Fran&rsquo;s 1970 paper on Control Flow analysis introduced the notion of &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; and node dominance relations, important improvements over the control flow abstractions given in her earlier paper. Her 1972 paper, &ldquo;A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,&rdquo; identified and discussed many of the transformations commonly used today.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Unlike many of my fellow liberals, I don&#8217;t consider the post office to be the very sinew upon which our nation rests. On the other hand, it <em>is</em> important and it&#8217;s worth running properly.</p>
<p>Now, there are plenty of reasonable disagreements about how the post office should be run, but there&#8217;s one issue that seems almost indisputable to me: it should be able to set postage rates that allow it to break even. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Accountability_and_Enhancement_Act">federal law</a> allows the price of first class stamps to rise only at the rate of inflation, and that&#8217;s plainly not enough in an era of email, Instagram, and falling volumes of first class mail. The German post office surveys European postage rates every few years, <a href="https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/media-relations/documents/2020/dp-letter-prices-in-europe-2020.pdf">and here&#8217;s how we compare:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859603"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859603" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_first_class_stamp.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="627"></figure>
<p>I think we can all agree that four bucks to send a letter in Denmark seems fairly outlandish, but we can also agree that the current US rate of 55 cents is pretty obviously an outlier too. We have economies of scale, to be sure, but we also have a far bigger landmass to cover than any European country.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem with the Postal Service. Congress wants to look good, so they pass a law keeping postage rates down. Then, when the Postal Service runs deficit after deficit, they swoop in and insist that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re run inefficiently. After all, it couldn&#8217;t possibly be Congress&#8217;s fault, could it?</p>
<p>It could be and it is. The Postal Regulatory Commission has been trying to get the inflation rule changed for some time, but so far they&#8217;ve had no luck. Apparently no one in Congress wants to be known as the person who voted to increase the price of a stamp.</p>
<p>When it comes to packages, the Postal Service has competition and therefore sets rates that allow it to compete. That keeps package rates reasonable. However, there&#8217;s no similar competitive pressure on letters since the Postal Service has a monopoly on first class mail. This means there really does need to be some kind of oversight on first class postage rates in order to prevent us from turning into Denmark. The problem is that a simpleminded inflation rule is about the worst possible oversight you can imagine. It needs to change, and if it does, guess what? Suddenly the USPS would be in perfectly good shape even if first class postage remained lower than practically any country in Europe. If we really value the Postal Service, this would be the single best way to show it.</p>

    <p>Some of you may be wondering why President Trump seems to have it in for the Postal Service. It&#8217;s a short story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump hates the <em>Washington Post</em>, which is owned by Jeff Bezos.</li>
<li>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673881733415178240">tweeted</a> about this once and Bezos responded with a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297">joke</a>. Trump can&#8217;t stand jokes at his expense, so he hates Bezos.</li>
<li>Bezos is CEO of Amazon, therefore Trump hates Amazon.</li>
<li>The Postal Service delivers some of Amazon&#8217;s packages. As a matter of revenge, Trump wants them to raise the rates they charge Amazon.</li>
<li>They have refused to do so, therefore Trump hates the Postal Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe it or not, that&#8217;s all there is to it. Trump has been waiting five years for an opportunity to take revenge on the Postal Service, and the current ruckus over vote-by-mail has given him his chance. He&#8217;s pretending that it&#8217;s all about ballot fraud and inefficient management and so forth, but it&#8217;s really about the fact that Bezos—who is considerably richer than Trump—once made a modest joke about Trump and the Postal Service got caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that&#8217;s how the United States of America is governed these days.</p>

<p>Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.pdf?ts=1597165378">last week&#8217;s decision</a> by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing the District Court&#8217;s ruling that Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust violations, opened her opinion thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This case asks us to draw the line between anticompetitive behavior, which is illegal under federal antitrust law, and hypercompetitive behavior, which is not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, admittedly, a distinction I have not seen before, but it is perhaps a useful one, for the simple reason that being a successful business by definition means being anticompetitive: without some sort of differentiation and/or superior cost structure any sort of margin a business has will be competed away, and so preserving that differentiation and/or cost structure — being anticompetitive — should be the goal of any business. The distinction Callahan was drawing, though, is necessary if you interpret &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; as being &#8220;illegal&#8221;: businesses should compete, but they should not break the law along the way.</p>
<p>What makes this distinction particularly challenging is that the question as to what is anticompetitive and what is simply good business changes as a business scales. A small business can generally be as anticompetitive as it wants to be, while a much larger business is much more constrained in how anticompetitively it can act (as a quick aside, for the first part of this essay I am painting in broad strokes as far as questions of specific legality go). The specific case of Apple and the iPhone raises an additional angle: should the importance of the market in the question make a difference as well?</p>
<h4>Apple&#8217;s Vertical Integration</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s business model, which <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">uses software to differentiate hardware</a>, is designed to be anticompetitive. The company has traditionally made its money by selling physical devices which run Apple&#8217;s proprietary operating systems; its device-manufacturing competitors, meanwhile, have had to rely on an operating system that they could license, primarily Windows for PCs, and Android for mobile devices. They cannot license macOS or iOS.</p>
<p>What is funny about calling this strategy &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; is that it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that most pundits were sure Apple was anti-competing themselves into the ground. When Stratechery started in 2013, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-being-greedy-2013-9">media was filled</a> with predictions of the iPhone&#8217;s imminent demise at the hands of Android: there were simply too many other manufacturers making too many smartphones at too many price points that Apple could not or would not match, which would inevitably lead to developers fleeing iOS and Apple fighting for its life.</p>
<p>The problem with these predictions, as I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</a>, is that they drastically undervalued the experience of using Apple&#8217;s integrated products.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The business buyer, famously, does not care about the user experience. They are not the user, and so items that change how a product feels or that eliminate small annoyances simply don’t make it into their rational decision making process. Again, though, Christensen’s research is tilted towards business buyers. Critically, this includes the PC. For the most of its history, the vast majority of PC purchasers have been businesses, who have bought PCs on speeds, feeds, and ultimately, price…
</p></blockquote>
<p>I attributed Apple&#8217;s ability to eliminate many of those small annoyances to its vertical integration, which had long been out of fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The traditional business theory about vertical integration rests on the costs and controls…The issue I have with this analysis of vertical integration…is that the only considered costs are financial. But there are other, more difficult to quantify costs. Modularization incurs costs in the design and experience of using products that cannot be overcome, yet cannot be measured. Business buyers — and the analysts who study them — simply ignore them, but consumers don’t. Some consumers inherently know and value quality, look-and-feel, and attention to detail, and are willing to pay a premium that far exceeds the financial costs of being vertically integrated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing that is worth noting is that Apple has only ever integrated part of its value chain, particularly once it started manufacturing in China. A Mac, for example, looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png" alt="Apple&#039;s integration of software and hardware" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5226" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In this view Apple integrates hardware made with industry-standard components and macOS, providing a platform for even more app developers. Of course, this view of the Mac will soon be obsolete: Apple computers will soon come with Apple&#8217;s own chips, which is to say that the company is backward-integrating into one of its most important components. This is, as far as I can tell, seen as a good thing: Apple has both demonstrated its ability to build fast chips and to integrate those chips with its operating system; no one feels especially bad for Intel, particularly since the company had its own near-monopoly for decades.</p>
<h4>App Store Integration</h4>
<p>Of course iPhones have already been using Apple&#8217;s own chips for a decade; what has always made the iPhone different than the Mac, though, is the degree to which Apple has forward-integrated into the app ecosystem. What is critical to understand is that this integration proceeded in parts, and that those parts build on each other.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part One: Installation</strong></p>
<p>Start with app installation: because Apple controls the operating system, it controls what apps can or cannot be installed on the device. iOS will only run apps that have permission from Apple (this permission is ultimately enforced by Apple&#8217;s hardware), and Apple grants this permission via the App Store. To put it in the context of the value chain, Apple leverages its integration of hardware and software to control app installation:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png" alt="iOS integrated app installation" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5224" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-300x266.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-768x680.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It is essential to note that this forward integration has had huge benefits for everyone involved. While Apple pretends like <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1288297750690328576">the Internet never existed as a distribution channel</a>, the truth is it was a channel that wasn&#8217;t great for a lot of users: people were scared to install apps, convinced they would mess up their computers, get ripped off, or accidentally install a virus.</p>
<p>The App Store changed all of that: Apple effectively extended the trust it had earned with users over the years to all developers in the App Store. Users could install whatever they wanted, confident the app would not mess up their phone, rip them off, or be a virus. This by extension meant that the addressable market was far larger for app developers than the PC was, even though it would be several years before smartphones had a larger installed base than PCs. And this, of course, brought benefits to Apple:</p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-8FGJ5I8V-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8FGJ5I8V-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8FGJ5I8V/iphone3gtheresanappforthat_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8FGJ5I8V/iphone3gtheresanappforthat_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8FGJ5I8V/iphone3gtheresanappforthat_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="There&#039;s an app for that" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8FGJ5I8V/iphone3gtheresanappforthat_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>There&#039;s an app for that</p></video></div></div>
<p>This was the combination of integration and modularity at its absolute best: Apple leveraged its control to create a better market that benefited everyone.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Two: Payment Processing</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Apple controlled app installation, it was a natural extension into payment processing, particularly since the App Store was built on the same infrastructure as iTunes.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, like iTunes at the time, payment processing functionality was limited to up-front purchases. Suppose you wanted Super Monkey Ball: you had to pay $9.99 to even download the app; there were no trials or in-app purchases:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/10-years-of-app-store-a-timeline-of-changes/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png" alt="The original App Store" width="436" height="653" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5222" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png 684w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-200x300.png 200w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-768x1150.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-421x630.png 421w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996.png 873w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>From the beginning Apple kept 30% of every purchase; that was similar to the rate <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117340340327331757">the company kept for iTunes purchases</a>, and perhaps more pertinently, just barely covered credit card processing fees for a $0.99 app.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_0_5217" id="identifier_0_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Credit card processing fees generally consist of a fixed fee between $0.25 and $0.30 per transaction, plus 1.5%~3.0%; Apple of course would have had a significant volume discount.">1</a></p>
<p>This gets at why this was another great deal for everyone involved: most users had already trusted Apple with their credit card information, and again, Apple was extending that trust to every developer in its App Store, making it far more likely that developers would earn money on their apps than if they had to drive downloads and purchases on their own. And once again, this circled back to Apple&#8217;s benefit, both in terms of the ecosystem broadly and, as the App Store reached scale (and added in-app purchasing), real profits.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Three: Customer Management</strong></p>
<p>That Apple has controlled app installation and payment processing from the beginning is an obvious point; what is less appreciated is that Apple leveraged its control of payment processing, which was based on its control of app installation, which was based on its control of the operating system, into complete ownership of the customer relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png" alt="Payment processing integrated the customer relationship" width="640" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5225" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-300x265.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-768x679.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-712x630.png 712w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Users didn&#8217;t pay developers, they paid Apple, who paid developers. Users didn&#8217;t get receipts from developers, they got receipts from Apple, who kept their email address for themselves. This did have some user benefits, particularly in terms of ensuring their data was not sold to unscrupulous data brokers, but the benefit to developers was much less clear cut. There remains no means to offer refunds, for example, and for many years developers could not respond to negative reviews in the App Store.</p>
<p>What was most frustrating for developers, though, was that the lack of a customer relationship, in conjunction with the lack of functionality for upgrade pricing, made it difficult to build sustainable businesses in product spaces that did not have an obvious service component (which might require a subscription) or consumables (which could be bought with in-app purchases). The App Store was about transactions, not relationships, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">Apple liked it that way</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>These three distinct integrations, each of which built on the previous, were present in the App Store from Day One — and Steve Jobs knew it. He articulated what just took me 700 words in a crisp five minutes and seven seconds:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_1_5217" id="identifier_1_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Although I can&rsquo;t help but note that 2:30 mark has a very rare Apple presentation error: the Backgammon game should be on the iPhone screen">2</a></p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-s6wdT7tS-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-s6wdT7tS-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/s6wdT7tS/stevejobsappstore_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Steve Jobs Introduces the App Store</p></video></div></div>
<p>Everything about this video was exceptional at the time, and just as critically, nothing was objectionable. After all, the iPhone was still a small business; from a developer perspective, the App Store was (almost) all upside. It would be users who would vote with their wallets in favor of Apple&#8217;s approach.</p>
<h4>App Store Problems</h4>
<p>There is a bit of a running joke in tech that the mainstream media believes that every tech company is ridiculously over-valued right up until the day that the exact same company is a juggernaut that is killing industries; in the case of Apple, the company&#8217;s strategy was doomed right up until it was illegal, or so it seems with the App Store.</p>
<p>In truth, though, while many of the issues surrounding the App Store are about Apple being a whole lot bigger than they were in 2008, the company has, particularly over the last few years, extended its control further and further away from the core integration that undergirds its business.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the company required that apps that utilize third-party login services also utilize &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; (which had to be at the top of the list). This, by extension, meant that cross-platform apps and services had to integrate &#8220;Sign in with Apple&#8221; into their Android and web apps. This was in part a further assumption of customer management, and also an extension of control beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s control of the customer relationship has also helped sustain its control of payment processing; after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller">Amazon advertised that Kindle books were available on all platforms</a> Apple forced the bookseller to stop selling books in its app. Moreover, Amazon couldn&#8217;t even <em>tell</em> users to visit Amazon.com, much less offer a link or, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apple-app-store-follow-up-aws-arm-servers-intels-impending-choice/">as Android allows</a>, a webview of the store.</p>
<p>What is troubling about this example, which also applies to Netflix, Spotify, and other so-called &#8220;Reader&#8221; apps, is that Apple&#8217;s aggressive integration up the stack isn&#8217;t really helping anyone. Users are confused, these big developers get fewer customers than they might have otherwise, while Apple&#8217;s overall iPhone experience is degraded. The ones that really lose out, though, are smaller developers whose cost structures cannot support Apple&#8217;s 30% cut, yet don&#8217;t have the brand awareness to enable customers to find their websites. In this way Apple is actually making dominant companies even stronger (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/">much like they are Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Apple also appears to be making an effort to limit this exception; while Basecamp managed to drive Apple to a face-saving retreat from its insistence on in-app purchase for its Hey email service, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/">I heard from many developers</a> that App Store review had started rejecting apps that had been in the store for years because they only allowed users to subscribe on the web.</p>
<p>What was particularly disappointing about these shakedowns, though, is that Apple itself admitted <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-reveals-new-developer-technologies-to-foster-the-next-generation-of-apps/">in a press release</a> that it had been holding up bug fixes in App Review &#8220;over guideline violations&#8221;, many of which were about driving usage of its own payment processor. This is truly an inversion of the win-win-win dynamic that characterized the company&#8217;s previous integration efforts: now users were being put at risk for bugs developers were liable for because of arbitrary reasons related to Apple&#8217;s drive for Services revenue.</p>
<p>Of course Apple had long put users at risk in other ways; the company had turned a blind eye to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/dependent-digital-whales/">the search for digital whales</a> who would spend huge amounts of money on games they could never win. This was, in retrospect, the canary in the coal mine about the corrupting power of the App Store: Apple had started out bragging how they would protect users, but the company seemed far more concerned about protecting its bottom line.</p>
<p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple&#8217;s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn&#8217;t support traditional trials<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/#footnote_2_5217" id="identifier_2_5217" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You can trial a subscription only">3</a> or upgrades, the importance of which I&#8217;ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>For me this is the biggest disappointment. I have long believed that the Internet is going to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">fundamentally remake all aspects of society</a>, including the economy, and that one area of immense promise is small-scale entrepreneurship. The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p>
<p>All that noted, what does remain valuable is Apple&#8217;s total control of the installation process. The iPhone is probably the most valuable target on earth for scams and hackers, and while <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/">vulnerabilities have been exploited</a>, there is no denying the fact that users are safer on iOS than they are on other platforms, and that is valuable to everyone involved.</p>
<h4>The Epic Lawsuit</h4>
<p>All of this explains why I find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">Epic&#8217;s lawsuit against Apple</a>, which was filed last Thursday after the company updated Fortnite to include an alternate payment system, and was promptly kicked out of the store by Apple, such a bummer.</p>
<p>Epic is attacking every level of the iPhone stack: the company doesn&#8217;t just want a direct relationship with customers, and it doesn&#8217;t just want to use its own payment processor; it is also demanding the right to run its own App Store. There is precedence on the PC: there Epic has built a rival to Steam that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">has benefited gamers most of all</a>; at the same time, the PC has always been completely open, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>My preferred outcome would see Apple maintaining its control of app installation. I treasure and depend on the openness of PCs and Macs, but I am also relieved that the iPhone is so dependable for those less technically savvy than me. What would be a far better outcome, at least from my perspective, would be Apple remembering that those same users that benefit from the iPhone being locked down should be the focus everywhere.</p>
<p>That means, for example, allowing purchases via webviews, particularly for products and experiences that do not have zero marginal costs. Sure, that could mean less App Store revenue in the short run, but Apple would be well-served having to build more and better products to win developers over. At the end of the day, squeezing businesses that can stomach the cost of Apple development, both in terms of implementing in-app purchase and that 30%, by definition has less ultimate upside than growing the pie for everyone.</p>
<p>This lawsuit is also a reminder that Apple has a lot to lose. While the most likely outcome is an Apple victory — the Supreme Court has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-response-to-hey-heys-response-to-apple-heys-limited-antitrust-options/">pretty consistent</a> in holding that companies do not have a &#8220;duty to deal&#8221; — every decision the company makes that favors only itself, and not society generally, is an invitation to examine just how important the iPhone is to, well, everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the most frustrating aspect of this debate: Apple consistently acts like a company peeved it is not getting its fair share, somehow ignoring the fact it is worth nearly $2 trillion precisely because the iPhone matters more than anything. This is not a console you play to entertain yourself, or even a PC for work: it is the foundation of modern life, which makes it all the more disappointing that Apple seems to care more about its short term bottom line than it does about the users and developers that used to share in its integration upside; if Apple doesn&#8217;t change course, hyperessential will at some point trump hypercompetitive.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/apple-tv-plus-subscribers-get-cbs-all-access-and-showtime-bundle-at-a-great-value/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the first bundle offer</a> that&rsquo;s ever been available for channels in the company&rsquo;s TV app. It comes with a unique twist in that the offer is only available for customers who already subscribe to Apple TV+, whether through a paid subscription or as part of their free year of service for purchasing a new Apple product. Apple TV+ subscribers can now subscribe to a bundle of CBS All Access and SHOWTIME for just $9.99 per month following a 7-day free trial. When subscribed to separately, these two channels together would cost $20.98 per month, making this a substantial offer.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple&rsquo;s press release highlights some of the features that make channel subscriptions appealing:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  By subscribing through Apple TV channels, customers can watch content from all three services online and offline, ad-free and on demand, only on the Apple TV app. Through Family Sharing, up to six family members can share the subscriptions to Apple TV+, CBS All Access, and SHOWTIME using just their personal Apple ID and password.

<p id="p5">As someone who has used Apple&rsquo;s TV app heavily for years, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-tv-channels-a-great-tv-experience-thats-failing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">written before</a> about how much value I find in the channels experience, and how disappointed I am that Apple hasn&rsquo;t been able to strike more deals for additional channels partners. When Apple TV channels first launched in early 2019, HBO was the most prestigious channel available, but when that service transitioned to become HBO Max, there was no longer a channel option available for Apple users. New streaming services like Disney+ and Peacock haven&rsquo;t been made available as channels either. So Apple has built a solid TV experience for the streaming age, but it&rsquo;s not available for the services people care about most. I&rsquo;m not particularly hopeful that today&rsquo;s bundle news will change that at all, but it&rsquo;s good to at least see a little life from the company&rsquo;s channels initiative.</p>

    <p>It’s 2020, and Apple is shipping a <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1219299028791226368">rack-mountable Mac Pro</a>. It’s the latest chapter in a decades-long flirtation between Apple and the machines that dwell in the server closet. Even though the Mac Pro is rack-mountable, Apple can’t quite see it as a server—<a href="https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1217136324219568128">you can’t buy it without a mouse and keyboard</a>. Instead, the company seems content to let individual users and dedicated third parties like MacStadium do the work of taking Mac workstations and treating them like they belong in a server rack.</p>
<p>This is a subject that’s close to my heart. I’ve only had my name on a single printed book and it was called “<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/providing-internet-services-via-the-mac-os/oclc/34243972">Providing Internet Services via the Mac OS</a>,” and told you everything you needed to know to turn a Mac running Classic Mac OS into a server. (Yes, that was a thing that we did back then.) From the mid-90s through the early 2000s, I had a series of Macs running classic Mac OS in my closet that acted as web, email, FTP, and database servers. Here’s to the crazy ones, I guess.</p>
<p>Apple has always been a consumer hardware company through and through, not a company that makes servers or speaks to an audience of IT people and network managers. But that hasn’t stopped it from trying. In the ’90s, Apple would rebadge Power Macs as Apple Workgroup Servers, bundling them with extra hardware and software.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Shiner. (Not a Mac.)</figcaption></figure><p>I started covering Apple in the mid-90s, and let me tell you, that particular version of Apple was extremely weird, as epitomized by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsVAdrdkyoA">Apple Network Server</a>, code-named Shiner.</p>
<p>Shiner was not a Mac. Shiner was a PowerPC-based server that cost between $11,000 and $15,000, and ran IBM’s version of UNIX known as AIX—which you needed to buy separately, for an additional $1,600. It was delayed several times, as its competitive advantage over PCs running Novell NetWare continued to dissipate. Robert Hess of MacWEEK wrote in 1995 that Apple had “missed its window of opportunity.” Reviews were positive, but tempered with a skepticism (later proven right) that Apple would actually commit to making a line of Unix-based servers.</p>
<p>Like most mid-90s Apple products, Shiner was killed off in 1997 as Apple was gripped by its near-death experience. “I look at that as a dream when Apple was in a coma,” Steve Jobs later said, while insisting that what would come next would be entirely different.</p>
<p>In fact,  the arrival of Jobs actually planted the seed of Apple’s next attempt to fit in a server rack: NextStep, the operating system that would evolve into Mac OS X, was based on Unix. The door was open for a Mac to be a real live Unix-based server and it took Apple almost no time to build its own server hardware.</p>
<p>It was OS X. On a server. It was Xserve. Pronounced like the letter, not the roman numeral. No, I don’t know why. Apple did stuff like that back in 2002.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06-xserve_front.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Steve Jobs and Jony Ive era of Apple was a design heyday when Apple created many interesting, clever, and influential products. The Xserve was… not that. It was most definitely the sign of a design team trying to figure out how to add some flair and creativity to a place—the server rack—that did not care one bit about either of those.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08-xserve_rack.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve was designed to live in the server rack.</figcaption></figure><p>Sized specifically for server racks, it was what’s called a 1U server, meaning it was a single unit high—so 1.75 inches thick, to go with the dimensions of a 19-inch equipment rack. Those dimensions are unusually large for a Mac: 18 inches wide and 28 inches deep. This was not a pizza box. This was an extra-extra-large, party-size pizza box.</p>
<p>Apple has frequently struggled between its instinct to create beautiful designs and designs that make its products more functional. Some of Apple’s worst design missteps have come because looks were prioritized over usability. (Feel free to think of your favorite example now. I’m imagining a round Mac Pro and an ultra-thin keyboard with no key travel.)</p>
<p>Xserve, then, was a real design challenge. How do you take pride in creating something for a server rack, the most utilitarian of environments? I’m not here to tell you Xserve was pretty, because it wasn’t. But it’s clear Apple’s designers struggled mightily to give it a little extra something.</p>
<p>The pretty stuff was on the front—fitting, since that’s really the only part you could see. There were shiny buttons, a FireWire 400 port, a slimline CD-ROM drive, and four hot-swappable hard drive modules. Press the front of a module and once the drive dismounted, a light appeared, indicating it was safe to remove the disk.</p>
<p>The back side featured a standard array of ports for the time, room for ports from three expansion cards, and the notably weird PC-standard DB-9 serial port. The idea was that you could connect to the Xserve and gain command-line access via serial, even if it wasn’t on your network. It’s a choice that makes sense for a server, but it’s pretty wacky for a Mac.</p>
<p>There was so much room inside that Xserve case that Apple designed it with two fans. The idea was that if one fan became less capable, the other fan would adjust to compensate—and if you needed to swap a fan out, you could do so without shutting the computer down.</p>
<p>Those fans are another of the Xserve’s unusual qualities: This is undoubtedly, indisputably the loudest Mac ever made. If people thought they could tuck these in a server rack in their quiet studio space, they were wrong… those fans <em>howled</em>. This was a server designed to be put away in a closet or server installation.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-xserveraid_3q.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Xserve RAID.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xserve also inspired the creation of one of Apple’s most unusual Mac accessories this side of the Duo Dock: The Xserve RAID. This was a 3U high 14-disk hard drive array with a design to match the Xserve.</p>
<p>The early 2000s were an era when Apple was so excited by the prospect of Mac OS X’s Unix underpinnings that it designed a rack-mountable Mac server and a 14-disk RAID system. “We have a lot to learn, but I think we’re going to learn fast, and learn by working with some great customers,” Jobs said on the day of the Xserve’s unveiling. But by the end of the decade it was clear that this was an area best served by other companies—not Apple.</p>
<p>Over the decades, Apple’s instinct for identifying the core of its business has been good, but there have been exceptions at the fringes. It created Aperture thinking it would take on Adobe for the high-end photography market… and then thought better of it.</p>
<p>Xserve is a similar example. The company saw a niche market where it could make something cooler and better and more cutting edge. But every other strategic decision Apple made during that era was in the service of its core business of making personal computers. Xserve survived eight years, including the transition to Intel, but it could not have been a hard decision for Apple to discontinue it and steer people who needed Mac servers to the Mac Pro and Mac mini.</p>
<p>Mac servers never died. They’re still all over the place, operated by people who are more comfortable with macOS than the alternatives. I’ve had a Mac mini running as a server in my house since the first one arrived on the scene. And yes, that rack-mountable Mac Pro is now available.</p>
<p>But the Xserve will always stand alone. It was the only Mac made specifically for that equipment rack. I’d ask for us to take a moment of silence to remember it, but you wouldn’t be able to hear yourself think over the fan noise.</p>

    <p>In my COVID-19 chart roundup this morning you may have noticed a tiny uptick in Italy&#8217;s mortality numbers. I thought about mentioning it, but decided to wait a few days to see if it was just a blip. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-shutters-nightclubs-mandates-masks-as-coronavirus-case-numbers-rise-again/2020/08/17/24e5e2e4-e066-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_virusitaly-1045a%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">Apparently it&#8217;s not:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With daily coronavirus case numbers rising,</strong> Italy on Monday imposed its first new restrictions on daily life since coming out of lockdown nearly four months ago, ordering the closure of nightclubs and mandating mask-wearing, even outdoors, in areas with nightlife&#8230;.Although the Italian restrictions are modest, they amount to a test of whether a country can keep the virus at bay without resorting to the blunt-force lockdown strategy used earlier in the pandemic. Italy’s government is specifically targeting nightclubs and evening socializing as cases are increasingly detected among the young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, case counts have been rising for the past several weeks:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859580"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859580" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_italy_cases_august_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="616"></figure>
<p>The number of new daily cases has nearly tripled since early July. This is an early test of whether countries can <em>ever</em> come out of lockdown and remain safe until we have an effective vaccine. It&#8217;s not looking good so far.</p>

    <p>Though it might still only be mid-August, fall is rapidly approaching. That’s not only significant because it will hopefully mean the end of the heat that’s been barraging my home for the last several weeks, but also because it’s traditionally Apple’s busiest time of the year.</p>
<p>I say “traditionally” because this year, well, everything’s a little bit off-kilter. Still, it does seem as though the Cupertino-based company is getting its ducks in a row for its usual deluge of product releases, even if the actual event might look more like this year’s WWDC keynote than fall Apple events of years past.</p>
<p>So, in advance of everything kicking off, let’s take a moment to go over what might be the most exciting announcements to come out of Apple Park in the next few months, and what we all might have to look forward to. (Because, in this day and age, we all need <em>something</em> to look forward to, don’t we?)</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3571456/whats-in-store-and-in-stores-for-apple-this-fall.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

I didn’t ask the clerk at Barnes &amp; Noble what channel she watched the speech on her new TV. It was none of my business, like a bunch of other things that were none of my business when she sold me my copy of<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Harris’ memoir.</a> The important thing to her was that she had a new TV.</span></h5>
<p>The clerk who rang up my copy of Kamala Harris’ memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-truths-we-hold-kamala-harris/1129054207?ean=9780525560739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Truths We Hold”</a>, was a short, thin, white woman about my age, with wire framed glasses, dark graying hair haphazardly pinned back from her heart shaped face, her eyes smiling brightly over her surgical blue cloth mask. Her eyes got brighter as she slid the book under the plexiglass. “Did you see her speech?”</p>
<p>Her tone suggested she had and it had made her an enthusiastic Harris fan, if she wasn’t one already. It also suggested I must be one too. Why else would I be buying the book?</p>
<p>“I saw part of it. I came in late,” I said regretfully. I didn’t get into the problems I’d had getting it to stream on my computer. “I heard the best part was the beginning when she talked about her friendship with Beau.”</p>
<p>She assured me it was a nice tribute. I told her I hadn’t known they were friends. If I had I would have believed she was a lock for the nomination. “I don’t much about him,” she said apologetically. I resisted the temptation to mansplain the man. I said, &quot;I think there&#39;s a section in the book dealing with him and their friendship,&quot; and left it at that. She said she looked forward to reading it. I asked for her impression of the whole speech but it turned out there was something she was more excited about than the speech itself---that <em>she had been able to watch it.</em> “I just got a TV!” she practically burbled. “It’s my first.”</p>
<p>This threw me a bit. A fellow boomer and it’s her first TV? I went quickly through the possibilities. She meant it was the first TV that was all her own? All her previous TVs she’d shared with her family, roommates, partner or spouse? That raised questions about her living arrangements and what became of the “owner” of the old TV, questions that were none of my business. Or was she one of those people who had not wanted a TV or hadn’t been able to afford one when she’d set out on her own and found she got along fine without one? So then, why had she decided to get one now? Had she inherited it? From whom and under what circumstances? Again, not my business. So I said, “Just in time for the convention.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait!” she said.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope it’s all good news from here on out.”</p>
<p>“If it’s not,” she said, still cheerful but with a note of steely determination, “it’s going right back!”</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-16/postal-service-cutbacks-spur-fear-of-election-havoc">Now we&#8217;re talking:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spurred by fears that President Trump is trying to eviscerate the U.S. Postal Service to help him win reelection, <strong>Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday abruptly summoned the House back to Washington this week</strong> to pass a bill aimed at rolling back administration cutbacks that could cripple widespread mail-in voting. Congressional Democrats also called on the recently appointed postmaster general to testify Aug. 24 at an emergency hearing by a House committee about cost-cutting moves that led to steep slowdowns in mail service in much of the country over the last three months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an area where good politics and good policy come together. The Postal Service really does need higher funding, especially this year, and this is a very popular position since practically everyone loves the post office. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Republicans being willing to take a beating over this for months on end, especially since it&#8217;s unlikely to actually make a big difference in the election results anyway. Donald Trump is too stupid to know this, but most Republican leaders know it perfectly well.</p>

<p>&#8230;.‘The citizens of United States are being denied access to food. This is a war crime! <strong>This is crimes against humanity happening right now at Mother&#8217;s Market &amp; Kitchen in Costa Mesa!’</strong> the narrator continues.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Joseph Gordon Leavitt as Edward Snowden - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Joseph Gordon Leavitt as Edward Snowden - Edited" /></a></p>
<h5>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Ed Snowden, the computer analyst and programmer who exposed the U.S. government&#39;s mass surveillance of American citizens , wearing an expression as blank and unreadable as the movie he’s starring in often is itself, Oliver Stone’s untypically understated, uncharacteristically romantic &quot;Snowden&quot;.</h5>
<p>Trump’s talking about pardoning Edward Snowden. As usual, it’s hard to know if he means it, or if it’s just something to get attention, or he’s trying to distract his voters from all the bad news they might be hearing about their hero-king. And there’s the question of who put the idea in his head and why now? Something else we’re hearing he’s been saying to aides is that he wants to meet with Putin before the election. Maybe Putin said something. Like “Please take this bore off our hands. We’re tired of paying his rent.” Whatever’s going on, it started me thinking about Snowden’s case and about him and reconsidering both. I’m a grudging admirer of Snowden. I don’t see him as either a hero or a martyr, but I don’t see him as a traitor and a villain either. I see him as the victim of his own naivete and his peculiar ideology, someone who wanted to do the right thing but didn’t really have a clear idea what the right thing was or how to go about doing it, done in by hubris and folly, an anti-hero in an ironic tragedy of his own making. But the image I have of him is in a large part drawn from Oliver Stone’s movie “Snowden” and Stone, to put it mildly, is often done in by his own peculiar ideology and hubris. So I should do some homework, including re-reading Snowden’s memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/permanent-record-edward-snowden/1132756213?ean=9781250772909&amp;aug=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Permanent Record”</a>, before I come to any new conclusions. In the meantime, I feel like it’s an opportune time to re-post my review of the movie, which I liked for the performances of its leads and supporting characters not so much for the movie itself---I thought Stone pulled his punches, something Stone isn’t known for doing. “Snowden” has more in common with more conventionally told, understated historical thrillers like “The Good Shepherd” or “American Sniper” than with “Nixon” or “JFK”, and what’s the point of going to an Oliver Stone movie if you’re not going to be punched in the face?</p>
<p>By the way, I left my favorite performance out of the review because I didn’t want to spoil the surprise of Nic Cage’s cameo. After four years, I think you’re allowed to include spoilers…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">_________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasn’t looking forward to seeing &quot;Snowden&quot;. With apologies to <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-oliver-stone-experience-matt-zoller-seitz/1123120241?ean=9781419717901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matt Zoller Seitz</a>, I’m not much of an Oliver Stone fan. I find his movies too...loud. And insistent. And he&#39;s too much of a believer in the idea of the Last Honest Man. I feel like all his movies tend to be about how one noble and innocent man, after temporarily losing his way, redeems himself by taking on and defeating the SYSTEM or in being defeated by it.</p>
<p>Of course that’s not entirely true. At any rate, it’s not true of &quot;Nixon&quot;.</p>
<p>But &quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, even &quot;Talk Radio&quot; fit the pattern. I probably could make the case that &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is his own dark parody of the same theme.</p>
<p>And hand in glove with the Last Honest Man theme is Stone’s vision of America as a generally dark and sinister place ruled by a shadowy and corrupt elite made up of ruthless and power-hungry schemers, thieves, mass murderers, and madmen, and in that &quot;Nixon&quot; does fit the pattern. Richard Nixon and Nixon’s America are the implicit or explicit evils at work in all those other movies.</p>
<p>There are too many days when I agree with Stone on this and it’s one of the things I go to the movies to escape, that grim, cynical, despairing sense that Nixon won.</p>
<p>So I was expecting more of the same from &quot;Snowden&quot;. But it wasn’t just the existential dread I was dreading.</p>
<p>I was dreading that Stone would try to make a hero of Edward Snowden, and I just can’t bring myself to think of Snowden as a hero.</p>
<p>This says more about my own orneriness than about anything else. I think a lot of liberals need to see Snowden as a hero the way a lot of conservatives needed to see Chris Kyle as a hero. And I want no part of that. They’re both too complicated, flawed, and all too human. I’ve always seen Snowden as an idealistic and well-meaning but naive young man who tried to do a good thing, by his lights, and did it badly in a way that ended up screwing himself and tainting his cause.</p>
<p>I’ve also never been sure exactly what good he hoped to do or how much good he actually accomplished.</p>
<p>I don’t know which side in the debate to trust. The government’s argument has been we need to do what we’re doing in order to stop the terrorists but don’t worry we’re not overstepping, which is not the kind of reassurance the government should expect people to just accept. What government has ever not overstepped? And no evidence that spying on everybody worked or that it was necessary. It didn’t help get bin Laden and the major terrorist threats that we know failed---the shoe bomb that didn’t go off, the underwear bomb that didn’t go off, the Times Square bomb that didn’t go off---were thwarted mainly by accident and the terrorists’ own incompetence.</p>
<p>On the other side, the argument seemed to be that nothing the government did to protect us was worth the assault on our civil rights and privacy---brave words, but seemed to me to come out of a sense that there was nothing to protect us from.</p>
<p>I figured I’d sit through the movie feeling as frustrated and manipulated and pulled in too many directions by the story Stone was telling as I’d felt by the real story as I heard it told in the news and online all along.</p>
<p>Didn’t seem like a fun way to spend a couple hours.</p>
<p>In the end I felt I had to go so I could write about it in order to maintain my standing as a dutiful liberal blogger. In other words, I went as homework. Not the best reason to go to a movie.</p>
<p>Turned out it wasn’t the kind of Oliver Stone movie I was dreading. It wasn’t loud. It was even nuanced. And parts of it were quite...sweet.</p>
<p>A nice surprise, at the beginning. By the midway point, though, I was wishing it was more of that kind of Oliver Stone movie simply because that would have been more exciting and fun. As it is, &quot;Snowden&quot; is as low-key, reticent, unforthcoming, emotionally reserved to the point of repressed, and monotonous as its portrayal of Edward Snowden himself.</p>
<p>But...while in many ways it still is a typical Oliver Stone movie, including its being about another Last Honest Man, whether or not it’s a typical Oliver Stone movie and whether or not I’m an Oliver Stone fan doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan and &quot;Snowden&quot; features what’s becoming a typically excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance.</p>
<p>An excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance doesn’t mean an excellent movie. It just means a movie that’s at least worth watching for Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s performance.</p>
<p>Gordon-Levitt’s Snowden is watchful, self-contained, maybe not emotionally repressed but definitely willfully undemonstrative. He rarely seems to smile on his own volition. A smile is a reflexive reaction he should have controlled. When he’s made to smile---and it’s always as if been made to, against his will and better judgement---there’s a look in his eye that’s partly regret and partly amused admiration for whatever or whoever’s forced him to smile, as if he’s been fooled by a card trick he should have known better than to fall for but he still can’t help enjoying the trick and having been tricked in spite of himself. And talks openly only a little more often than he smiles. He says only what he has to say. He has a vibrant inner life but he’s determined to keep it to himself. He’s an intellectual and a voracious reader. He thinks deeply and philosophically about what he reads. But you have to work hard to get him to talk about it. You have to work hard to get him to talk, period. When he does speak it’s with a slight, barely perceptible hesitation, and with a studying look in his eyes, as if he’s scouting the path a sentence is going to take for holes to avoid stepping in and roots to avoid tripping over. It’s as if he’s hooked himself up to an inner lie detector test to ensure that everything he’s about to say---and feel---is truthful and accurate. A conversation style that cuts down on small talk. That’s the point. Talking just for the sake of talking is when you’re likely to give yourself away.</p>
<p>Not that Snowden has anything to hide---when we first meet him, at any rate. He’s not deceitful. He’s not particularly shy, either, and not naturally taciturn. His reticence is more like a point of principle. His business is his business, and yours is yours. He’s the living embodiment of the principle he’s ultimately going to ruin his life defending. No one gets to pry into anyone else’s life without explicit, specific, and limited permission.</p>
<p>Conversations should be about practical matters at hand, and he’s not just willing but eager to talk about those. He’ll gladly go into detail about what he’s working on---if you have the security clearance and he’s judged you smart enough and competent enough to follow him. He just won’t tell you why he’s working on it and for whom he’s doing the work.</p>
<p>Temperamentally, intellectually, emotionally, and, as it turns out, politically and ideologically he’s suited for working for the NSA and the CIA, which is to say essentially as a spy and an eager volunteer in the cyberwar on terror. Edward Snowden, I was surprised to learn, was a Republican and a libertarian when he started out in the intelligence business.</p>
<p>The problem, he learns to his own dismay, is that the nature of the work he has to do, and wants to do, and is proud to do and be able to do, is in conflict with his own nature.</p>
<p>As it happens, at this critical point in his life he falls in love with someone who in her own way is as all wrong for him as it’s becoming clear his job is all wrong for him.</p>
<p>His job requires him to treat everyone else’s business--and it’s literally everyone else’s business---as his business. Being in love with the politically liberal artist and professional free-spirit Lindsay Mills, played charmingly, exuberantly, and winsomely---but not too winsomely ---by Shailene Woodley, means allowing his business to become her business and through her the business of everyone else or, at any rate, anyone else she whimsically decides to share it with it and, given her nature, that could mean literally everyone else.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Along Came Lindsay Joseph Gordon Leavitt and Shailene Woodley as Ed Snowden and Lindsay Mills - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d-640wi" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Along Came Lindsay Joseph Gordon Leavitt and Shailene Woodley as Ed Snowden and Lindsay Mills - Edited" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If Snowden’s motto is “Nothing about me is your business”, hers is “Everything about me is not only your business but something I expect you’ll find totally fascinating.”</p>
<p>Good liberal that she is, she isn’t the least bit worried about the government’s spying on her or on anybody because she not only doesn’t have anything incriminating to hide, she doesn’t hide anything. She puts her whole life online, practically uploading her soul and personality, a virtual her who’s even more open and free-spirited and uninhibited as the analog her.</p>
<p>She’s an exhibitionist. Her whole life is a work of performance art. Multi-talented, her art of the moment is photography and she’s using her camera to chronicle her life. Snowden, as an important part of her life, is an important part of the chronicle. He must be photographed. Continually. He’s her favorite model. She adores him as a person so she adores him as a subject. He has to perform for her. For her camera, at any rate. He has to smile. And despite himself, he does. He even begins to enjoy it, both smiling and performing for her.</p>
<p>So, even though at first glance in one way she’s all wrong for him, she’s in this way just right for him. She frees him up to be more himself. She brings him out of himself, gets him out and about in the world, shows him how to have fun and enjoy what life offers beyond work. It’s the old, old story going back to Pride and Prejudice. Creative and intelligent and passionate free-spirited young woman finds true love and happiness by saving a dour, emotionally repressed, all work and no play from himself and the stodgy, conventional boring life he’s headed for. It’s an old story but a good story.</p>
<p>Trouble is it’s usually a funny story.</p>
<p>&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a comedy. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, another version, is a farce. Buried in &quot;Snowden&quot; is a comedy that could be called &quot;Along Came Lindsay&quot;. Ed Snowden is a Mister Darcy who’s a genius computer programmer addicted to his work. Lindsay Mills is an Elizabeth Bennett who takes nude selfies and posts them on the internet. They get together, despite themselves, and live happily if somewhat complicatedly ever after.</p>
<p>This would be fine if only the story around them had also been a comedy. It could have been one too, if Stone had chosen to see it that way. There is something farcical about the government’s “Let’s spy on everybody!” plan to combat terror. And the character who serves as the movie’s central villain, a CIA operative named O’Brian and Snowden’s suave and sophisticated but sinister mentor, brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans, is in essence a comic villain.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-pi"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-640wi" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" /></a></p>
<p>With his long lupine face topped off by snow white hair combed boyishly forward, he looks like Draco Malfoy whom no one has told is now middle-aged and a lot less pretty than he was when he and Harry Potter last crossed wands---an effect probably emphasized in my mind by Gordon-Levitt’s looking as though the part of Snowden was between him and Daniel Radcliffe and Stone told him he’d only cast him if he played it as a grown-up and grown Severus Snape-grim Harry. O’Brian’s improbable hair cut hints at the man’s vanity as well as his phoniness.</p>
<p>Feeling professionally obligated to keep his true self hidden and to appear in the world in disguise, he’s chosen for his primary false identity to disguise himself as someone twenty years younger. In another of his guises, he’s a Hemingwayesque outdoorsman and hunter. (For this one he wears a Stetson that looks as improbable on him as the haircut.) He’s also, at various times, a <em>bon vivant</em> and man of the world and a country club-style hale fellow well met type of 19th hole regular as gregarious and sycophantic as if he’s congratulating business contacts he’s let beat him at golf. (This one seems to be real in that it’s something he really does as part of his spy craft.)</p>
<p>The role he plays most often with Snowden is that of wise to the ways of the world and magic wizard instructing an apprentice, Merlin to Snowden’s Arthur, Dumbledore to Harry, Obi-wan---the haircut is also reminiscent of Alec Guinness’s wig in the original Star Wars movies---to his Luke.</p>
<p>All of these disguises are self-flattering and self-aggrandizing and there’s comedy to be found in his inflated view of himself. But it’s also a wonder that he can keep them all straight and doesn’t occasionally play the wrong part at the wrong time for the wrong audience and that could have been funny, his getting mixed up from time to time. A few more good jokes and with Stone pushing him to ham it up a bit more---or giving him permission to. Ifans probably wouldn’t have needed much prodding or direction. He is British, after all, (Well, Welsh, technically, but so was Burton) and the Brits are taught how to be hams as part of their basic training as actors.---and O’Brian would have been a funny bad guy.</p>
<p>But even though there are funny moments in &quot;Snowden&quot;, Stone doesn’t find any of the larger story amusing. That’s one of the reasons I’m not a fan. There’s never much he finds amusing. That’s ok, though. Not all love stories are comedies. Young lovers who would have had happy endings if only the grown-ups had stayed out of it are regularly in story and song brought to sorrow and grief. (See &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.) For stretches of the movie, it looks as though that’s what’s going to happen to Snowden and Mills. His work is going to break them up, break their spirits, and break their hearts. There’s even a tragic flaw within their love for each other that would have helped that to happen.</p>
<p>As good as she is for him in one way, she’s bad for him in another, because, despite her being a liberal hippie in comparison to him, she’s a spoiled rich girl used to living well and traveling in the “right” social circles. His job allows for both and she likes that.</p>
<p>As O’Brian’s protege he’s invited into the homes of the Beltway elite where he meets and is taken a shine to by important and Very Serious People who are happy to boost his career. When he gives up government work only to go back to work for the government as a consultant, his salary jumps and he and Mills are suddenly very flush with money. At first, Snowden’s not impressed by either the money or the social advancement. But he is impressed by how it makes her happy. And, under her influence, he begins to like it too, both the money and the social success.</p>
<p>On top of this, Mills is a bit of a vicarious thrill-seeker and she pushes him to go out into the field and do some actual spying.</p>
<p>This leads to what I think is the best section of &quot;Snowden&quot;, almost a movie within the movie that could have been expanded into the plot of an entire Hitchcockinan thriller focused wholly Snowden and Mills as a pair of innocents caught up in intrigue and adventure.</p>
<p>Snowden is sent to Austria---setting of &quot;The Third Man&quot;---where he teams up with a charming but oily, hedonistic, and morally bankrupt operative, played by a leering and cheerfully dissolute Timothy Olyphant to manipulate an innocent banker into giving them information about a would-be terrorist. The banker isn’t connected to the terrorist himself. He has family connections who have connections to people who have connections to people who...you get the picture. He himself has no idea how he’s connected at such a remove, but Snowden and his partner get to those connections through his daughter. This leads to tragedy and Snowden’s first serious crisis of conscience.</p>
<p>There Stone had a story, if he’d wanted to tell it, about a pair of lovers who are tempted by money, status, and the pure thrill of behaving amorally and either fall into corruption or are saved from it by their own innate decency or the intervention of angels in human form, a tragedy or a comedy, whichever way he chose. He chose to go back to his main story about Snowden standing up to the System. That could have been a tragedy or a comedy too. Except for one hitch. Neither the tragedy nor the comedy happen because neither did happen.</p>
<p>You’d think that wouldn’t have been a problem for him since what really happened has never stopped him before from telling the story he wanted to tell and making the points he was determined to make.</p>
<p>But this time it did. Stone let himself be blocked by reality.</p>
<p>The real Snowden and Mills seem to be living out a romantic comedy. Who knows if they’ll live happily ever after, but from all appearances they’re living pretty happily in the here and now, despite the inconvenience of their Russian exile, a fate, by the way, the movie comes close to blaming on the Glenn Greenwald, the activist and blogger and columnist for the Guardian who advised Snowden at the time he decided to go public with what he knew about the mass surveillance and release the data he’d according to the law stolen from the U.S. Government. I’ll get to that in another post. The System gets taken down and Snowden and Mills survive as individuals and as a couple and Stone is left with a love story that’s neither comic nor tragic, just kind of sweet, interrupted too often by a not particularly dramatic historical drama.</p>
<p>Again, there’s a way he could have dealt with this. The one I suggested earlier. He could have the plot that surrounds the romance a comedy too or, at least, comedic.</p>
<p>For reasons I can only guess at, he didn’t do that. But then he didn’t do what I’d actually expected him to do. Treat the whole thing as a typical Oliver Stone overwrought melodrama.</p>
<p>There’s a surprising matter-of-factness to his storytelling in &quot;Snowden&quot;. A this happened, then this happened, then that happened straight-forwardness that not only cuts down on the suspense but causes the movie to resist emotional involvement.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to feel about all of this?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be a bit of a shrug.</p>
<p>Feel?</p>
<p>Ok. Then how about think? What are we supposed to think?</p>
<p>Another shrug.</p>
<p>I was dreading going to &quot;Snowden&quot; because I expected Stone would try to be as emotionally manipulative and intellectually dishonest---in the cause of dragging the audience to the right side---as he’s often been. I didn’t want to be imaginatively wrestled into taking Snowden’s side and cheering him on as a hero. But I think I would have enjoyed that better.</p>
<p>Stone seems to be way too willing to let the facts speak for themselves for once. In truth, he seems barely interested in presenting the facts at all. At any rate, he doesn’t do much to dramatize them, let alone over-dramatize them in keeping with what I’ve always thought is his idiom. He appears to take it for granted we know all we need to know about the government’s massive data gathering enterprises and that we disapprove on intellectual, constitutional, and moral grounds, and he doesn’t have to work to make us disapprove.</p>
<p>The result is some rather desultory storytelling with many confusing and lazy plot twists and turns. Details and events have to be left out, compressed, or elided in all historical movies for the sake of time and in order not to overwhelm the audience with facts as if in a well-meaning but counterproductive effort to help us cram for a final exam. But in &quot;Snowden&quot; those left-out details and events aren’t compensated for either imagistically or through poetic license. This happened, then that happened, then...this happened. Wait? What? How did we get to that last this happened? What happened during the ellipses?</p>
<p>We’ll have to go back and read the books.</p>
<p>As for Snowden and what good he did...or harm…</p>
<p>On this point, as with the other, Stone seems to take it for granted that since we already agree that what the government was doing was wrong on principle, then we already agree that what Snowden did to put a stop to it was right on principle, and therefore Snowden is a champion of truth, justice, and the American way, on principle, and we will cheer for him in the end, on principle.</p>
<p>I don’t like to go to movies on principle. I went to this one on the principle I needed to do my homework for the blog and I wasn’t looking forward to being manipulated. But I would rather be manipulated into cheering for the hero than being expected to do it on principle. And that’s what I missed most watching &quot;&quot;Snowden, Stone’s old manipulative tricks.</p>
<p>I missed his special pleadings. I missed his tampering with history and the histrionics that usually go with it. I missed his very dark view of America. The government as presented in &quot;Snowden&quot; is generally incompetent while being too competent at the wrong things, corrupt but only routinely so and mainly because individual actors are corrupt, and generally wrongheaded to the point of stupidity. Which is why I think it could have been treated comically. But it isn’t actively evil. And it isn’t anybody, really. President Obama appears in clips that show him saying things we now know were official lies. But that’s all they are, official lies of the sort any and all political leaders engage in as a matter of course. There’s no George W. Bush here, no Dick Cheney. I didn’t miss them, particularly. But I missed there being real villains.</p>
<p>Especially the chief villain of Stone’s dark vision.</p>
<p>I missed Nixon.</p>

<p><strong>Nerdy makers</strong><br />
As someone who makes things, I am very interested in new materials, cool ways to hack off-the-shelf products, and innovative techniques for constructing stuff. All these subjects are covered in an occasional free newsletter, <a href="https://wheelhouse.substack.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Wheelhouse</a>, written for nerdy makers. Wheelhouse also hosts a Discord community whose discussions generate content for the newsletter. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Superglue and baking soda for fixing broken plastic parts</strong><br />
My friend <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675949/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Bob</a> sent me this video about using <a href="https://youtu.be/2tHhW1XOm2U?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">super glue and baking soda to fix broken plastic parts</a>. When it cures it is rock hard. I used this material to repair a broken dimmer switch knob and it didn’t break when I intentionally tried to snap it between my hands. — MF</p>
<p><strong>How to comfort someone</strong><br />
I think being able to make someone feel better is a superpower and one that I often fail at when I go into problem-solving mode too soon. This article outlines “<a href="https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2020/07/29/The-Four-States-of-Distress-how-to-comfort-someone-when-something-bad-happens-to-them?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">The Four States of Distress</a>” — 1. Shocked. 2. Feeling bad and not wanting to feel better. 3. Ready to feel better. 4. Feeling better and needing solutions. — and suggests the most helpful actions you can take to comfort someone at each state. It also shines a light on “comfort languages,” and after some thought, I recognized my comfort language is having someone help me explore and understand my feelings (and distraction helps too!). — CD</p>
<p><strong>Super comfortable slippers I can wear outside</strong><br />
I rarely drive anywhere these days, and aside from taking walks a couple of times a day in the neighborhood, I’m sheltering in place. I decided to give my feet a break and I’m wearing slippers instead of shoes around the house. These $15 <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/rockdove-men-s-original-two-tone-memory-foam-slippers-dark-gray-blue-size-9-10?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">memory foam slippers from RockDove</a> have an open back that makes them easy to slip on and kick-off, and the memory foam insoles are incredibly comfortable. Importantly they have a thick waterproof sole, so I can wear them in the backyard. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Free music soundtracks for video</strong><br />
The secret sauce for successful film- and video-making is the audio. The easiest way to add a musical score and sound effects to home-made video, particularly if you will be uploading it to YouTube, is to use the large collection of license-free music and effects in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCht8qITGkBvXKsR1Byln-wA?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">YouTube Audio</a> library. It’s free. Many tracks are pretty good. And the music is guaranteed to be “clear” and not cause copyright or monetization issues on YouTube. I’ve been using them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLr3Q2Qayr1ANe72ystgWXp9j3qIYkRinJ&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;v=RPM6uXxPD-w" target="_blank">on my videos</a>. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Best contact solution</strong><br />
I’ve been a contact wearer for 20+ years and have always bought the cheapest, store brand cleaning solution on the shelf thinking they were all the same. I was forced to buy <a href="https://geni.us/usFoSH?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Opti-Free Puremoist with HydraGlyde</a> ($10, 10 fl oz) while I was on vacation and it was the only option, and I’m so happy I did, because they make my contacts feel like silk! The <a href="https://geni.us/pu5MXHG?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Puremoist Rewetting Drops</a> also help keep my contacts comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. — CD</p>

    <p>Donald Trump loves to fill vacant positions by simply appointing acting officials, thus bypassing the Senate confirmation process that he finds so annoying. Unfortunately for him, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/top-dhs-officials-wolf-cuccinelli-are-not-legally-eligible-serve-their-current-roles-congressional-watchdog-agency-finds/">that&#8217;s not always legal:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top two officials at the Department of Homeland Security are serving unlawfully in their roles, the Government Accountability Office said Friday, dealing a rebuke to President Trump’s affinity for filling senior executive roles in his administration with “acting” leaders who lack Senate confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good for the GAO, but how many divisions do they have? This is a president who&#8217;s deliberately wrecking the post office to gain a partisan advantage over Democrats. He sent domestic troops to Portland to create chaos that would help sell his law-and-order campaign theme. He&#8217;s pulled the birther card against Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and now Kamala Harris. He had protesters near the White House gassed so he could do a photo op. He pardons his pals even if they&#8217;ve committed crimes so obvious that even Bill Barr calls their prosecution righteous. He retweets lunatic QAnon conspiracies. He tried to get a foreign leader to open a criminal investigation of a political opponent. He has relentlessly tried to undermine the census. And he&#8217;s done all this stuff without a peep of protest from anyone in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So what are the odds that anyone will try to make him obey the law now? About zero, I think.</p>
