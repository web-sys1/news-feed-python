    <p>Acerbic YouTube take from Jim Sterling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screw the lot of them. Yes, Apple and Google need taking down from
their high towers. Yes, Epic Games has a point as it sues to keep
Fortnite on mobile devices. But absolutely all of them are as bad
as each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t my take, per se, but it’s a fair take.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><em><strong>Originally posted October 11, 2016. Resubmitted for reconsideration, Sunday morning, August 16, 2020.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Joseph Gordon Leavitt as Edward Snowden - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4bd7200c-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Joseph Gordon Leavitt as Edward Snowden - Edited" /></a></p>
<h5>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Ed Snowden, the computer analyst and programmer who exposed the U.S. government&#39;s mass surveillance of American citizens , wearing an expression as blank and unreadable as the movie he’s starring in often is itself, Oliver Stone’s untypically understated, uncharacteristically romantic &quot;Snowden&quot;.</h5>
<p>Trump’s talking about pardoning Edward Snowden. As usual, it’s hard to know if he means it, or if it’s just something to get attention, or he’s trying to distract his voters from all the bad news they might be hearing about their hero-king. And there’s the question of who put the idea in his head and why now? Something else we’re hearing he’s been saying to aides is that he wants to meet with Putin before the election. Maybe Putin said something. Like “Please take this bore off our hands. We’re tired of paying his rent.” Whatever’s going on, it started me thinking about Snowden’s case and about him and reconsidering both. I’m a grudging admirer of Snowden. I don’t see him as either a hero or a martyr, but I don’t see him as a traitor and a villain either. I see him as the victim of his own naivete and his peculiar ideology, someone who wanted to do the right thing but didn’t really have a clear idea what the right thing was or how to go about doing it, done in by hubris and folly, an anti-hero in an ironic tragedy of his own making. But the image I have of him is in a large part drawn from Oliver Stone’s movie “Snowden” and Stone, to put it mildly, is often done in by his own peculiar ideology and hubris. So I should do some homework, including re-reading Snowden’s memoir, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/permanent-record-edward-snowden/1132756213?ean=9781250772909&amp;aug=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Permanent Record”</a>, before I come to any new conclusions. In the meantime, I feel like it’s an opportune time to re-post my review of the movie, which I liked for the performances of its leads and supporting characters not so much for the movie itself---I thought Stone pulled his punches, something Stone isn’t known for doing. “Snowden” has more in common with more conventionally told, understated historical thrillers like “The Good Shepherd” or “American Sniper” than with “Nixon” or “JFK”, and what’s the point of going to an Oliver Stone movie if you’re not going to be punched in the face?</p>
<p>By the way, I left my favorite performance out of the review because I didn’t want to spoil the surprise of Nic Cage’s cameo. After four years, I think you’re allowed to include spoilers…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">_________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasn’t looking forward to seeing &quot;Snowden&quot;. With apologies to <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-oliver-stone-experience-matt-zoller-seitz/1123120241?ean=9781419717901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matt Zoller Seitz</a>, I’m not much of an Oliver Stone fan. I find his movies too...loud. And insistent. And he&#39;s too much of a believer in the idea of the Last Honest Man. I feel like all his movies tend to be about how one noble and innocent man, after temporarily losing his way, redeems himself by taking on and defeating the SYSTEM or in being defeated by it.</p>
<p>Of course that’s not entirely true. At any rate, it’s not true of &quot;Nixon&quot;.</p>
<p>But &quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, even &quot;Talk Radio&quot; fit the pattern. I probably could make the case that &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is his own dark parody of the same theme.</p>
<p>And hand in glove with the Last Honest Man theme is Stone’s vision of America as a generally dark and sinister place ruled by a shadowy and corrupt elite made up of ruthless and power-hungry schemers, thieves, mass murderers, and madmen, and in that &quot;Nixon&quot; does fit the pattern. Richard Nixon and Nixon’s America are the implicit or explicit evils at work in all those other movies.</p>
<p>There are too many days when I agree with Stone on this and it’s one of the things I go to the movies to escape, that grim, cynical, despairing sense that Nixon won.</p>
<p>So I was expecting more of the same from &quot;Snowden&quot;. But it wasn’t just the existential dread I was dreading.</p>
<p>I was dreading that Stone would try to make a hero of Edward Snowden, and I just can’t bring myself to think of Snowden as a hero.</p>
<p>This says more about my own orneriness than about anything else. I think a lot of liberals need to see Snowden as a hero the way a lot of conservatives needed to see Chris Kyle as a hero. And I want no part of that. They’re both too complicated, flawed, and all too human. I’ve always seen Snowden as an idealistic and well-meaning but naive young man who tried to do a good thing, by his lights, and did it badly in a way that ended up screwing himself and tainting his cause.</p>
<p>I’ve also never been sure exactly what good he hoped to do or how much good he actually accomplished.</p>
<p>I don’t know which side in the debate to trust. The government’s argument has been we need to do what we’re doing in order to stop the terrorists but don’t worry we’re not overstepping, which is not the kind of reassurance the government should expect people to just accept. What government has ever not overstepped? And no evidence that spying on everybody worked or that it was necessary. It didn’t help get bin Laden and the major terrorist threats that we know failed---the shoe bomb that didn’t go off, the underwear bomb that didn’t go off, the Times Square bomb that didn’t go off---were thwarted mainly by accident and the terrorists’ own incompetence.</p>
<p>On the other side, the argument seemed to be that nothing the government did to protect us was worth the assault on our civil rights and privacy---brave words, but seemed to me to come out of a sense that there was nothing to protect us from.</p>
<p>I figured I’d sit through the movie feeling as frustrated and manipulated and pulled in too many directions by the story Stone was telling as I’d felt by the real story as I heard it told in the news and online all along.</p>
<p>Didn’t seem like a fun way to spend a couple hours.</p>
<p>In the end I felt I had to go so I could write about it in order to maintain my standing as a dutiful liberal blogger. In other words, I went as homework. Not the best reason to go to a movie.</p>
<p>Turned out it wasn’t the kind of Oliver Stone movie I was dreading. It wasn’t loud. It was even nuanced. And parts of it were quite...sweet.</p>
<p>A nice surprise, at the beginning. By the midway point, though, I was wishing it was more of that kind of Oliver Stone movie simply because that would have been more exciting and fun. As it is, &quot;Snowden&quot; is as low-key, reticent, unforthcoming, emotionally reserved to the point of repressed, and monotonous as its portrayal of Edward Snowden himself.</p>
<p>But...while in many ways it still is a typical Oliver Stone movie, including its being about another Last Honest Man, whether or not it’s a typical Oliver Stone movie and whether or not I’m an Oliver Stone fan doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan and &quot;Snowden&quot; features what’s becoming a typically excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance.</p>
<p>An excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance doesn’t mean an excellent movie. It just means a movie that’s at least worth watching for Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s performance.</p>
<p>Gordon-Levitt’s Snowden is watchful, self-contained, maybe not emotionally repressed but definitely willfully undemonstrative. He rarely seems to smile on his own volition. A smile is a reflexive reaction he should have controlled. When he’s made to smile---and it’s always as if been made to, against his will and better judgement---there’s a look in his eye that’s partly regret and partly amused admiration for whatever or whoever’s forced him to smile, as if he’s been fooled by a card trick he should have known better than to fall for but he still can’t help enjoying the trick and having been tricked in spite of himself. And talks openly only a little more often than he smiles. He says only what he has to say. He has a vibrant inner life but he’s determined to keep it to himself. He’s an intellectual and a voracious reader. He thinks deeply and philosophically about what he reads. But you have to work hard to get him to talk about it. You have to work hard to get him to talk, period. When he does speak it’s with a slight, barely perceptible hesitation, and with a studying look in his eyes, as if he’s scouting the path a sentence is going to take for holes to avoid stepping in and roots to avoid tripping over. It’s as if he’s hooked himself up to an inner lie detector test to ensure that everything he’s about to say---and feel---is truthful and accurate. A conversation style that cuts down on small talk. That’s the point. Talking just for the sake of talking is when you’re likely to give yourself away.</p>
<p>Not that Snowden has anything to hide---when we first meet him, at any rate. He’s not deceitful. He’s not particularly shy, either, and not naturally taciturn. His reticence is more like a point of principle. His business is his business, and yours is yours. He’s the living embodiment of the principle he’s ultimately going to ruin his life defending. No one gets to pry into anyone else’s life without explicit, specific, and limited permission.</p>
<p>Conversations should be about practical matters at hand, and he’s not just willing but eager to talk about those. He’ll gladly go into detail about what he’s working on---if you have the security clearance and he’s judged you smart enough and competent enough to follow him. He just won’t tell you why he’s working on it and for whom he’s doing the work.</p>
<p>Temperamentally, intellectually, emotionally, and, as it turns out, politically and ideologically he’s suited for working for the NSA and the CIA, which is to say essentially as a spy and an eager volunteer in the cyberwar on terror. Edward Snowden, I was surprised to learn, was a Republican and a libertarian when he started out in the intelligence business.</p>
<p>The problem, he learns to his own dismay, is that the nature of the work he has to do, and wants to do, and is proud to do and be able to do, is in conflict with his own nature.</p>
<p>As it happens, at this critical point in his life he falls in love with someone who in her own way is as all wrong for him as it’s becoming clear his job is all wrong for him.</p>
<p>His job requires him to treat everyone else’s business--and it’s literally everyone else’s business---as his business. Being in love with the politically liberal artist and professional free-spirit Lindsay Mills, played charmingly, exuberantly, and winsomely---but not too winsomely ---by Shailene Woodley, means allowing his business to become her business and through her the business of everyone else or, at any rate, anyone else she whimsically decides to share it with it and, given her nature, that could mean literally everyone else.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Along Came Lindsay Joseph Gordon Leavitt and Shailene Woodley as Ed Snowden and Lindsay Mills - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be40913ab200d-640wi" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Along Came Lindsay Joseph Gordon Leavitt and Shailene Woodley as Ed Snowden and Lindsay Mills - Edited" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If Snowden’s motto is “Nothing about me is your business”, hers is “Everything about me is not only your business but something I expect you’ll find totally fascinating.”</p>
<p>Good liberal that she is, she isn’t the least bit worried about the government’s spying on her or on anybody because she not only doesn’t have anything incriminating to hide, she doesn’t hide anything. She puts her whole life online, practically uploading her soul and personality, a virtual her who’s even more open and free-spirited and uninhibited as the analog her.</p>
<p>She’s an exhibitionist. Her whole life is a work of performance art. Multi-talented, her art of the moment is photography and she’s using her camera to chronicle her life. Snowden, as an important part of her life, is an important part of the chronicle. He must be photographed. Continually. He’s her favorite model. She adores him as a person so she adores him as a subject. He has to perform for her. For her camera, at any rate. He has to smile. And despite himself, he does. He even begins to enjoy it, both smiling and performing for her.</p>
<p>So, even though at first glance in one way she’s all wrong for him, she’s in this way just right for him. She frees him up to be more himself. She brings him out of himself, gets him out and about in the world, shows him how to have fun and enjoy what life offers beyond work. It’s the old, old story going back to Pride and Prejudice. Creative and intelligent and passionate free-spirited young woman finds true love and happiness by saving a dour, emotionally repressed, all work and no play from himself and the stodgy, conventional boring life he’s headed for. It’s an old story but a good story.</p>
<p>Trouble is it’s usually a funny story.</p>
<p>&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a comedy. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, another version, is a farce. Buried in &quot;Snowden&quot; is a comedy that could be called &quot;Along Came Lindsay&quot;. Ed Snowden is a Mister Darcy who’s a genius computer programmer addicted to his work. Lindsay Mills is an Elizabeth Bennett who takes nude selfies and posts them on the internet. They get together, despite themselves, and live happily if somewhat complicatedly ever after.</p>
<p>This would be fine if only the story around them had also been a comedy. It could have been one too, if Stone had chosen to see it that way. There is something farcical about the government’s “Let’s spy on everybody!” plan to combat terror. And the character who serves as the movie’s central villain, a CIA operative named O’Brian and Snowden’s suave and sophisticated but sinister mentor, brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans, is in essence a comic villain.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-pi"><img alt="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026bde8a4d74200c-640wi" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Movies and TV Snowden Rhys Ifans as OBrian" /></a></p>
<p>With his long lupine face topped off by snow white hair combed boyishly forward, he looks like Draco Malfoy whom no one has told is now middle-aged and a lot less pretty than he was when he and Harry Potter last crossed wands---an effect probably emphasized in my mind by Gordon-Levitt’s looking as though the part of Snowden was between him and Daniel Radcliffe and Stone told him he’d only cast him if he played it as a grown-up and grown Severus Snape-grim Harry. O’Brian’s improbable hair cut hints at the man’s vanity as well as his phoniness.</p>
<p>Feeling professionally obligated to keep his true self hidden and to appear in the world in disguise, he’s chosen for his primary false identity to disguise himself as someone twenty years younger. In another of his guises, he’s a Hemingwayesque outdoorsman and hunter. (For this one he wears a Stetson that looks as improbable on him as the haircut.) He’s also, at various times, a <em>bon vivant</em> and man of the world and a country club-style hale fellow well met type of 19th hole regular as gregarious and sycophantic as if he’s congratulating business contacts he’s let beat him at golf. (This one seems to be real in that it’s something he really does as part of his spy craft.)</p>
<p>The role he plays most often with Snowden is that of wise to the ways of the world and magic wizard instructing an apprentice, Merlin to Snowden’s Arthur, Dumbledore to Harry, Obi-wan---the haircut is also reminiscent of Alec Guinness’s wig in the original Star Wars movies---to his Luke.</p>
<p>All of these disguises are self-flattering and self-aggrandizing and there’s comedy to be found in his inflated view of himself. But it’s also a wonder that he can keep them all straight and doesn’t occasionally play the wrong part at the wrong time for the wrong audience and that could have been funny, his getting mixed up from time to time. A few more good jokes and with Stone pushing him to ham it up a bit more---or giving him permission to. Ifans probably wouldn’t have needed much prodding or direction. He is British, after all, (Well, Welsh, technically, but so was Burton) and the Brits are taught how to be hams as part of their basic training as actors.---and O’Brian would have been a funny bad guy.</p>
<p>But even though there are funny moments in &quot;Snowden&quot;, Stone doesn’t find any of the larger story amusing. That’s one of the reasons I’m not a fan. There’s never much he finds amusing. That’s ok, though. Not all love stories are comedies. Young lovers who would have had happy endings if only the grown-ups had stayed out of it are regularly in story and song brought to sorrow and grief. (See &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.) For stretches of the movie, it looks as though that’s what’s going to happen to Snowden and Mills. His work is going to break them up, break their spirits, and break their hearts. There’s even a tragic flaw within their love for each other that would have helped that to happen.</p>
<p>As good as she is for him in one way, she’s bad for him in another, because, despite her being a liberal hippie in comparison to him, she’s a spoiled rich girl used to living well and traveling in the “right” social circles. His job allows for both and she likes that.</p>
<p>As O’Brian’s protege he’s invited into the homes of the Beltway elite where he meets and is taken a shine to by important and Very Serious People who are happy to boost his career. When he gives up government work only to go back to work for the government as a consultant, his salary jumps and he and Mills are suddenly very flush with money. At first, Snowden’s not impressed by either the money or the social advancement. But he is impressed by how it makes her happy. And, under her influence, he begins to like it too, both the money and the social success.</p>
<p>On top of this, Mills is a bit of a vicarious thrill-seeker and she pushes him to go out into the field and do some actual spying.</p>
<p>This leads to what I think is the best section of &quot;Snowden&quot;, almost a movie within the movie that could have been expanded into the plot of an entire Hitchcockinan thriller focused wholly Snowden and Mills as a pair of innocents caught up in intrigue and adventure.</p>
<p>Snowden is sent to Austria---setting of &quot;The Third Man&quot;---where he teams up with a charming but oily, hedonistic, and morally bankrupt operative, played by a leering and cheerfully dissolute Timothy Olyphant to manipulate an innocent banker into giving them information about a would-be terrorist. The banker isn’t connected to the terrorist himself. He has family connections who have connections to people who have connections to people who...you get the picture. He himself has no idea how he’s connected at such a remove, but Snowden and his partner get to those connections through his daughter. This leads to tragedy and Snowden’s first serious crisis of conscience.</p>
<p>There Stone had a story, if he’d wanted to tell it, about a pair of lovers who are tempted by money, status, and the pure thrill of behaving amorally and either fall into corruption or are saved from it by their own innate decency or the intervention of angels in human form, a tragedy or a comedy, whichever way he chose. He chose to go back to his main story about Snowden standing up to the System. That could have been a tragedy or a comedy too. Except for one hitch. Neither the tragedy nor the comedy happen because neither did happen.</p>
<p>You’d think that wouldn’t have been a problem for him since what really happened has never stopped him before from telling the story he wanted to tell and making the points he was determined to make.</p>
<p>But this time it did. Stone let himself be blocked by reality.</p>
<p>The real Snowden and Mills seem to be living out a romantic comedy. Who knows if they’ll live happily ever after, but from all appearances they’re living pretty happily in the here and now, despite the inconvenience of their Russian exile, a fate, by the way, the movie comes close to blaming on the Glenn Greenwald, the activist and blogger and columnist for the Guardian who advised Snowden at the time he decided to go public with what he knew about the mass surveillance and release the data he’d according to the law stolen from the U.S. Government. I’ll get to that in another post. The System gets taken down and Snowden and Mills survive as individuals and as a couple and Stone is left with a love story that’s neither comic nor tragic, just kind of sweet, interrupted too often by a not particularly dramatic historical drama.</p>
<p>Again, there’s a way he could have dealt with this. The one I suggested earlier. He could have the plot that surrounds the romance a comedy too or, at least, comedic.</p>
<p>For reasons I can only guess at, he didn’t do that. But then he didn’t do what I’d actually expected him to do. Treat the whole thing as a typical Oliver Stone overwrought melodrama.</p>
<p>There’s a surprising matter-of-factness to his storytelling in &quot;Snowden&quot;. A this happened, then this happened, then that happened straight-forwardness that not only cuts down on the suspense but causes the movie to resist emotional involvement.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to feel about all of this?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be a bit of a shrug.</p>
<p>Feel?</p>
<p>Ok. Then how about think? What are we supposed to think?</p>
<p>Another shrug.</p>
<p>I was dreading going to &quot;Snowden&quot; because I expected Stone would try to be as emotionally manipulative and intellectually dishonest---in the cause of dragging the audience to the right side---as he’s often been. I didn’t want to be imaginatively wrestled into taking Snowden’s side and cheering him on as a hero. But I think I would have enjoyed that better.</p>
<p>Stone seems to be way too willing to let the facts speak for themselves for once. In truth, he seems barely interested in presenting the facts at all. At any rate, he doesn’t do much to dramatize them, let alone over-dramatize them in keeping with what I’ve always thought is his idiom. He appears to take it for granted we know all we need to know about the government’s massive data gathering enterprises and that we disapprove on intellectual, constitutional, and moral grounds, and he doesn’t have to work to make us disapprove.</p>
<p>The result is some rather desultory storytelling with many confusing and lazy plot twists and turns. Details and events have to be left out, compressed, or elided in all historical movies for the sake of time and in order not to overwhelm the audience with facts as if in a well-meaning but counterproductive effort to help us cram for a final exam. But in &quot;Snowden&quot; those left-out details and events aren’t compensated for either imagistically or through poetic license. This happened, then that happened, then...this happened. Wait? What? How did we get to that last this happened? What happened during the ellipses?</p>
<p>We’ll have to go back and read the books.</p>
<p>As for Snowden and what good he did...or harm…</p>
<p>On this point, as with the other, Stone seems to take it for granted that since we already agree that what the government was doing was wrong on principle, then we already agree that what Snowden did to put a stop to it was right on principle, and therefore Snowden is a champion of truth, justice, and the American way, on principle, and we will cheer for him in the end, on principle.</p>
<p>I don’t like to go to movies on principle. I went to this one on the principle I needed to do my homework for the blog and I wasn’t looking forward to being manipulated. But I would rather be manipulated into cheering for the hero than being expected to do it on principle. And that’s what I missed most watching &quot;&quot;Snowden, Stone’s old manipulative tricks.</p>
<p>I missed his special pleadings. I missed his tampering with history and the histrionics that usually go with it. I missed his very dark view of America. The government as presented in &quot;Snowden&quot; is generally incompetent while being too competent at the wrong things, corrupt but only routinely so and mainly because individual actors are corrupt, and generally wrongheaded to the point of stupidity. Which is why I think it could have been treated comically. But it isn’t actively evil. And it isn’t anybody, really. President Obama appears in clips that show him saying things we now know were official lies. But that’s all they are, official lies of the sort any and all political leaders engage in as a matter of course. There’s no George W. Bush here, no Dick Cheney. I didn’t miss them, particularly. But I missed there being real villains.</p>
<p>Especially the chief villain of Stone’s dark vision.</p>
<p>I missed Nixon.</p>

<p><strong>Nerdy makers</strong><br />
As someone who makes things, I am very interested in new materials, cool ways to hack off-the-shelf products, and innovative techniques for constructing stuff. All these subjects are covered in an occasional free newsletter, <a href="https://wheelhouse.substack.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Wheelhouse</a>, written for nerdy makers. Wheelhouse also hosts a Discord community whose discussions generate content for the newsletter. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Superglue and baking soda for fixing broken plastic parts</strong><br />
My friend <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675949/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Bob</a> sent me this video about using <a href="https://youtu.be/2tHhW1XOm2U?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">super glue and baking soda to fix broken plastic parts</a>. When it cures it is rock hard. I used this material to repair a broken dimmer switch knob and it didn’t break when I intentionally tried to snap it between my hands. — MF</p>
<p><strong>How to comfort someone</strong><br />
I think being able to make someone feel better is a superpower and one that I often fail at when I go into problem-solving mode too soon. This article outlines “<a href="https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2020/07/29/The-Four-States-of-Distress-how-to-comfort-someone-when-something-bad-happens-to-them?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">The Four States of Distress</a>” — 1. Shocked. 2. Feeling bad and not wanting to feel better. 3. Ready to feel better. 4. Feeling better and needing solutions. — and suggests the most helpful actions you can take to comfort someone at each state. It also shines a light on “comfort languages,” and after some thought, I recognized my comfort language is having someone help me explore and understand my feelings (and distraction helps too!). — CD</p>
<p><strong>Super comfortable slippers I can wear outside</strong><br />
I rarely drive anywhere these days, and aside from taking walks a couple of times a day in the neighborhood, I’m sheltering in place. I decided to give my feet a break and I’m wearing slippers instead of shoes around the house. These $15 <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/rockdove-men-s-original-two-tone-memory-foam-slippers-dark-gray-blue-size-9-10?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">memory foam slippers from RockDove</a> have an open back that makes them easy to slip on and kick-off, and the memory foam insoles are incredibly comfortable. Importantly they have a thick waterproof sole, so I can wear them in the backyard. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Free music soundtracks for video</strong><br />
The secret sauce for successful film- and video-making is the audio. The easiest way to add a musical score and sound effects to home-made video, particularly if you will be uploading it to YouTube, is to use the large collection of license-free music and effects in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCht8qITGkBvXKsR1Byln-wA?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">YouTube Audio</a> library. It’s free. Many tracks are pretty good. And the music is guaranteed to be “clear” and not cause copyright or monetization issues on YouTube. I’ve been using them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLr3Q2Qayr1ANe72ystgWXp9j3qIYkRinJ&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;v=RPM6uXxPD-w" target="_blank">on my videos</a>. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Best contact solution</strong><br />
I’ve been a contact wearer for 20+ years and have always bought the cheapest, store brand cleaning solution on the shelf thinking they were all the same. I was forced to buy <a href="https://geni.us/usFoSH?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Opti-Free Puremoist with HydraGlyde</a> ($10, 10 fl oz) while I was on vacation and it was the only option, and I’m so happy I did, because they make my contacts feel like silk! The <a href="https://geni.us/pu5MXHG?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Puremoist Rewetting Drops</a> also help keep my contacts comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. — CD</p>

    <p>Donald Trump loves to fill vacant positions by simply appointing acting officials, thus bypassing the Senate confirmation process that he finds so annoying. Unfortunately for him, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/top-dhs-officials-wolf-cuccinelli-are-not-legally-eligible-serve-their-current-roles-congressional-watchdog-agency-finds/">that&#8217;s not always legal:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top two officials at the Department of Homeland Security are serving unlawfully in their roles, the Government Accountability Office said Friday, dealing a rebuke to President Trump’s affinity for filling senior executive roles in his administration with “acting” leaders who lack Senate confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good for the GAO, but how many divisions do they have? This is a president who&#8217;s deliberately wrecking the post office to gain a partisan advantage over Democrats. He sent domestic troops to Portland to create chaos that would help sell his law-and-order campaign theme. He&#8217;s pulled the birther card against Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and now Kamala Harris. He had protesters near the White House gassed so he could do a photo op. He pardons his pals even if they&#8217;ve committed crimes so obvious that even Bill Barr calls their prosecution righteous. He retweets lunatic QAnon conspiracies. He tried to get a foreign leader to open a criminal investigation of a political opponent. He has relentlessly tried to undermine the census. And he&#8217;s done all this stuff without a peep of protest from anyone in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So what are the odds that anyone will try to make him obey the law now? About zero, I think.</p>

    <p>Ari Sen and Brandy Zadrozny, reporting for NBC News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An internal investigation by Facebook has uncovered thousands of
groups and pages, with millions of members and followers, that
support the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to internal company
documents reviewed by NBC News. […]</p>

<p>Facebook and other platforms face a unique challenge in moderating
QAnon communities, said Joan Donovan, director of the Kennedy
School’s Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy at
Harvard. The platforms act both as the “base infrastructure” for
networking and spreading content and a target of the conspiracy
theory itself, which frames Facebook and other platforms as
“oppressive regimes that seek to destroy truth,” Donovan said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were rightwing kook conspiracy cults before Facebook, but Facebook uniquely enables them to grow. QAnon’s existence isn’t Facebook’s fault; QAnon’s prominence is entirely Facebook’s fault.</p>

<p>And they know it. From the same story, italic emphasis added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enforcing against QAnon on Facebook is not new: we consistently
take action against accounts, Groups, and Pages tied to QAnon that
break our rules. Just last week, we removed a large Group with
QAnon affiliations for violating our content policies, and removed
a network of accounts for violating our policies against
coordinated inauthentic behavior,” the spokesperson, <em>who asked
not to be named for fear of harassment from the QAnon community</em>,
wrote in an emailed statement. “We have teams assessing our
policies against QAnon and are currently exploring additional
actions we can take.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How fucked up is it that Facebook has any tolerance at all for a large subculture on their platform that their own spokespeople fear?</p>

<p>Just kick them all off, close every one of the groups and close the Facebook accounts of everyone prominent in the community.</p>

    <p>Margaret Sullivan, media columnist for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what about next week and next month?</p>

<p>Can something as dull-sounding as the workings of the Post Office
compete with former Trump attorney’s new tell-all book, whose
foreword includes lines like: “From golden showers in a sex club
in Vegas, to tax fraud, to deals with corrupt officials from the
former Soviet Union, to catch and kill conspiracies to silence
Trump’s clandestine lovers, I wasn’t just a witness to the
president’s rise — I was an active and eager participant.”</p>

<p>Can it break into the endless political takes on Kamala D. Harris
as Joe Biden’s running mate, or the next political horse-race
story that’s around the corner?</p>

<p>Fat chance.</p>

<p>But if journalists don’t keep the pressure on Postal Service
problems, they will be abdicating their duty. There’s very little
that matters more than the Nov. 3 vote. Anything that threatens
the integrity of the vote needs to be treated as one of the
biggest stories out there — even if it’s not the sexiest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just anecdotally, our mail situation here in Philadelphia has been <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mail-voting-phiadelphia-post-office-delays-20200806.html">just jaw-droppingly atrocious</a> the last 6 weeks or so.

    <p>The COVID-19 charts were up late today, but there was a good reason: I stayed up all night hoping to do some Milky Way photography, and then slept in until 11 after I got home. So how did I do?</p>
<p>Badly. The whole trip was a complete bust. I tried a new spot on Palomar Mountain and there was just too much light there. Also, the sky was cloudy despite my astro-app telling me the sky would be clear. And even if it had been clear, it just wasn&#8217;t a good night for viewing. I could barely even see the Milky Way, let alone photograph it.</p>
<p>So instead I switched gears and took pictures of the clouds. My original goal had been to take multiple shots of the Milky Way and stitch them together, thus getting a single image that showed it from end to end. Instead, I did this for the sky as I found it. This one is eight frames stitched together:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859362"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1300px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859362" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="246" srcset="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg 2000w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=321,61 321w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=630,119 630w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=1536,291 1536w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=50,9 50w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=1300,246 1300w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=990,188 990w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_wide_sky.jpg?resize=642,122 642w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="media-credit">August 15, 2020 — Near Palomar Mountain, California</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This picture has a certain charm, but it&#8217;s very long and thin, which wasn&#8217;t my intention. I did take a series of pictures with the camera pointed higher, but I somehow screwed up the middle batch and this was enough to cause Photoshop to choke when it tried to merge them. So the bottom series of photos is all I have.</p>
<p>A few miles away I took this picture of a cityscape. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t really know just what city this is. Judging from the position of Venus, my best guess is Warner Springs:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859361"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1300px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859361" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="558" srcset="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg 2000w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=321,138 321w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=630,271 630w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=1536,660 1536w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=50,21 50w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=1300,558 1300w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=990,425 990w, https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_night_palomar_cityscape.jpg?resize=642,276 642w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="media-credit">August 15, 2020 — Near Palomar Mountain, California</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is three photos stitched together. I took a second series with a different exposure to get a better rendition of the cityscape, but for some reason Photoshop wouldn&#8217;t merge them. They were nearly identical to the first set, so I don&#8217;t know what happened.</p>
<p>One of these days I need to get a better idea of what the Photomerge function needs to work properly. It almost randomly seems to work on some sets of images and choke on others. When it fails, I always check the images to see if there&#8217;s plenty of overlap, and there always is. So what&#8217;s up?</p>

<p>Last year I wrote a post about being a <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/10/09/computational-survivalist/">computational survivalist</a>, someone able to get their work done with just basic command line tools when necessary. This post will be a different take on the same theme.</p>
<p>I just got a laptop from an extremely security-conscious client. I assume it runs Windows 10 and that I will not be able to install any software without an act of Congress. I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t booted it up. And in fact I <em>cannot</em> boot it up yet because I don&#8217;t have the badge yet to unlock it.</p>
<p>If being able to work with just default command line tools is like wilderness survival, being able to work with only consumer software is like urban survival, like trying to live in an abandoned shopping mall.</p>
<p>There must be some scientific software on the laptop. I imagine I may have to re-implement from scratch some tools that aren&#8217;t installed. I&#8217;ve been in that situation before.</p>
<p>One time I was an expert witness on a legal case and had to review the other side&#8217;s software. I could only work on their laptop, from their attorney&#8217;s office, with no network connection and no phone. I could request some software to be installed before I arrived, so I asked them to put Python on the laptop. I could bring books into the room with the laptop, so I brought the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hdnqyx">Python Cookbook</a> with me.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, or <code>awk</code>, but you do have Perl, you and roll your own version of the utilities in a few lines of code. For example, see <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/06/12/perl-as-a-better-grep/">Perl as a better grep</a>.</p>
<p>I always use LaTeX for writing math, but the equation editor in Microsoft Word supports a large amount of LaTeX syntax. Or at least it did when I last tried it <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/07/15/microsoft-word-equation-editor/">a decade ago</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows command line has more Unix-like utilities than you might imagine. Several times I&#8217;ve typed a Unix command at the Windows <code>cmd.exe</code> prompt, thought &#8220;Oh wait. I&#8217;m on Windows, so that won&#8217;t work,&#8221; and the command works. The biggest difference between the Windows and Linux command lines is not the utilities per se. You can install many of the utilities, say through <a href="https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki">GOW</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference in command lines is that on Windows, each utility parses its own arguments, whereas on Linux the shell parses the arguments first and passes the result to the utilities. So, for example, passing multiple files to a utility may or may not work on Windows, depending on the capability of the utility. On Linux, this just works because it is the shell itself rather than the utilities launched from the shell that orchestrates the workflow.</p>
<p>I expect this new project will be very interesting, and worth putting up with the minor annoyances of not having my preferred tools at my fingertips. And maybe it won&#8217;t be as hard as I imagine to request new software. If not, it can be fun to explore workarounds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a guilty pleasure to find a way to get by without the right tool for the job. It would be a waste of time under normal circumstances, and not something the client should be billed for, but you can hack with a clear conscience when you&#8217;re forced into doing so.</p>

<h5><strong><em><span style="color: #5b5b5b;">Carpe die</span>m!:</em></strong> Scene from &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; starring Robin Williams.</h5>
<p><em>Another very short essay from the <a href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/mining_the_notebooks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of In Search of Lost Time</a> as I try to catch up on my blogging: This one’s from April 1, 2020:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People see what they expect to see. They see what they want to see. That doesn’t mean that what they do see is an illusion or a delusion. It means there are gaps. They haven&#39;t picked up all the pieces. Our minds put together the scene our eyes are taking in like a puzzle that doesn’t need all the pieces to look complete. That’s usually enough to get us safely through the moment. But not often enough to assess what else is going on and come to conclusions about what any of it means. We have to take that into account, and look around us from many angles. We have to climb up on the desk with Robin Williams in “Dead Poets Society.” Even we liberals in the reality-based community have trouble remembering to do this and have to keep reminding ourselves. But conservatives don’t do this. One quick look around them from where they complacently sit is enough. Self-satisfaction in their single viewpoint is a hallmark of conservatives. It’s what makes them conservative. It’s why they stay conservative.</p>

    <p>Kyle Orland, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most if not all of the complaints Epic makes against Apple and
Google seem to apply to Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo in the
console space as well. All three console makers also take a
30-percent cut of all microtransaction sales on their platforms,
for example. […]</p>

<p>On mobile platforms, Epic is calling the same kind of 30-percent
fee “exorbitant” and says it wants to offer a more direct payment
solution so it can “pass along the savings to players.” On
consoles, though, Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">happily introduced a permanent 20-percent
discount</a> on all microtransaction purchases, despite there
being no sign that the console makers have changed their fee
structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. This is exactly the point I’ve been trying to make since the Xbox Game Pass controversy last week. Microsoft wants Apple to allow on iOS something they themselves will not allow on Xbox.</p>

<p>If you think Epic is right in principle about iOS and Android, then they ought to be making the same argument about Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. A computer is a computer. “Consoles” are a business model and user experience design choice, and the iPhone and iPad are effectively <em>app</em> consoles, where games are just one type of app. It’s a shame (in more ways than this) that Apple TV isn’t a bigger player, because it’s just another variant of iOS.</p>

<p>But instead of fighting the game consoles, Epic is taking <em>more</em> of a hit: Fortnite players on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch get the 20 percent reduction in price <em>while Epic still pays</em> the 30 percent cut of each transaction to the platform vendor. It’s a stunt, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Orland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe Epic just has a better relationship with console makers
than mobile phone makers. […]  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/9/21318965/sony-epic-games-investment-fortnite-unreal-engine">Sony recently invested $250
million in Epic</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/behind-the-scenes-of-that-incredible-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo/">prominently featured Epic’s Unreal Engine
5</a> in a recent major PlayStation 5 promotional demo, too. Even
Nintendo, which traditionally uses its own technology for game
development, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/7/14533324/nintendo-switch-unreal-engine-miyamoto">has begun using Unreal Engine for its own titles in
recent years</a>. In a way, Epic can’t attack these platform
holders without also attacking itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure that has nothing to do with it.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>

    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">A few big scoops from Mark Gurman yesterday</a> that got lost in the shuffle a bit after Epic went to war against the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino,
California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early
as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said. […]</p>

<p>There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package
will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive
variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming
service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier
bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Apple One” passes the sniff test as a credible name for the bundle. But this description, if accurate, seems contrary to the spirit of the name. It’s not just <em>one</em> bundle, which to me is what Apple ought to offer. What Gurman describes is a frustrating jumble of à la carte offerings that seems no different than the current situation, where every Apple subscription offering is a standalone service, other than some sort of discount for subscribing to more than one service, but only if you subscribe to them in certain predefined tiers.</p>

<p>What Gurman is describing would offer nothing, for example, if you want Apple Music/TV+ and additional iCloud storage but have no interest in Arcade or News+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company is also developing a new subscription for virtual
fitness classes that can be used via an app for the iPhone, iPad
and Apple TV, the people said. That service will be offered in a
higher-end bundle with the rest of Apple’s services. Codenamed
“Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered
by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.,
according to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This service simultaneously seems like a very keen offering from a company that is focused more and more on health and fitness features across its platforms (especially Watch) <em>and</em> more fuel to the fire that Apple unfairly competes against popular services from third parties.</p>

<p><strike>Total scoop for Gurman here if this pans out — this is the first anyone has reported this, I believe.</strike> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/09/apple-ios-14-fitness-app-guided-workouts/">MacRumors had a report on this back in March</a>, including the codename “Seymour”, but if it’s a paid subscription and not a free app, that’s still a scoop for Gurman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will
work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as
many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to
save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the
package chosen. For example, if a family subscribes today to all
of Apple’s major services plus the highest iCloud storage tier,
that would cost about $45 a month. A new bundle could knock more
than $5 off that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not much of a discount. To me the whole point of a bundle should be twofold: a greatly simplified offering (“<em>Just buy Apple One and get it all</em>”) at a <em>very</em> compelling price (“<em>Even if you don’t think you care about, say, Arcade and News+, hey, you’re effectively getting them for free</em>”.)</p>

<p>That’s the secret sauce to Amazon Prime. It’s a simple decision — get Prime or don’t — at a compelling price that makes everything other than the free shipping on Amazon purchases feel “free”.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1293892274875768832">Peter Kafka, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long-awaited/predicted Apple bundles, coming this fall. The
problem: Bundles work when they include the thing people
love/want/need — sports for cable tv, free delivery for Amazon.
These bundles — per Bloomberg, are made up of Apple’s side gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great bundle offering does have a lynchpin. And while Prime and cable TV are good examples of that, they’re at extremes pricing-wise. Prime makes it feel like a good deal for shipping and everything else is free; cable TV makes it feel like you’re paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels you never watch just to get the ones you do (sports or otherwise).</p>

<p>So let’s think this through and figure out what Apple One “should” include and cost.</p>

<p>The big difference with Apple’s services is that everything is a standalone service, with reasonable à la carte pricing. Arcade and TV+ are just $5/month, including automatic family sharing. News+ is $10/month, including sharing. Music is $10 individually, and $15/month for a family sharing account. Music and News+ cost more (and Music, alone among Apple’s content offerings, charges extra for family sharing) because Apple doesn’t own the content.</p>

<p>Then there’s iCloud, the paid storage tiers for which haven’t changed in years. Right now in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 GB: $1/mo</li>
<li>200 GB: $3/mo</li>
<li>2 TB: $10/mo</li>
</ul>

<p>My back-of-the-envelope proposal is that Apple One should cost $15/month for an individual and $20/month for family sharing, and include: Music, TV+, Arcade, and the top tier of iCloud storage. Make News+ a $5/add-on.</p>

<p>Basically: start with Apple Music as the lynchpin service in the bundle, charge $5 more than they currently are for Music alone, and include everything Apple owns the entirety of: TV+, Arcade, and iCloud storage. I think they have to charge extra for News+ to pay the participating providers — News+ is more like a bundle unto itself. And that still leaves <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209670">TV Channels</a> as extra monthly add-ons, too. What Gurman describes sounds basically like “<em>Pay for a bunch of services on top of Apple Music, get one of them free</em>”; what I’m suggesting is more “<em>Pay for one additional service on top of Apple Music, get the rest free</em>”.</p>

<p>That would make for a simple proposition at a compelling price.</p>

    <p>Gabriel Sherman, reporting for Vanity Fair:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump didn’t expect Joe Biden to pick Kamala Harris as his
running mate. “He thought Biden would choose Karen Bass,” a
Republican briefed on Trump’s thinking said. Trump’s view,
according to sources close to the White House, was that Biden
would prefer a candidate with Bass’s low national profile and one
who wouldn’t outshine him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-surprised-biden-picked-kamala-221239304.html">Trump himself publicly admitted to being surprised</a> Biden chose Harris, on the grounds that she challenged Biden vigorously when she was competing against him for the nomination. Some leaders surround themselves with yes-men who will only tell them what they want to hear. Others surround themselves with independent thinkers who will offer their unvarnished opinion and advice. Trump should be pictured in the dictionary next to the entry for <em>projection</em>, so of course he expected Biden to choose how he himself chose.</p>

<p>Rightfully so, many are pointing to Biden’s choice, and Trump’s professed surprise at that choice, as clear indications of the profound temperamental differences between them.</p>

<p>I would just like to point out what this must be like to observe if you’re Mike Pence, knowing that Trump chose you because he thinks you’re a low-watt bulb with as much flavor as a chewed up piece of gum.</p>

Upon further investigation, we discovered that a developer&rsquo;s Xcode project at large contained the source malware, which leads to a rabbit hole of malicious payloads. Most notable in our investigation is the discovery of two zero-day exploits: one is used to steal cookies via a flaw in the behavior of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/security/sece3bee0835/web">Data Vaults</a>, another is used to abuse the development version of Safari.</p><p>This scenario is quite unusual; in this case, malicious code is injected into local Xcode projects so that when the project is built, the malicious code is run. This poses a risk for Xcode developers in particular. The threat escalates since we have identified affected developers who shared their projects on GitHub, leading to a supply-chain-like attack for users who rely on these repositories as dependencies in their own projects. We have also identified this threat in sources such as VirusTotal, which indicates this threat is at large.</p><p>This blog will summarize the findings of this threat, while its <a href="https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/XCSSET_Technical_Brief.pdf">accompanying technical brief</a> contains the full details of this attack.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://tidbits.com/2020/08/13/developers-v-apple-outlining-complaints-about-the-app-store/">
<p>At this critical juncture for the company, we wanted to take the opportunity to analyze the complaints against Apple regarding how it runs the App Store. We&rsquo;ve spent a long time observing and considering these issues, and you may agree or disagree with our evaluation and conclusions. As we are neither regulators nor Apple executives, the decisions are ultimately not up to us. We merely want to lay out the issues and offer suggestions on how Apple can improve, for the sake of users, developers, and even the long-term viability of the company itself.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The most likely path forward is for Apple to do nothing different until forced to change by a regulatory body. I say this is the most likely, because, from Apple&rsquo;s statements, the company seems to think it has nothing to apologize for and feels that it is doing the world a favor in the way it&rsquo;s running the App Store.</p>
<p>However, I think this would be a mistake that both the company and its fans would eventually regret.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of App Store news over the last few months, and this article ties it all together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In late June, Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump “wants to
cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in
ballots.” At the time, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/biden-floats-baseless-election-conspiracy/">we wrote</a> that the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee had no evidence of Trump’s ulterior motive — but now he does.</p>

<p>In an Aug. 13 interview, Trump admitted that he opposes a
coronavirus pandemic relief bill crafted by the House Democrats
because it includes funding the U.S. Postal Service and state
election officials — funding that Trump said is needed to allow
the Postal Service to handle an expected surge in mail-in voting.</p>

<p>In 1876, seventeen year old Arthur Conan Doyle began his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh or, to put it another way, he began to picture the world in which Sherlock Holmes would begin his career. In Doyle&#39;s imagination, Holmes&#39; London must have looked a lot like the Edinburgh he knew as a student...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dawn mists rose from the valley until they dwindled to a plume above Edinburgh Castle. Perched on a craggy basalt cliff, the castle rose several stories from the summit,which towered four hundred feet above the base. On the inland side rose a turret from whose crown of lancet windows archers had rain arrows upon besieging armies since the twelfth century.</p>
<p>The castle was so high that its time gun could be heard far in every direction. This civil reminder had been fired at one p.m. every day but one since early 1861, before [Doyle turned two], alerting Leith ship captains and New Town shop owners to set their clocks, while every man on Princes Street reached for a waistcoat pocket to check his watch. The sound carried so far from the castle that its instigator...Scotland’s Astronomer Royal...prepared a concentric map showing the number of seconds it took the gun’s boom to reach each distance, for even more accurate time keeping.</p>
<p>...The castle stood so high that shepherds in Fife could turn from shearing to glimpse it like a mirage on the horizon. Mariners sailing in from the northeast could peer up at its battlements long before they reached the shore. It provided an unparalleled view of the region---northward to the jagged peaks of the Grampians, eastward across a thousand diary rooftops toward the storied height of Arthur’s Seat, southward to the Pentlands…</p>

<p>The castle cast its royal shadow across a bustling market down in the city. The drum and bugle accompanying the changing of the guard could be heard above the clatter of carriage wheels, the rumble of passing trains. Dense with public houses and shops, bristling with turnpike stairs and crow stepped gables, the Grassmarket had been a public site since the fifteenth century. In [Doyle’s] time it was still renowned for its cattle and horse trading. The venerable White Hart Inn was there, and the Black Bull, with its marble relief columns framing the entrance, and above them the words SPIRIT J. WILKINSON MERCHANT. Next door stood the Carriers Warehouse, where one horse wagons clustered out front, piled with goods covered in tightly stretched tarpaulins against the frequent rain. To proclaim that their wares had traveled from exotic climes, the Tobacco &amp; Snuff Manufactury featured above its sign a bust of a turbaned man, perhaps formerly a figurehead on a ship’s prow. Beneath it, wagons uncoupled from their horses projected handy rails on which loungers could lean to smoke and gossip…</p>
<p>Clustered below and east of the castle, the dark streets of Old Town sprawled in medieval disarray---poorly bracketed upper stories bulging above greasy streets so narrow that a man walking could stretch out his arms and touch a grimy wall on either side. Once Edinbugh’s tall buildings had housed aristocracy, until crowding and plague had driven them to the suburbs. By the 1870s, however, soot-flecked washing fluttered on clothes poles jutting from the windows of once proud houses that bore above their door a scutcheon with a tarnished coat of arms. The view from many windows was a dreary prospect of slate roofs topped with red chimneys, spoutin eye-smarting clouds of smoke---with now and then the rooftop scrabble of a blackened urchin sweeping a chimney. Not surprisingly, the city had held on to its Middle Scots nickname, “Auld Reekie” (Old Smokey). Not only the smoke stank. So did the foul breath of the tanners and glue factories, and the effluvia from chamber pots emptied into street carts or into the streets themselve. At least the winds that buffeted the high elevation helped to dispel the stench…</p>

<p>[By the time Doyle started his studies at the university], many hovels and tenements [had been] torn down and replaced with safer and cleaner modern housing. Poverty and crowding still defined the Old Town [but]...</p>
<p>He could stand high on the wind-plagued North Bridge, which joined Old Town to the cleaner streets neo-classical buildings of New Town, and see the monuments to civil progress and mercantile ambition that had helped turn Edinburgh into a world-renowned center of intellectual labor. He was studying medicine in part because the university boasted one of the finest medical departments in the world. In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment had flowered in this center of research and publishing---philosopher and mathematician Dugald Stewart, economist Adam Smith, geologist James Hutton, and many others. Walter Scott, [Doyle’s] favorite novelist in his later youth, had been born in College Wynd, by Cowgate, not far from [Doyle’s] own birthplace; had lived in George Square by the university that [Doyle] attended every day, and had died only a generation before [Doyle’s] birth. Ambition and artistry were in the very air of Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="">For some time now I’ve been trying to increasingly work with my technology in terms of contexts, not apps. I don’t want to open the Mail App to check email. Instead, I want to open the mail app to look at my legal inbox and nothing else. I don’t want to open Safari to a home page. Instead, I want to open Safari to the specific page on my learn.macsparky platform that lets me manage customer support issues. Staying in context means avoiding getting sidetracked. It means checking the email in one account and not crashing into my email from&nbsp;<em>every account</em>. It means fixing a customer support problem without getting trapped by surfing dogs. (Yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://preview.convertkit-mail.com/click/3ohphkhdwn0r6z/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj10RE9NLVU3dVN0TQ==" target="_blank">There are surfing dogs</a>, and I love them.)<br><br>This idea started for me on the iPhone and quickly found its way to the iPad, using Shortcuts. Over the last few months, I've implemented this context-based computing on my Mac and it’s glorious. I'm pulling it all off with Keyboard Maestro. There are three areas in my life: Personal, MacSparky, and the legal practice. With just a few keyboard shortcuts I can perform all of my most common tasks in each area of my life&nbsp;<em>in context&nbsp;</em>using Keyboard Maestro.<br><br>Best of all,&nbsp;<strong>I'm going to share how I'm pulling this off in a free webinar on August 27</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://event.webinarjam.com/register/1/pwzg8hx">You can sign up now</a>.&nbsp;It will be a fun event full of Keyboard Maestro scripts and tips. It will be the first Field Guide webinar and I'm putting a lot of effort into it. I hope to see you on August 27.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you'd like to see the webinar but can't make it on August 27, go ahead and sign up. I'll be sending out a link to watch a recording of the webinar afterward.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/08/president-trump-has-a-great-idea-about-social-security-really/">A couple of days ago</a> I wrote that Donald Trump accidentally had a good idea when he proposed doing away with the payroll tax that funds Social Security. This prompted several readers to push back on the grounds that funding Social Security through ordinary income taxes would make it a budgetary football every year. But that&#8217;s not how it works.</p>
<p>Social Security is an entitlement. Technically, it&#8217;s classified as mandatory spending, which means that it gets paid out automatically and doesn&#8217;t require an annual appropriation. If you qualify, you get Social Security. Period. It doesn&#8217;t matter where the funding comes from.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that for the next couple of decades Social Security will be partially funded by income taxes anyway. The infamous trust fund, after all, is nothing but a bunch of government bonds in a filing cabinet somewhere in Virginia. If payroll taxes are insufficient to cover Social Security payments, the bonds are cashed in. And where does the money to redeem the bonds come from? The general fund, of course, which consists primarily of money from income taxes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how this all plays out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security payments are mandatory regardless of how they&#8217;re funded. Congress does not approve a Social Security budget every year.</li>
<li>Payroll taxes are regressive. Nobody on the left should defend them.</li>
<li>Income taxes are progressive. We like progressive taxes!</li>
<li>Funding Social Security through the general fund means (a) it&#8217;s funded by a progressive tax, and (b) there&#8217;s no more trust fund and no more blather about Social Security &#8220;going bankrupt&#8221; or similar nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back when Social Security was first started, FDR defended the payroll tax as &#8220;straight politics.&#8221; It was a way of tricking people into thinking that the money coming out of their paycheck was being &#8220;saved&#8221; in some way and then paid back to them when they retired. This has never been true, and FDR knew it, but it was a useful way of guaranteeing that Social Security couldn&#8217;t be touched in the future.</p>
<p>That may have been necessary 90 years ago, but it&#8217;s not anymore. It&#8217;s not the funding source that stops Congress from cutting Social Security payments, it&#8217;s the broad support for the program itself. It&#8217;s just too damn popular to screw around with.</p>
<p>Bottom line: There are several upsides to funding Social Security through the general fund and literally no downsides. This is something that any progressive should support.</p>

    <p>Jonathan Hoefler, on designing the new Biden-Harris logo without knowing that Kamala Harris would be Joe Biden’s pick for running mate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t remember an election in which so much attention (and
speculation) has surrounded the choice of a running mate, nor
having such a large field of eminently qualified candidates to
choose from. A consequential decision at an unpredictable time,
conducted under absolute secrecy, poses an interesting dilemma to
the typographer: how do you create a logo without knowing for
certain what the words will say? Logos, after all, are
meaningfully informed by the shapes of their letters, and a logo
designed for an <span class="caps">EISENHOWER</span> will hardly
work for a <span class="caps">TAFT</span>. The solution,
naturally, involves the absurd application of brute force: you
just design all the logos you can think of, based on whatever
public information you can gather. Every credible suggestion
spotted in an op-ed was added to the list that we designers
maintained, and not once did the campaign even hint at a
preference for one name over another.</p>

    <p>Here&#8217;s something you might not have seen before: average earnings of blue collar workers over the past few months. Thanks to the rescue bills—primarily the CARES Act—average pay for blue collar workers has gone up 4 percent since February:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859194"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859194" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_blue_collar_weekly_july_2020.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="634"></figure>
<p>And what are people doing with this extra money? Putting it in the bank and then drawing it down:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859197"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859197" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_personal_savings_july_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="624"></figure>
<p>Workers drew down $3 trillion in savings in May and June. At this rate, the extra savings generated by the CARES Act will be gone by the end of August. September is going to be a very grim month for a lot of people if Congress doesn&#8217;t get itself back in session quickly and pass another rescue bill. Because it&#8217;s a dead certainty that COVID-19 won&#8217;t be gone by then.</p>

<a href="https://www.muji.us/store/4548076252818.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Point Pressing Ball</a> ($8)<br />
This is a little thing that I picked up on a trip to Tokyo. A friend of mine hauled me into a Muji. They&#8217;re all over the world, but they&#8217;re not everywhere. It&#8217;s a porcelain ball that looks like if you put a golf ball through some sort of dimensional torque and got it to expand and contract. And so, it has little knobs all over it. Then what I like to do is just rub it around my hands and rub my feet over it, especially if I&#8217;ve been walking a lot, and especially if I&#8217;m out and I don&#8217;t have my regular massage tools. I&#8217;ve used a whole bunch of other types of hand and foot massage things. What I like about this is that it&#8217;s very social in that I can use it and nobody can hear it. So it doesn&#8217;t make any noise and I&#8217;m not likely to drop it too much, whereas some of the other massage balls for hands and feet, I feel like I&#8217;m either dropping them or they&#8217;re clacking around, or they&#8217;re making some sort of noise. This is super portable. I can throw it in my Dopp kit and then I&#8217;m off.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36825" src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/henrymask.jpg" alt="henrymask" width="500" height="489" /><br />
<a href="https://henrymask.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Mask</a> (Monthly subscription: $40, 4pk)<br />
I like this because it feels like origami for your face. It&#8217;s not paper, it&#8217;s not cloth. It&#8217;s a mask. There’s three folds. It has a part that sticks out. A friend of mine said kind of beak like, but it has a part that you can pull up over your nose and pull down under your chin. You can either use it over the ears or you can use it behind your head. I feel like it fits a lot of people&#8217;s faces. I&#8217;ve so far never seen anybody not look good in this. But what I really like about it is that it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s got great design on it. It&#8217;s got bright colors, and even the muted ones still look like they&#8217;re interesting to wear, and fun, and well-designed, and I feel that the part that sticks out allows me to breathe better. You don&#8217;t get that blow back when you&#8217;re talking or breathing. Another thing that I really like about it is, one, masks get worn out and stinky, and I think you get bored with them and you need something to look forward to. This is something coming in the mail that is bright and colorful and makes you excited to wear it. If you&#8217;re going to be excited to wear any mask, this would be the one that I&#8217;d be excited to wear.</p>

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/star-battle-go-logic-puzzles/id1494377962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Battle Go Logic Puzzles</a><br />
My gaming is usually around word games. Star Battle Go is not a word game. I think most people describe it as having a more Sudoku feel to it. When I read the notes on it, it said it was created in 2003 by a Dutch creator. A friend of mine saw this game somewhere and she decided to make her own. So she created the game, and the way she designed is so elegant. It just works very well. Imagine if you have a 10 by 10 square, and you have different shapes within it. And within those shapes, you can have only two stars, and you have to place the stars. You can only have two stars per column and two stars per row. You have to figure out, in this row, in this column, and in this shape, how to place your stars. And then, of course, it will fill in the places that you can&#8217;t place your stars, or you can make it harder on yourself and not give yourself those clues. There are other versions of this game but this one is simple and well-designed and the puzzles are great. It is my current fav phone strategy game and mind refresher and my only non word-based game.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36827" src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/songsleuth.jpg" alt="songsleuth" width="231" height="500" /><br />
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/song-sleuth-auto-bird-song-id/id968399159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Song Sleuth: Auto Bird Song ID</a><br />
I&#8217;ll give you the background: In these last three months, there&#8217;s not been a lot of noise. And I think there&#8217;s been more birds. Birds have been chattering away, or I&#8217;ve noticed them more. So it&#8217;s pretty exciting to walk outside and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is that? It&#8217;s like the cycling noise or a rat-a-tat-tat, or what&#8217;s going on? A friend of mine turned me on to Song Sleuth, which is if you want to call it Shazam for birds. You have to record it and then you pull down the recording. There&#8217;s a way for you to manipulate the sound recording so that you&#8217;re just isolating, as much as possible, the bird sound. Then it says ID and it runs it against what it knows and gives you some possible matches. Then allows you to hear what those birds are so that you then can determine if the match is correct. This is not a tool for expert birders. There&#8217;s all sorts of complaining going on out there. But for me, I&#8217;m not an expert birder. I don&#8217;t know anything. I&#8217;m just looking at something and going, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; And it surprises me. A lot of times, what I&#8217;ve gotten are like House Finch. So it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m getting back things that are so revelatory. Every once in a while, it&#8217;ll give me something super uncommon, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re just toying with me. I did not hear some super rare bird.” So I think that there&#8217;s room to grow with this app, but it&#8217;s just fun to play with, and hear, and observe, when I think that more wildlife is out there taking up space that humans used to be taking up.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://twitter.com/safecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Safecast</strong></a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> is a way for people and communities to self-publish environmental data. What that amounts to is, how do I know if my air is clean or how do I know what the radiation is around me? The reason why we publish air quality and radiation are that Safecast originally was born out of the Daiichi Fukushima nuclear meltdown. It started almost nine years ago with that event, and people at the time did not know what their radiation exposure was. They got to gather and figured out a way to build small handheld mobile radiation measurement devices and then they went and mapped their environment to find out what their exposure had been. That ended up being a wonderful worldwide project. And so, the newest monitor that we&#8217;re working with is the Airnote, which was put together by Safecast volunteers. It has this great ability to be placed anywhere because it doesn&#8217;t require WiFi, and it doesn&#8217;t require an electricity source. It has a solar cell. It automatically uploads data so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. You can just place it wherever works best for you. One of the things that is really important to me about that is that it makes it really accessible to more people. It will allow people who can&#8217;t afford WiFi, or don&#8217;t have maybe a space next to their home, they&#8217;ll be able to place it somewhere and do some documentation as well.</p>

<p class="">Allison Sheridan and Bart Busschots did a series on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/subscribe-to-the-podcasts/" target="_blank"><span>Allison’s podcast</span></a>&nbsp;about using the Mac Terminal.

Now they have&nbsp;<a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/taming-the-terminal/id1525625941" target="_blank"><span>released the series as a free eBook on the Apple Book Store</span></a>, or if you’re interested in other formats like PDF, HTML, or Kindle, you can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://podfeet.com/tttbook" target="_blank"><span>podfeet.com/tttbook</span></a>.

    <p>Let <em>n</em> be a positive integer and <em>x</em> any real number. If you multiply <em>x</em> by <em>n</em>, then divide by <em>n</em>, of course you get <em>x</em> back.</p>
<p>Now suppose you multiply <em>x</em> by <em>n</em>, round down, then divide by <em>n</em>, and round down again. Do you get <em>x</em> back?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. The last step rounds down to an integer, so you couldn&#8217;t possibly get <em>x</em> back unless <em>x</em> was an integer to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you do get back <em>x</em> rounded down to the nearest integer. In symbols,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/mult_div_floor.svg" alt="\left\lfloor \frac{\lfloor nx \rfloor}{n} \right\rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor" width="111" height="43" /></p>
<p>Here ⌊<em>y</em>⌋ is the floor of <em>y</em>, the greatest integer less than or equal to <em>y</em>. I found this via Problem 5 <a href="https://orion.math.iastate.edu/ehjohnst/PoW/Sp2020/Sp2020.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The equation says that, in a limited sense, multiplication and division commute with taking floors. But you do have to assume <em>n</em> is an integer, and it&#8217;s important that you multiply first, then divide. The corresponding equation where you divide first doesn&#8217;t always hold.</p>
<p>The relationship above may not seem so surprising if you haven&#8217;t worked with floors, but generally floors and ceilings don&#8217;t play so nicely with other operations. The most tedious chapter of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RU4rgV">Concrete Mathematics</a> is probably the one devoted to manipulating expressions with floors and ceilings. Once you expect these manipulations to be difficult, which they usually are, you find it remarkable that something would work out so simply.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of an immediate application for this identity, though I vaguely recall wanting to use something like this and concluding that it probably wasn&#8217;t true.</p>

    <p>You’ll forgive the pun, but <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">Epic Games revealed an epic update to Fortnite for iOS today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and
Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct
payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment
processing savings to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What costs $10 through an App Store payment costs only $8 direct from Epic. (That’s not really passing the entirety of the savings to the user — Epic nets $7 from a $10 App Store in-app purchase, but minus credit card fees nets about $7.75 from an $8 direct payment. But, from a user’s perspective, it’s a 20 percent discount.)</p>

<p>Epic shipped this feature via an update that was delivered entirely through the Fortnite app itself, not through a new version of the app submitted through the App Store. And yes, this entire gambit is every bit as against the rules of the App Store as you think it is. Epic did this without any permission from Apple and without giving Apple any notice.</p>

<p>The only question was what Apple would do. If Apple decided to play on Easy mode, their move might have been to keep Fortnite in the App Store but stop accepting updates to the app. (But again, Fortnite shipped this particular feature without submitting a new version of the app itself.) Playing on Medium difficulty, which is what Apple chose, meant removing Fortnite — an immensely popular game — from the App Store.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-13"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-13">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here’s Apple’s statement, in its entirety, which they sent to multiple publications (including Daring Fireball) hours after Epic’s opening gambit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App
Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and
designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their
Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a
feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple,
and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store
guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer
who sells digital goods or services.</p>

<p>Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have
benefited from the App Store ecosystem — including it’s [<em>sic</em>]
tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all
developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines
freely and we’re glad they’ve built such a successful business on
the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead
them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact
that these guidelines create a level playing field for all
developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make
every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they
can return Fortnite to the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was very clear this morning that Epic knew exactly what it was doing, and how Apple was likely to respond. In very short order after Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store, <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1293994211621167105">Epic filed a lawsuit</a>, which opens guns-a-blazing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1984, the fledgling Apple computer company released the
Macintosh — the first mass-market, consumer-friendly home
computer. The product launch was announced with a breathtaking
advertisement evoking George Orwell’s 1984 that cast Apple as a
beneficial, revolutionary force breaking IBM’s monopoly over the
computing technology market. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs introduced
the first showing of the 1984 advertisement by explaining, “it
appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope
to offer IBM a run for its money…. Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was
George Orwell right about 1984?”</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020, and Apple has become what it once railed
against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block
competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more
powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the
monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion,
Apple’s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology
monopolist in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s filing wastes little time. By page 5 it reaches the point where they accuse Apple of “illegal restraints” that keep Epic from providing its own competing iOS app store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic — and Fortnite’s users — are directly harmed by Apple’s
anti-competitive conduct. But for Apple’s illegal restraints,
Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which
would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated
store and would provide users the choice to use Epic’s or another
third-party’s in-app payment processing tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear, of course, what Epic <em>actually</em> hopes to get from Apple, either voluntarily or forced by the courts, but they’re asking for the whole shebang: they’re claiming it is illegal for iOS not to be as open to native third-party software as the Mac.</p>

<p>Epic also had a new commercial queued up that makes their argument much more artfully — it’s a strident parody of Apple’s iconic “1984” spot, with the obvious but still clever title <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4">Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite</a></em>. You really have to see it — Fortnite has a fun strong brand and they poured that into this. It closes with this title card:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation,
Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight
to stop 2020 from becoming “1984”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a preaching-to-the-choir aspect to Epic’s entire campaign, though. Both the ad and the legal filing seem directed toward an audience that enjoys decals of Calvin pissing on the Apple logo. The ad is in some ways a deft parody, and it is very saucy, but one thing it is not is funny.</p>

<p>Epic, in a very savvy way, is waging this war as much or more in the court of public opinion as they are in any court of law. And, ultimately, Apple stands to lose more in brand equity than in dollars, no matter how this turns out.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2020-08-13">
<p>Playing on Hard mode would be Apple flipping the kill switch to disable already-installed copies of Fortnite on iOS devices. I don’t think that was on the table as Apple’s opening move, and even now that Epic has revealed itself to be playing hardball, it would be heavy-handed, to say the least. What makes this a fair fight is that Fortnite is already installed on so many millions of iOS devices. Popularity is power. Removing Fortnite from the App Store (which, again, also blocks existing users from getting app updates) is a big move, but most iOS users who are in Fortnite’s target audience already have it installed. That’s not tenable in the long run, but it gives Epic and Apple time to spar without disrupting existing iOS Fortnite users from continuing to play.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-13"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

    <p>Similar opening statement to their suit against Apple, substituting “Don’t be evil” for “1984”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a
unique motto: “Don’t Be Evil”. Google’s Code of Conduct explained
that this admonishment was about “how we serve our users” and
“much more than that … it’s also about doing the right thing
more generally”. Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated
its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do
evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew
of markets it has grown to monopolize. This case is about doing
the right thing in one important area, the Android mobile
ecosystem, where Google unlawfully maintains monopolies in
multiple related markets, denying consumers the freedom to enjoy
their mobile devices — freedom that Google always promised
Android users would have.</p>

    <p>A while back I wrote about <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/04/continued-fraction-sqrt/">continued fractions of square roots</a>. That post cited a theorem that if <em>d</em> is not a perfect square, then the continued fraction representation of <em>d</em> is periodic. The period consists of a palindrome followed by 2⌊√<em>d</em>⌋. See that post for details and examples.</p>
<p>One thing the post did not address is the length of the period. The post gave the example that the continued fraction for √5 has period 1, i.e. the palindrome part is empty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/continued_fraction_sqrt5.svg" alt="\sqrt{5} = 2 + \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \ddots}}}}" width="228" height="128" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a theorem [1] that says this pattern happens if and only if <em>d</em> = <em>n</em>² + 1. That is, the continued fraction for √<em>d</em> is periodic with period 1 if and only if <em>d</em> is one more than a square. So if we wanted to find the continued fraction expression for √26, we know it would have period 1. And because each period ends in 2⌊√26⌋ = 10, we know all the coefficients after the initial 5 are equal to 10.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/continued_fraction_sqrt26.svg" alt="\sqrt{26} = 5 + \cfrac{1}{10+ \cfrac{1}{10+ \cfrac{1}{10+ \cfrac{1}{10+ \ddots}}}}" width="272" height="128" /></p>
