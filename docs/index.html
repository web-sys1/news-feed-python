    <p>Most project management software (a) takes a lot of time to configure, (b) is not built for cross-functional teams, and (c) takes focus away from releases. The status quo is that engineers spend precious time wading through tickets.</p>

<p>We’ve been dedicated to designing a modern and simple interface that just works for teams building rapidly. Tara AI helps engineers and teams deliver on planned releases with simple sprint planning, a unified view of tasks and a clear overview of daily priorities synced to Github.</p>

<p>We’re excited to be launching v1.0 to the DF community, <a href="https://tara.ai/?ref=daringfireball"><em>with no user or task limits, free of charge</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Antony Johnston — best known as the creator of the excellent and right-up-my-alley <em><a href="https://antonyjohnston.com/work/atomicblonde/">Atomic Blonde</a></em> — hosts a podcast devoted to writing, and he was kind enough to invite me on. I could talk about writing — what I do, how I do it — forever, even though, as I hope I made clear to Johnston, I don’t really fully understand how exactly I do what I do. The only thing I <em>really</em> understand about writing is that I need to do it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed having the opportunity to talk about this. If that sounds interesting to you, I bet you’ll dig listening.</p>

    <p>Speaking of podcasts, another month, another new album cover for <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>, the new thrice-weekly podcast with me and <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://dithering.fm/" class="noborder">
<img
    src = "/misc/2020/08/dithering-aug-2020.png"
    alt = "August 2020 cover art for Dithering, depicting a bunch of kids, in two groups, battling each other in a water balloon game of some sort."
    width = "500"
/></a></p>

<p>One reason Ben and I make for a good team, I think, is that even when we agree on something, we often see the issue from very different perspectives. But we don’t always agree, and to date, never less so than regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">this controversy</a> over Apple’s ban on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass streaming service from the App Store. We’ve had some crackerjack episodes these last few days — but our arguments are constructive, not destructive. What makes for an invigorating disagreement is the shared belief that you can only have confidence that your opinion is correct if you’re willing to honestly contemplate that you might be wrong. We’ve got that.</p>

<p>More good news, too, for the Dithering curious. The obvious downside to a paid subscription podcast ($5/month — cheap!) is that some prospective listeners naturally want to know what the show is like before paying. We’ve been thinking about this since we initially conceived of the show, and last week launched our solution: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/itunes/id1525886040">Dithering Preview</a>, a free podcast with the best clips from each month’s episodes.</p>

<p>You should be able to find it just by searching for “Dithering Preview” in your favorite podcast player, or use one of the handy shortcuts below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/itunes/id1525886040">Apple Podcasts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1525886040/dithering-preview">Overcast</a></li>

<li><a href="https://pca.st/pmet22cf">Pocket Casts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dithering.fm/preview/feed">RSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence, give an episode or two of Dithering Preview a listen, and you’ll get an honest taste of what the show is like. For those of you who’ve already subscribed, I thank you kindly for listening, and for helping to spread the word about the show.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1292822064139841536"><p>I wonder how many publishers in Apple News+ realize that the new iOS14 and MacOS Big Sur are by default intercepting traffic to their sites and sending it to the Apple News app instead.</p><p>This traffic interception has two interesting consequences: 1) Any strategic rationale that Apple News+ represents a separate channel/audience is now gone. This directly cannibalizes a publishers&rsquo; core subscription audience.</p><p>2) Apple has been touting privacy as its core attribute, particularly blocking cross-site tracking. In this case, not only is Apple engaging in cross-site tracking, but is doing so as a default opt-in buried in the settings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The setting is called &ldquo;Open Web Links in News.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a user I noticed it as I kept getting notices that Apple News had crashed, which is weird because I didn&rsquo;t have it open. But it was intercepting links I was opening in background on browser. What a weird experience. Who wants to open another whole app to read a single article?</p>

<p>Apple looks to be giving its own ad network a leg up on competitors with customer data that other ad networks can&rsquo;t access. In iOS 14, Apple Advertising appears to have a separate settings panel with a default-on setting. Other advertisers and ad networks on iOS, however, need to ask permission every single time.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is ridiculous. Their pear logo looks nothing like Apple&rsquo;s. Alas, this bullying isn&rsquo;t new.</p>

<p>Apfelkind (Apple Child) is a cafe in Bonn where parents can sip lattes while children play with toys or listen to storytellers. Its logo shows the outline of a child&rsquo;s face within a red apple &#x2013; with none of the characteristic bite marks of the electronics manufacturer&rsquo;s logo.</p>
<p>Yet when Apfelkind&rsquo;s owner, Christin R&ouml;mer, filed a trademark application for her company in 2011, Apple got in touch asking her to withdraw the request since customers could potentially confuse the two logos.</p>
<p>R&ouml;mer stood firm and a two-year legal correspondence ensued. Last week Apple withdrew its objection.</p>

But R&ouml;mer didn&rsquo;t want sign the contract. To do so would have forbidden her from manufacturing products related to computers - such as carrying cases for laptops, for example. But it was one sentence in particular that bothered the caf&eacute; owner.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to talk about it anymore, and would only be able to say that I have come to an agreement with Apple,&rdquo; she told DW.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.pcworld.com/article/262202/apple_vs_a_pl_tech_company_sues_online_polish_grocer_over_logo.html"><p>According to Telepolis, Apple is taking issue with the A.pl&rsquo;s logo, and is claiming that the grocer is trying to deliberately confuse customers by using Apple&rsquo;s well-known likeness and reputation. Considering Apple sells iPhones (and iPads, and MacBook Airs, and Mac OS X, and other non-edible technology items), and A.pl sells food (and cleaning products, and other items you might find in a grocery store), this seems like a bit of a stretch. I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that customers will mistake A.pl&rsquo;s products for iPhones, and vice-versa.</p></blockquote>

Best Buy, PayPal, and others often offer 15- or 20-percent off $50 or $100 cards, but those deals rarely surface for Apple Store cards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Discounted gift cards have been one reason offered in justification of Apple&rsquo;s 30% App Store cut.</p>

    <p>I have been an Apple user for 35 years. Do you have one minute for a little story? Thanks.</p>
<p>I have been trying to install your fucking OS update on my fucking watch for three fucking days now. First, I had to unpair and re-pair it because there wasn’t enough room for the update (even though I have very few apps on my watch). That was the only way to free up space because your storage management is for shit. Then it refused to update overnight despite telling me it was going to (in fairness, this wasn’t surprising—the iPad has been lying about updating itself overnight for ages). Now I’m trying to do the update manually, and I keep getting this fucking message:</p>
<p><img alt="Watch update error message" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200810-Watch%20update%20error%20message.png" title="Watch update error message" width="50%"/></p>
<p>So I deleted the downloaded Software Update so I can try again. Why should this work? I have no idea; it’s like restarting a Windows machine. While I was deleting, I noticed that Music was taking up a lot of space because the fucking Heavy Rotation playlist was turned on again, despite my having turned it off.</p>
<p>You should all be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8">Ben Gilbert, reporting yesterday for Business Insider</a> (italic emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This September, Microsoft plans to launch a major coup in the
video game business: The world’s first game streaming service with
a built-in library, Netflix-style. For $15 a month, you’ll be able
to stream over 100 games to smartphones and tablets — but it
won’t be available on Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><em>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because
Apple isn’t able to review each game that’s available through
Game Pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness">controversy over Basecamp’s Hey app</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Tim Cook being called to testify at an antitrust Congressional hearing</a> regarding App Store policies, and given the high profile of Xbox Game Pass, it’s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/200806/p45#a200806p45">has gotten a lot of attention</a>, almost all of it focused on taking the italicized paragraph from Business Insider at its word. But that’s Ben Gilbert’s interpretation, not a quote from Apple. Gilbert’s interpretation is not an unfair or sensationalized take on Apple’s statement, but it’s adding a “because” that Apple did not state. That entire sentence is <em>not</em> a paraphrase of something Apple said.</p>

<p>Here is Apple’s statement to Business Insider, apparently in its entirety. Apple seemingly sent this statement <em>only</em> to Business Insider, which itself is a bit unusual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for
customers to discover and download apps, and a great business
opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all
apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are
intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing
field to developers.</p>

<p>Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of
developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App
Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users
over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running this statement through my Applespeak-to-English decoder ring, what I hear is not that they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game separately. What I hear is that game streaming services are not allowed in the iOS App Store. Period, full stop. I don’t even think this has anything to do with whether Microsoft offers in-app subscriptions, or whether those subscriptions get a discount from the standard 70/30 split for the first year. I think Apple’s stance is that game streaming services like Microsoft’s xCloud project are simply verboten.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-07">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2.7">App Store guideline 4.2.7</a>, “Remote Desktop Clients”, seemingly makes this clear, too — it’s a written rule, not an unwritten one. This rule is why <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about">Steam Link</a> is in the App Store and Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia are not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is
    a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the
    user, and both the host device and client must be connected on
    a local and LAN-based network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like this: Business Insider asked Apple why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass. Apple didn’t say why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass, and instead gave a non-answer answer by describing what they do allow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… gaming services can absolutely launch on the App
Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable
to all developers, including submitting games individually for
review, and appearing in charts and search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Submitting games individually and appearing in charts and search — presumably App Store charts and search — is just an obfuscated way of saying that native iOS game apps are allowed in the iOS App Store. Well, duh. Everyone is distracted by the interpretation that Apple won’t allow Xbox Game Pass because they can’t review each game. It is a nonsensical justification, no doubt about that. But the comparison to Netflix or Spotify is beside the point. Of course Apple doesn’t and can’t review every movie on Netflix or every song on Spotify. But if you think about it, they <em>could</em> review every game on Xbox Game Pass. Even if it’s 100 games, they could look at them all. I’m sure they could find quite a few volunteers among the App Store reviewer corps to spend the time to play these games thoroughly.</p>

<p>The point is that streaming video and music services are allowed in the App Store; streaming software (games or otherwise) is not, unless it works over the web. <em>Apple just doesn’t want to say that.</em> Here, in my opinion, is how this conversation is best decoded:</p>

<p><strong>Business Insider</strong>: <em>Why are game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass not allowed in the App Store?</em></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong>: <em>Native iPhone games are allowed in the App Store. Native iPhone games are good because we review them individually, and they appear in App Store charts and search results.</em></p>

<p>It’s a perfect example of the difference between bullshit and a lie. Every word in Apple’s statement is true, but not a word of it answers why they won’t allow Xbox Game Pass or any other cloud game streaming service.</p>

<p>Apple would have been much better off saying nothing at all than offering this bullshit non-answer answer, that in fact was so easily and reasonably misconstrued. And, purely as a guess on my part, I think Apple realized this, which is why they didn’t send this statement to any other outlet and haven’t added a word of clarification since.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just about the money, or even partially about the money<sup id="fnr2-2020-08-07"><a href="#fn2-2020-08-07">2</a></sup> — which certainly wouldn’t be shocking — but we don’t know, because Apple didn’t say, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/">neither did Microsoft in its own testily worded statement</a>, which, unlike Apple’s statement, was distributed to numerous news outlets.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2020-08-07">
<p>I really hope it’s <em>not</em> about the money. I mean let’s face it, no matter what the story is here, it’s sad in some way. Microsoft has made something technically impressive and cool and fun, and millions of Xbox-playing iOS users would love to play these games on their iPhones and iPads and but they can’t because of some sort of business or strategic shit that’s between Apple and Microsoft. But if it’s really just a dispute about goddamn money — between, of all companies, two of the richest in the history of the world — man, that’s just tawdry. It’s just two <em>corporations</em> fighting over one more stream of money neither even knows what to do with atop the Scrooge McDuckian mountains of cash they each already have flooding into their coffers each day. That’s business, but that’s a stale saltine of a story.</p>

<p>But what if it’s <em>not</em> Apple being a dick about money? What if it’s Apple being a dick about control?</p>

<p>That’s not cold and dry — that’s a goddamn sizzling hot juicy steak of a story. That’s <em>personal</em>. For one thing it would explain the pissy, petulant tone of Microsoft’s statement. Maybe Microsoft went into this whole endeavor gearing up for a knockdown drag-out knife-fight negotiation about how exactly to split the money, and Apple just went stone cold <a href="https://youtu.be/wPmTp9up26w?t=87">Michael Corleone on them</a>: “<em>You can have our answer now, if you like. Our offer is this: nothing. Not even the 30 percent fee for the gaming subscription, which we would appreciate if you put up your ass.</em>” The idea being, in this scenario, that Apple has something Microsoft needs, Microsoft has nothing to offer in return that Apple wants, and so Microsoft just has to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZhj7rPPzxg">sit there grooving on it</a>, stuck with a premium paid subscription service that’s only available on the low-rent mobile platform <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">where people don’t pay for things</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is clearly being a dick to Microsoft about <em>something</em> here, and if it’s platform control not money, well by god at least there’s some delicious poetic justice at play. That’d be a veritable vintage bottle of wine being uncorked. Not having any control over the world’s most lucrative computing platform and wanting something from the company that does — and which has a real taste for exerting its dictatorial control over said platform in mercurial fashion — would fucking suck, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2020-08-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the first days after she was elected governor of South Dakota in 2018, Kristi Noem had been working to ensure that President Trump would come to Mount Rushmore for a fireworks-filled July 4 extravaganza.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2018/04/24/president-donald-trump-mount-rushmore-trumpmore/544597002/">the president had told her</a> in the Oval Office that he aspired to have his image etched on the monument. And last year, a White House aide reached out to the governor’s office with a question, according to a Republican official familiar with the conversation: What’s the process to add additional presidents to Mount Rushmore? […]</p>

<p>In private, the efforts to charm Mr. Trump were more pointed, according to a person familiar with the episode: Ms. Noem greeted him with a four-foot replica of Mount Rushmore that included a fifth presidential likeness: his.</p>

    <p>A major college conference has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/08/mac-fall-football-postponed/">canceled its fall sports:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Mid-American Conference postponed its football season,</strong> the conference announced Saturday, becoming the first Football Bowl Subdivision league to decide not to hold games this fall because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8230;.“<strong>The decision is grounded in the core values of the Conference that prioritize student-athlete well-being,</strong> an area the MAC has traditionally taken a leadership role,” Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s good to see a college sports conference putting its athletes first even if it means losing—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many MAC schools rely on the revenue generated through guarantee games — when a Power Five school pays another program to play it during the nonconference schedule. <strong>Most of these games have been canceled</strong> because all of the Power Five leagues have chosen to play one or zero nonconference games this season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, I see. Without any of these guarantee games, football suddenly becomes a money loser for MAC schools. And just as suddenly, the well-being of the players becomes paramount and the season is canceled. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Big Ten has canceled its football season too. I&#8217;m sure all the other dominoes will now fall as well.</p>
<p>With no fans in the stands, I imagine that football is a money loser even for Power Five schools. That probably made it a lot easier to do the right thing.</p>

    <p>Most of Apple’s early laptops were, like today’s MacBooks, <em>complete</em> Macs. The premise was: “Let’s engineer a Mac that’s like the one on your desk, but put it in a single package with screen, keyboard, pointing device, and battery.” My first laptop was a PowerBook 160 and it did everything my old Mac SE did (and much, much more).</p>
<p>The PowerBook Duo was different. It wasn’t trying to be the Mac on your desk. <span id="more-12646"></span> Introduced in 1992,<sup id="fnref-12646-160"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-160" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> it was the MacBook Air or one-port MacBook of its time—all compromise in a quest to be as thin and light as possible. If you wanted the absolutely smallest, lightest Mac laptop you could find, you got a PowerBook Duo and dealt with the weirdness.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duo-air-buddies.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Separated at birth? The PowerBook Duo was the MacBook Air of its day, prioritizing thinness and lightness over “required” features.</figcaption></figure><p>How small and how light? By today’s standards <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2897715/the-new-macbook-is-cool-but-the-powerbook-duo-was-cooler.html">the PowerBook Duo was laughably large</a>, but 1992 was a different time. My first PowerBook weighed seven pounds; the first PowerBook Duo weighed four. It  was also 1.4 inches thick—more than an inch thinner than my PowerBook.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a complete Mac. It had a shrunken-down keyboard and trackball, and only a single standard port. (Sound familiar, MacBook fans?) There was no support for floppy drives, external hard drives or monitors. For all of that stuff, you needed to connect it to a docking station.</p>
<p>Today we don’t flinch at the idea of a computer without a built-in floppy drive, but back in the mid-90s, floppies were the currency of the realm. <em>Even six years later,</em> people screamed bloody murder when the original iMac was released lacking a floppy drive. The Duo? Nope. (If you needed access to floppies, you’d need to buy an external disk drive.)</p>
<p>It also didn’t have a headphone jack! This one seems completely bananas now—I can’t imagine working on a laptop out in public without plugging in headphones. But back then, we didn’t really play music on our computers—this was the Walkman era—so Apple got away with shaving that port off.</p>
<p>The only standard port on the Duo, hiding behind a little door that you could rotate and turn into a foot to help angle the keyboard perfectly for carpal tunnel syndrome<sup id="fnref-12646-rsi"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-rsi" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>, was a single Mac serial port. That wasn’t nothing, because you could use it to connect to a modem (if you didn’t pay for the optional internal modem) or a printer or even a very slow local-area network via LocalTalk. But, that was it.</p>
<p>And this is where the PowerBook Duo got…interesting. It remains the only Mac to be built with an Apple docking station in mind. Apple sold two of them, and third-party vendors filled in the gaps with all sorts of other contraptions, all connected via the Duo’s most important (and most nonstandard) port, the 156-pin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot">Processor Direct Slot</a>.</p>
<p>When I say “Mac docking station,” you probably can imagine what I’m talking about. When I was a full-time PowerBook and MacBook user, I used a bunch of third-party ones—you’d connect your monitor, speakers, hard drive, and other stuff to a plastic frame and then slide your laptop into it to make the connections and hopefully not ruin the ports on the back or sides.</p>
<p>And yes, the Duo had those kinds of docks. It was the original Dongletown. Apple’s <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duo_minidock.html">Duo MiniDock</a> clipped on the back and added a modem jack, audio-in and audio-out plugs, a SCSI port, two serial ports, video out, ADB for keyboards and mice, a floppy-disk port, and an AC adapter. (If that seemed like too much, there was also a Duo Floppy Adapter, that added a floppy-disk port <em>and</em> an ADB port.)</p>
<p>But docking stations like that are kind of boring. What you wanted to do, if you were John Sculley-era Apple, was to create a big, bold docking station that could transform that tiny PowerBook Duo into a full-fledged desktop Mac. You wanted to create the <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duodock.html">Duo Dock</a>, the accessory that makes the PowerBook Duo more significant than it would be if it were just Apple’s first attempt to make a tiny laptop.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duodock.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Duo Dock (with Duo inside). The two-tone color scheme matched PowerBook and monitor alike.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what MacUser’s Russell Ito wrote in his launch story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let’s get one thing clear: This thing looks weird. We’re not talking technology or functionality, mind you, just aesthetics. From its two-tone finish (platinum on top, granite on the bottom—according to Apple, the top will match your monitor, and the bottom, your PowerBook), to its partially melted-looking lid, to its strange cylindrical feet sticking out the sides, this is easily the most visually “unusual” computer Apple has produced since the Lisa.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I prefer to think of the Duo Dock as a front-loading VCR that takes laptops instead of videocassettes<sup id="fnref-12646-vcr"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-vcr" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>. Because that’s how it worked. You closed your Duo and inserted it into the tray of the Duo Dock, which would eventually click into place and pull itself snugly closed. In a decade when Apple never skimped on custom intercapped names for their products, the system that locked the Duo in place in the Duo Dock was called PowerLatch.</p>
<p>The Duo Dock packed in all the parts of a desktop Mac that weren’t present on the Duo. There was a floppy drive (not just a connector, like on the MiniDock), a hard-drive bay for a single 3.5-inch half-height drive, two NuBus slots—that’s right, you could install add-on cards that the computer could use when it was docked—space for additional video RAM (to drive larger monitors), and even a slot for a floating-point unit (FPU) chip. This was a dock that could actually expand your computer’s central processor and make it faster.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerlatch-duo.gif?ssl=1" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Patented PowerLatch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology.</figcaption></figure><p>That level of integration came at a cost: You basically needed to shut down your laptop to eject it from the Dock. If you pressed the eject button on the Dock—yes, there was an eject button—it would tell the Duo to shut down, and you’d be prompted to save your files. Once the laptop was off, the ejection process would start. (When you inserted a Duo in the Dock, it would automatically reconnect you to your file servers, which was nice.)</p>
<p>Still, the idea of the Duo Dock was kind of brilliant. I frequently hear the hosts of <a href="http://atp.fm/">one of my favorite podcasts</a> debate the merits of going full-time with a laptop versus having a separate laptop and desktop. The Duo tried to provide the best of both worlds, with a light laptop that could inherit the traits of a desktop Mac when it was sucked into its little plastic house.</p>
<p>The lifespan of the entire PowerBook Duo product line from introduction to discontinuation was less than five years. But it lives on in reruns of NewsRadio, Seinfeld, and quintessential mid-90s films like “The Net” (which was shot at Macworld Expo San Francisco) and “Hackers.”</p>
<p>This time period coincides with my first few years working at MacUser magazine. I had never seen a Duo in the wild before I started to work at MacUser, and even there, they were rare. In an era that stands among the worst in Apple’s history, the full-featured PowerBook was a hit, but not the Duo. It lived off in its own parallel universe, a niche within a niche.</p>
<p>The Duo line was discontinued in early 1997, before Steve Jobs got the chance to kill it himself. Though <a href="https://512pixels.net/2011/09/modern-docking-station/">you could make the argument</a> that Apple’s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162442/2011/09/apples_thunderbolt_display_a_compelling_device_for_2011_macbook_air.html?lsrc=top_1">Thunderbolt Display</a> was a MacBook docking station disguised as a display, we never really saw the Duo Dock’s like again.</p>

    <p>Donald Trump has issued some executive orders related to coronavirus aid, and I suppose we&#8217;re all supposed to take them seriously. But why? To paraphrase an old saying, the stuff that&#8217;s legal is unimportant and the stuff that&#8217;s important is illegal. It&#8217;s just more Trump blather designed to keep the spotlight on him.</p>
<p>But I suppose you want a little more than that. Fine. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first EO provides a $400 unemployment bonus. This is important, but almost certainly not legal. The money is supposed to be transferred from unspent FEMA accounts, which is a transfer that Trump probably can&#8217;t make. What&#8217;s more, Trump wants states to pick up 25 percent of the cost, and he definitely can&#8217;t do that. The Supreme Court made that clear when it struck down Obamacare&#8217;s Medicaid mandate. What&#8217;s even yet more, even if all this were legal, the money would only last five weeks.</li>
<li>The second EO defers payroll taxes from September through December. This is probably legal, but deeply trivial. The amount of money involved is small. It helps only people who are already employed. And the deferred taxes have to be paid back in a lump sum in January. It&#8217;s pointless.</li>
<li>A third EO asks federal agencies to &#8220;consider&#8221; whether evictions should be temporarily halted. This is obviously legal, but has no impact at all.</li>
<li>Finally, the fourth EO defers student loan payments through the end of the year. This is legal, and maybe even modestly important. However, like the payroll tax deferral, it will primarily help out people who are the most likely to still have jobs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am deeply tired of these idiotic Republican games. Because that&#8217;s all they seem to be to them: games. There are millions of Americans in deep, deep trouble because of the coronavirus, and they&#8217;re in even deeper trouble than they should be thanks to Trump&#8217;s gross mismanagement of the crisis. But none of that seems to matter to any of them. Human suffering is just another political lever to be used in service of God only knows what political aim they have at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all so appalling and loathsome. I can barely stand reading about it any longer, let alone writing about it.</p>

    <p>Here’s the coronavirus death toll through August 9. You may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post new numbers on Sunday. I normally do them the night before, but on Saturday night I was tired and it just didn&#8217;t happen. Then Sunday was crash day and I didn&#8217;t fully wake up until about 2 pm. By then it seemed kind of pointless, so I just skipped it. Today, however, we have nice, fresh numbers and Argentina is starting to look really, really bad.</p>
<p>The raw data from Johns Hopkins is <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv">here.</a></p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>After posting my <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/08/development-shortcuts-and-warhol/">Warhol shortcut</a>, I got a couple of good suggestions for improvements. They overlapped to some extent, so I put them together into <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/74ccef08af784e78abfe8a4448f8ae9b">a new Warhol</a>.</p>
<p>First, David Sparks pointed out that it would be helpful to end the shortcut by opening Photos so you can both see the new image and do something with it. And Leddy, <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/dr-drang-s-warhol-shortcut/7901">in the Automators discussion forum</a>, had a suggestion for running it both the Share Sheet and directly from Shortcuts without running into memory constraints. As I was trying out Leddy’s suggestion, I learned that Warhol <em>wasn’t</em> constrained by memory when run from the Share Sheet. (Apparently I’d run into that problem during one of the the early iterations of Warhol and never went back to check if the later improvements made it efficient enough to avoid the memory constraint.)</p>
<p>So now Warhol can be run from both Shortcuts and the Share Sheet in Photos. If it’s run from Shortcuts, it finishes by opening Photos. If it’s run from the Share Sheet, Photos is already open.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in the improved Warhol:</p>

    <p class="">Samual Axon at Arts Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/" target="_blank">published an interview</a> with Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) chief John Giannandrea concerning the state of AI at Apple.</p><p class="">If you go back enough years, you can see plenty of articles and hear podcasts where I bemoaned Apple’s ability to compete with AI given the fact that they were not willing, for instance, to throw all of our pictures together so they would have one massive server database for the AI gods. Instead, Apple always said they were going to protect user privacy, and while I agreed with the sentiment, I worried about its long term effects.</p><p class="">However, Apple has been turning my opinion around on this <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/6/privacy-and-big-data" target="_blank">over the past several years</a>. This latest article settles my mind entirely on the question. The point that comes through several times is that Apple believes doing AI analysis on a device actually gives the best user experience because the computing is getting done closer to the user. </p>

<figure class="block-animation-none">
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"

    <span>&#147;</span>Yes, I understand this perception of bigger models in data centers somehow are more accurate, but it’s actually wrong. It’s actually technically wrong. It’s better to run the model close to the data, rather than moving the data around. And whether that’s location data—like what are you doing— [or] exercise data—what’s the accelerometer doing in your phone—it’s just better to be close to the source of the data, and so it’s also privacy preserving.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; John Giannandrea</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="">This is the first time I’ve heard someone from Apple explain how their AI model is better because it is faster, and the privacy benefits are icing on the cake. Privacy has always been at the front of that argument. It’s never been the “also”, until now.</p><p class="">I think the reason Apple is starting to talk more about this is the significant lead they have with Apple silicon.  I’m just not convinced any other company can pull off AI on the device the way Apple is right now. If anyone at Apple were to ask me, I would say push down the gas pedal with on-device AI as hard as you possibly can. </p>

    <p>August tends to be right in the middle of the summer doldrums, the time when everybody goes on vacation and thus news—including tech announcements—are few and far between. Then again, 2020 isn’t your average year, so perhaps it’s not a shock that this week saw a departure from the norm with Apple announcing a surprisingly substantial <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3199629/imacs-release-features-specs-pricing-faq.html">update to the iMac</a>.</p>
<p>My colleague Jason Snell has <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html">already expounded upon what the revamp to Apple’s popular desktop means for the future of that product</a>, but I think it’s worth it to take a moment and see what we can extrapolate from this update and learn about the future of Apple’s <em>other</em> devices. Apple is no stranger to introducing updates in one device that eventually migrate to the rest of its lineup, even from the Mac to the iPhone and iPad and vice versa, and this iMac update is certainly no exception.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3570430/what-the-imac-refresh-can-tell-us-about-apples-future-products.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/08/images-of-concentric-circles/">previous post</a> looked at the images of concentric circles under functions defined by power series. The terms of these series have the form</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>z</em><sup>θ(<em>n</em>)</sup> / θ(<em>n</em>)</p>
<p>where θ(<em>n</em>) is a rapidly increasing function of <em>n</em>. These series are thin (technically, lacunary) because all the terms between values of θ(<em>n</em>) are missing.</p>
<p>The previous post used factorials and powers of 2 as the thinning function. This post uses Fibonacci numbers. It differs from the previous post by using more circles and by making all the circles the same color rather than using matplotlib&#8217;s default colors.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s the plot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/hakmem_fibonacci2.png" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>It looks sorta like a tree with ingrown bark.</p>
<p>The code to produce the plot was the same as the code in the previous post with the following changes.</p>
<pre>
    def fib(n):
        phi = (1 + 5**0.5)/2
        return int(phi**n/5**0.5 + 0.5)

    for r in linspace(0, 1, 60):
        z = f(fib, r*exp(1j*theta))
        plt.plot(z.real, z.imag, 'b', alpha=0.6)
</pre>
<p>The function <code>fib</code> above uses Binet&#8217;s formula to compute Fibonacci numbers.</p>

    <p>So let’s just get this out of the way: Rogue Amoeba was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">last week’s sponsor</a> here at DF but the sponsorship was for Loopback, for which I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/09/loopback">just posted</a> my end-of-the-week thank-you. But this week they <em>also</em> released a major update to another of their excellent Mac audio utilities, SoundSource, and it’s well worth your attention.</p>

<p>SoundSource is on my short list of Mac utilities that I don’t know what I’d do without. It’s the system-wide audio menu item that ought to be built into MacOS. It gives you instant volume control to every output and input device connected to your Mac, and per-application controls for controlling audio input and output. When I wrote about SoundSource 4 last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/soundsource-4">I noted the interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SoundSource is also a great example of a distinctive, branded UI
that still looks and feels in every way like a standard Mac app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SoundSource 5 is a solid upgrade on functional grounds alone — just the audio features that are its reason for being. But the UI changes and tweaks in version 5 are delightful, and too long to list here. (E.g. the pin icon animation, and the gear menu animation.) The UI is so good that I encourage anyone who appreciates great UI design to download the demo and explore, examine, and think about the interface details of this app even if you have no interest in its features. </p>

<p>It’s both great UI design in the abstract, and a hall-of-fame caliber example of a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps">Mac-assed Mac app</a> in particular.</p>

    <p>My thanks to Rogue Amoeba for sponsoring DF last week to promote Loopback, their amazing Mac audio utility that makes it easy to move audio between applications. Stuck on Zoom calls? Pipe in music and sound effects, or enhance your microphone. Podcasters, merge your mic with other audio sources, then pass it all on to remote guests. Loopback makes seemingly impossible audio routing a breeze.</p>

<p>With virtual audio devices that are usable anywhere on MacOS, Loopback can route audio between software applications and hardware devices alike. The intuitive wire-based interface gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board, all with no cables required. For studio techs, live streamers, and so many others, Loopback is essential.</p>

<p>Download the free trial, then use coupon code <strong>LOOPFIRE</strong> to save $20 when you purchase by August 15. $20 discount, just for DF readers.</p>

    <p>Apple, in its legal filing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers encountering Applicant’s Mark are likely to associate
the mark with Apple. Applicant’s Mark consists of a minimalistic
fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind
Apple’s famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial
impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/misc/2020/08/prepear-apple-comparison.png">Here’s the comparison</a>. I could actually see this being a reasonable objection if Prepear were selling computers or phones or watches. But they’re a recipe app. Their logo clearly looks like a pear, not an apple, and their pear does not even look like an Apple-logo-like pear.</p>

<p>Back in the old days Apple didn’t even pursue legal action against the <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/banana2.html">Banana Junior series of personal computers</a>, and their logo was <a href="/misc/2020/08/banana.jpg">a six-color banana</a>.</p>

    <p>Mark Gurman <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1292147475201941505">tweeted a reminder</a> of this story he reported back in March:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the
internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster
fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new
offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud
streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services
are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5
billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there,
and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5
and Destiny 2.</p>

<p>Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with
the chipmaker’s GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said:
“Ask Apple.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg got the same boilerplate statement from Apple then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/applespeak_to_english_xbox_game_pass">that Business Insider got last week about Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

    <p>Simon Sharwood, writing for The Register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toshiba has finally and formally exited the laptop business.</p>

<p>Toshiba has made laptops since 1985 and claims to have been the
first to make a mass-market computer in the now-familiar clamshell
form factor. By the 1990s the company was producing solid
workhorses in the Satellite range and started to make meaningful
stretches of mobile work possible with the small, thin and light
Portégé range.</p>

<p>Those products saw Toshiba lead the world for laptop market share
through the late 1990s and retain that position for much of the
2000s. Even as the PC market consolidated in that decade, Toshiba
was often ranked among the top five of all PC vendors despite only
ever dabbling in desktops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you go back far enough, Toshiba’s early-era laptops were truly groundbreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Free bestselling ebooks</strong><br />
If you are an Amazon Prime member, you are entitled to two free Kindle ebooks per month from a selection of 9 popular bestselling books chosen by Amazon that month. This same program, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/firstreads?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">First Reads</a>, also gives you access to free short stories and Audible readings for listening, commissioned as Amazon originals. I can usually find at least one book I am interested in each month, and since it is free, why not? —KK</p>
<p><strong>Drive &amp; listen</strong><br />
This cool website, <a href="https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Drive &amp; Listen</a>, pulls dashboard cam videos from YouTube and pairs them up with local music channels so that you can feel like you’re cruising around in a foreign city, blasting the radio, all while sitting at your desk. — CD</p>
<p><strong>Improved Dictanote</strong><br />
I recommended <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/dictanote-pro-lifetime-subscription?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Dictanote</a> a few weeks ago. It’s a Chrome-based application that converts speech to text. It’s faster and less buggy than my Mac’s built-in dictation. Recently, Dictanote released a Google Chrome extension that lets you use Dictanote within almost any website. Now I’m using it to answer emails in Gmail, which has been a big time saver. It doesn’t work with Google Docs, which is unfortunate, but for longer form speech-to-text writing I use Dictanote’s notebook and copy and paste the text (in fact, I’m using the notebook to write this recommendation). It’s $19, and because I’m such a terrible typist, it paid for itself within the first day or two. — MF</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the boss radio sound of KHJ 93 Los Angeles</strong><br />

The DJs were all vocal virtuosos, and the most talented of the bunch was a guy by the name of “The Real Don Steele.” Almost all of these broadcasts have been lost to time, but fortunately, some people recorded KHJ on their tape recorders in the 1960s, and the recordings found their way to the Internet. The Internet Archive has a <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%2293%20KHJ%22&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">couple of recordings</a> from the 1960s of Steele’s show on KHJ.

<p><strong>Opaque white ink</strong><br />
In my workshop and studio, I label boxes, shelves, drawers, cases, bins, and parts with a very dense white “ink” which is really white correction fluid in a stubby pen. White is usually much more legible than black, but white ink is much more difficult to apply heavy enough to cover any surface. These <a href="https://geni.us/BfQqB?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Pentel Presto Jumbo Correction Pens</a> do a fantastic job applying thick non-drippy white paint via a fine point tip, and are small enough to carry in my workshop apron. They draw perfectly opaque white on any surface, instantly, even vertical surfaces. I have not found anything else that will do that. — KK</p>

<p class="">Wow, are you feeling nostalgic for your old Mac? The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/felixrieseberg/macintosh.js" target="_blank"><span>macintosh.js project just released a JavaScript emulator</span></a>&nbsp;that runs Mac OS 8 emulated on a 1991 Macintosh Quadra. It works! I had several minutes of nostalgia—followed by several minutes of realizing things are a lot easier now.</p>
