<p>Daniel Goleman was a science reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>, was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and received the American Psychological Association’s Lifetime Achievement Award for his media writing. Here’s advice from his book, <a href="https://geni.us/emotional-iq"><em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware of your emotions as they occur</strong><br />
“A belligerent samurai, an old Japanese tale goes, once challenged a Zen master to explain the concept of heaven and hell. The monk replied with scorn, ‘You’re nothing but a lout — I can’t waste my time with the likes of you!’</p>
<p>His very honor attacked, the samurai flew into a rage and, pulling his sword from its scabbard, yelled &#8216;I could kill you for your impertinence.’<br />
&#8216;That,’ the monk calmly replied, &#8216;is hell.’</p>
<p>Startled at seeing the truth in what the master pointed out about the fury that had him in its grip, the samurai calmed down, sheathed his sword, and bowed, thanking the monk for the insight.</p>
<p>&#8216;And that,’ said the monk, &#8216;is heaven.’</p>
<p>The sudden awakening of the samurai to his own agitated state illustrates the crucial difference between being caught up in a feeling and becoming aware that you are being swept away by it. Socrates’s injunction &#8216;Know thyself’ speaks to the keystone of emotional intelligence: awareness of one’s own feelings as they occur.”</p>
<p><strong>Lead by persuading people to work toward a common goal</strong><br />
“Leadership is not domination, but the art of persuading people to work toward a common goal.”</p>
<p><strong>Understand the value of sadness</strong><br />
“[Sadness] enforces a kind of reflective retreat from life’s busy pursuits, and leaves us in a suspended state to mourn the loss, mull over its meaning, and, finally, make the psychological adjustments and new plans that will allow our lives to continue.”</p>
<p><strong>Understand that worrying isn&#8217;t magic</strong><br />
“The worry habit is reinforcing in the same sense that superstitions are. Since people worry about many things that have a very low probability of actually occurring — a loved one dying in a plane crash, going bankrupt, and the like —there is, to the primitive limbic brain at least, something magical about it. Like an amulet that wards off some anticipated evil, the worry psychologically gets the credit for preventing the danger it obsesses about.“</p>

    <p class="">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/"><span>released an update to the iMac today</span></a>. I’d rate this one as “slightly more” than a speed bump.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The processors are now 10th generation Intel CPU’s for all models.</p></li><li><p class="">Spinning drives are gone … almost. There is no model sold solely with a spinning drive. The low end is a 256GB SSD. Although the Fusion drive still lives.</p></li><li><p class="">The FaceTime camera is upgraded to the same 1080p camera in the iMac Pro. I’ve shot video for some of the Field Guides with that camera. It’s a nice upgrade, particularly during these strange times.</p></li><li><p class="">The iMac now has the T2 chip. Hooray.</p></li><li><p class="">You can spec the RAM up to 128GB and the storage up to 8TB (for <em>just</em> an additional $2,400.00).</p></li></ul><p class="">Overall, a nice update. It’s nice to see Apple giving spec-bump updates to its hardware. That said, there are lots of rumors about a redesign of the iMac in the pipeline. I’m guessing that will arrive with the first Silicon iMacs. IF it is going to be a touch screen, wouldn’t it be cool if they put it on a hinge like the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-studio-2/8SBJXM0M58T4"><span>Microsoft Surface Studio</span></a>?</p><p class="">If you need a new iMac, these look great.

<blockquote cite="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/"><p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity, next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And now the stunning Retina 5K display on the 27-inch iMac features True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts the color temperature of the display to match a user&rsquo;s ambient lighting.</p>
<p>The new iMac offers a nano-texture glass option &mdash; first introduced on Pro Display XDR &mdash; for even better viewing under various lighting conditions, such as a bright room or indirect sunlight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe the best news here is that it is no longer possible to get a spinning hard disk in any Mac. Recent versions of MacOS, whether because of system changes or <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2019/09/12/analysis-apfs-enumeration-performance-on-rotational-hard-drives">APFS</a>, simply <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/11/27/poor-mac-performance-without-a-ssd/">do not work acceptably</a> when running on hard disks.

<p>Alas, storage is still way overpriced. The $1,800 base model has a 256 GB SSD, and <em>upgrading</em> to 1 TB costs $400. Quality 1 TB SSDs retail for around $100 these days.</p>

<p>You can get 128GB worth of DDR4 for around &pound;600 on Amazon, Apple basically wants to charge you the cost of another whole iMac for it &#x2013; &pound;2400!!</p>
<p>Really hope repairability laws will compel Apple to make RAM and storage user upgradable across their line, a 4x markup on retail prices for commodity parts like RAM is just not right.</p>

    <p>What is the most effective thing an individual can do about climate change? There are lots of possible answers: what you eat, how you vote, where and how you live, how you travel, and so on. Every one of them matters. For Americans, at this moment, the one that matters most may be how you vote.</p><p>But among the steps most immediately within many people’s control, one of them is <em>planting trees</em>. Yes, there <a href="https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/01/13/plant-a-trillion-trees/content.html">are cautions</a> about doing this in the wrong way, or in the wrong places, or in ignoring the legacies of long-standing biases in zoning and city planning. (That is: It’s easy to plant trees in spacious residential neighborhoods; it’s harder when there’s only a narrow strip of ground between the street and a building front.) But overall, step-by-step reforestation can potentially be a significant help, which is why Deb Fallows and I have chronicled a number of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/599764/?utm_source=feed">local efforts</a> toward <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/planting-a-trail-of-giants/601276/?utm_source=feed">that end</a>.</p><p>I am chagrined to say that until I looked into it, I had no idea that the second-largest city in the nation—Los Angeles, with its population of nearly 4 million people spread out over roughly 500 square miles—has a very ambitious program to use tree planting as an axis to connect job creation, climate sustainability, urban renewal, and economic equity and inclusion. (Perhaps it would have helped if I’d read at least the headline of <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/los-angeles-green-new-deal-forest-officer/">a very good <em>Mother Jones</em> story</a> by Jackie Flynn Mogensen last year. The headline was, “Los Angeles, a City Known for Its Freeways, Is About to Plant a Shit Ton of Trees.”)</p><p>As it happened, I learned about the LA program largely by accident. The smallish Southern California town of Redlands had set an also-ambitious goal, of helping school children there plant more than 12,000 trees, which I wrote <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/599764/?utm_source=feed">about when it was announced last year</a>. The seedlings were purchased; a computerized way to map and track each one’s progress was set; and they were supposed to be passed out to school children on Earth Day this past April. That plan naturally hit a roadblock when California schools were shut down. As an alternative, the backers of the effort,  including the University of Redlands and the tech company Esri, managed <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/alumni/trees-please/">to give away</a> thousands of trees in June. But still some 4,000 seedling trees went unclaimed.</p><p>Mainly through the efforts of our friend <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/alumni/meet-the-staff/shelli-stockton/">Shelli Stockton</a>, of the University of Redlands, those little trees ended up last month in the hands of an organization called <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/">City Plants</a> in Los Angeles (as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Wr4rbwqaI&amp;feature=youtu.be">this video</a>). City Plants, which is part of the LA city government, is part of a broader LA effort toward radical expansion of the “urban forest” cover in this famously sunbaked part of the world.</p><p>I talked this week with <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/our-team/">Rachel O’Leary</a>, a native Angeleno who now directs City Plants, and with Rachel Malarich, a longtime expert in urban forestry who last year was named the city’s first-ever <a href="https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-names-rachel-malarich-la%E2%80%99s-first-ever-city-forest-officer">City Forest Officer</a>. Here is what they told me about what they are doing, and why it might matter elsewhere.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><em>How City Plants started</em>: Last year, in presenting his “Green New Deal” vision for the city (which you can download in <a href="https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf">full PDF version here</a>), Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti set out a tree-planting campaign as one element of a larger sustainability-and-jobs strategy. The plan set a target to “plant and maintain” at least 90,000 trees across the city by 2021, and to keep planting trees at a rate of 20,000 per year. This was largely initially based on the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/38102">“Million Trees” initiative</a> under Garcetti’s predecessor, Antonio Villaraigosa, but has evolved over the past decade to focus on planting the "right tree in the right place." Garcetti's Green New Deal also was explicitly focused on “canopy equity”—that is, of extending more of the benefits of large-tree cover to neighborhoods that are now typified by asphalt and concrete rather than greenery.</p><figure class="right"><img alt="" height="480" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/08/TreeSign/9262ffef7.png" width="350"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of Shelli Stockton</figcaption></figure><p><em>What it does:</em> The City Plants program, as part of the larger urban-forestry program, offers trees to residents of Los Angeles at no cost. Angelenos can get up to seven free “<a href="http://www.cityplants.org/our-programs/yard-trees/">yard trees</a>” for their own property, which they are expected to plant and care for themselves (with instructions like those shown in this picture). They can also request free “<a href="http://www.cityplants.org/our-programs/street-trees/street-trees-for-your-neighborhood/">street trees</a>,” which a City Plants team will plant for them. (Residents must agree to water the trees for five years.)</p><p>For the labor involved in planting and handling the trees, City Plants coordinates <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/partners/">with a variety</a> of nonprofit and neighborhood groups —of which its major partner is the <a href="https://www.lacorps.org/">LA Conservation Corps</a>. This LACorps is designed to give young people workplace skills, while they work on projects of larger community value.</p><p><em>How is it financed?</em> From a variety of public and private sources (<a href="https://www.cityplants.org/sponsors/">info here</a>), but mainly by LA’s main public utility, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or LADWP. Long-standing policy in California requires utility companies to underwrite energy-efficiency programs, including tree planting. LADWP has supported tree planting and innovations in urban forestry in Los Angeles for over a decade. The rationale for including trees as energy-savers, which you can find in longer and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/research/highlights/highlights_display.php?in_high_id=688">more detailed form here</a>, is not just that tree growth stores carbon directly, as the trees mature. It is also that leafed-out tree cover reduces electricity and water use, especially the demand for air-conditioning. With support from LADWP, City Plants has an online calculator in which residents enter their street address, and get estimates of energy-bill savings from planting trees, in real time.</p><p>“Trees are one of the least expensive, and most powerful, tools we have for improving our environment,” Rachel Malarich told me. “More and more research is showing how important a good, healthy tree canopy cover is for our communities as a whole—and how important it will be not just for our health right now but for our resilience in the face of a changing climate.” (Malarich went into more detail on these features in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/los-angeles-green-new-deal-forest-officer/">the <em>Mother Jones</em></a> interview.)  </p><figure><img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/IMG_7420_copy/4df5583be.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of City Plants</figcaption></figure><p><em>The program’s other ambitions:</em> The 90,000-tree program concentrates on the parts of LA that are now the least forested and most parched. These are of course generally the lowest-income areas, and the most likely to become broiling “heat islands” because of climate change. The official goal, set out in the Green New Deal document, is to “Increase tree canopy in areas of greatest need by at least 50% by 2028 to grow a more equitable urban forest that provides cooling, public health, habitat, energy savings, and other benefits.”</p><p>I asked Rachel Malarich how that would be possible, considering that many areas now short on trees are also short on areas to plant them. The extensive suburban-style portions of Los Angeles were designed to include leafy glades; others have barely an unpaved square inch to support plant growth.</p><p>“Trees need space to grow, and much of our infrastructure was set up not to allow that space,” Malarich said. “Frequently in these high-need areas you’ll only have a four-foot-wide parkway, where you can only plant a small tree. Or there are overhead power lines.” I asked, given these realities, how the city could realistically expect to equalize tree coverage across the city. It would be complex, and hard, and would involve short- and long-term creativity and planning, she said. But that was the deadline the city’s plan set out, “putting our feet to the fire.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/27219930174_0184440111_o_copy/2eabf1d73.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Tree planters making the most of the space available, in Los Angeles (Courtesy of City Plants)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Does it matter outside LA</em>? The scale of Los Angeles makes anything that happens there consequential in its own right. But Rachel O’Leary argued that the partnership model—connecting different parts of the city and state government, and linking job-training and community-justice initiatives to climate sustainability—would be “replicable and scalable in other places.”</p><p>“Trees are a powerful tool of climate resilience,” she said. “This is definitely one of the most powerful actions a resident can take, to take climate change into their own hands. That it is how we view it here in this city. And we would encourage other cities to develop partnerships like these.”</p><p>“We’re not the only city that is dealing with this,” Rachel Malarich said. “If we can figure out this way of dealing with this issue of tree canopy inequity, we will have figured out something for other people to look at and learn from.”</p><p>Is any of this “the” answer, for neighborhood justice, civic engagement, and climate sustainability. Obviously not. But it could well be part of an answer, in this large city and elsewhere.</p><div class="feedflare">

<blockquote cite="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/"><p>Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987.

</blockquote>

<p>Running the App Store is a big enough job by itself. It didn&rsquo;t make sense to keep it under Services, and combining it with Marketing only made sense to the extent that Apple wanted Schiller in charge of it. It will be interesting to see how long he continues in that role and who will be next.</p>

    <p>Dan Primack, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we report in Axios Pro Rata today, Apple has expressed serious
interest in buying TikTok.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s <em>not</em> what Primack reported! Primack reported that sources outside Apple <em>claim</em> Apple expressed interest in TikTok, not that Apple actually has expressed interest. The claim that Apple actually has expressed interest exists only in this tweet. The difference is significant if the sources in question were full of shit, which I think they were.</p>

<p>Doesn’t seem like Axios Pro Rata has web permalinks, but <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata">the post reads as follows</a>, and has already been walked back with a pretty clear statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s because Microsoft isn’t the only party kicking TikTok’s
tires, as Trump also said yesterday.</p>

<p>Multiple sources tell me that Apple has expressed interest, albeit
no sources inside of Apple, and that at least one other strategic
has expressed interest. Yes, it would be an unusual deal for
Apple, given that TikTok is a cross-platform app, and a bigger
political headache than Tim Cook may want (both here and in
China). But if anyone has the cash on hand…</p>

<p><em>[Update: An Apple spokesperson tells Axios that there are no
discussions about buying TikTok and the company isn’t
interested].</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-tiktok-treasury-demand-microsoft-sale-559acca3-45da-40ea-acbe-26aef7c8c0b0.html">Here’s an Axios article published an hour ago</a> with the same content as the newsletter, but with Apple’s blanket denial simply standing next to Primack’s unnamed sources (multiple!) claiming that they are. Either Primack’s sources lied to him and he ran it, or Apple is lying.</p>

<p>“Albeit” is doing a lot of work in the phrase “albeit no sources inside of Apple”. Who would know <em>outside</em> of Apple? TikTok, presumably, and … the Trump administration? Primack couldn’t possibly have taken the word of anyone in the Trump administration at face value, right? So my best guess is that TikTok sources are making this up to drive the asking price higher.</p>

<p>It is extremely conspicuous that Apple flatly denied any interest. They will no-comment almost anything.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987. In this role, which reports to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Schiller will continue to lead the App Store and Apple Events. Greg (Joz) Joswiak, a longtime leader within the Product Marketing organization, will join the executive team as senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I can&#8217;t help but think his oversight of the App Store and the company&#8217;s events won&#8217;t last for long, I think the marketing group is in good hands with Joz. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed his presentation style and he&#8217;s been at the company for two decades.</p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Phil-Schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow_08042020.jpg" alt="Papa Phil" /></p>
<p>Schiller himself has had quite a career with Apple. Again, from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Schiller has helped guide Apple’s products as well as its marketing for 30 years. He most recently led the effort to plan and execute Apple’s first-ever virtual Worldwide Developers Conference. The event, notable both for its innovative software and hardware announcements as well as its creative and much-praised execution, set a new standard for what virtual events can achieve in the era of COVID-19.</p>
<p>  “It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many products I love, with all of these great friends — Steve, Tim, and so many more,” said Schiller. “I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life. I’ll keep working here as long as they will have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.”

    <p>After hearing Donald Trump blather away about how great the United States has done in its battle with COVID-19—based on a completely meaningless statistic—perhaps you&#8217;d like to see how we&#8217;re <em>really</em> doing. Here you go:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857113"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1261px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857113" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_deaths_per_million_august_4_2.gif" alt="" width="1261" height="630"></figure>
<p>We are the seventh worst in the world, behind only Belgium, the UK, Peru, Italy, Sweden, and Chile. At the rate we&#8217;re going, in a few weeks we&#8217;ll probably be the third worst country in the world. And that&#8217;s despite a huge and extremely competent health care system.</p>
<p>There was no good reason for this. Maybe we never had the self-discipline and patience to be Germany (109 deaths per million), but even moderately decent leadership could have cut our number in half and had us trending downward instead of heading back up.</p>
<p>Competence matters.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For space reasons in the chart, only every third country is labeled. I also deleted tiny statelets.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The original chart was too confusing. It now shows every country, not every third. The downside is that the type is teensy.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a major change to its executive team today</a>: Phil Schiller, who first started at Apple in 1987, is transitioning into a limited role with far fewer responsibilities, holding the title Apple Fellow. Schiller will retain oversight of the App Store and Apple Events, and continue reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook, but most of his current responsibilities will shift to Greg (Joz) Joswiak, who takes over the title of senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.</p>
<p id="p3">Here&rsquo;s Schiller on this significant day of transition:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &ldquo;It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many products I love, with all of these great friends &mdash; Steve, Tim, and so many more,&rdquo; said Schiller. &ldquo;I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life. I&rsquo;ll keep working here as long as they will have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Tim Cook remarks:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  &ldquo;Phil has helped make Apple the company it is today and his contributions are broad, vast, and run deep. In this new role he will continue to provide the incredible thought partnership, and guidance that have defined his decades at Apple&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Schiller has been one of the most visible members of Apple&rsquo;s team for a long time, most notably owning primary responsibility for introducing new hardware at Apple keynotes, such as the latest iPhone models each year. His expected absence from future such occasions will mark a stark shift for the company.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/B23B1602-D05B-4744-BE8A-D50AA1B8A904-1596561809760.jpeg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p9">Joswiak, who takes Schiller&rsquo;s former role, is no unfamiliar face himself. He has over two decades of leadership experience within Apple, and in recent years has become a regular presence at Apple events as well. Despite being a major force within the company, however, Joswiak&rsquo;s presence on the executive team represents a new level of leadership for him, and come with major new responsibilities.</p>
<p id="p10">After many years of stability at the highest levels of leadership, time is finally catching up with Apple&rsquo;s executive team. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/jony-ive-to-leave-apple-to-form-new-design-firm-and-sabih-kahn-named-svp-of-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">departed the company</a> last summer, just a few months after Angela Ahrendts <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-retail-chief-angela-ahrendts-leaving-company-replaced-by-deirdre-obrien/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vacated her role as SVP of Retail</a>. While today&rsquo;s news follows a different pattern, since Schiller is remaining with the company despite his reduced role, so much change at the top of the organization feels very new for the modern Apple era.</p>
<p id="p11">As someone who began following Apple closely only about a decade ago, not long before the passing of former presentation chief Steve Jobs, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Schiller product introductions and am really going to miss his presence for many keynotes to come.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple
Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987.
In this role, which reports to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Schiller will
continue to lead the App Store and Apple Events. Greg (Joz)
Joswiak, a longtime leader within the Product Marketing
organization, will join the executive team as senior vice
president of Worldwide Marketing. […]</p>

<p>“It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many
products I love, with all of these great friends — Steve, Tim,
and so many more,” said Schiller. “I first started at Apple when I
was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned
changes in my life. I’ll keep working here as long as they will
have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in
the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal
projects I care deeply about.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schiller hasn’t just been at Apple a long time — he’s held the position atop product marketing for, well, as long as I can remember. Product development, advertising, packaging, messaging, comms, keynotes — you name it, if it was public-facing, Schiller has been in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Best way I can put it is that Schiller is the most Apple-y of all Apple executives.</p>

    <p>Phil Schiller, former senior vice president of worldwide marketing and longtime staple of Apple events, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/">has moved on to become an Apple Fellow</a>, following in the footsteps of other notable Apple personnel including Guy Kawasaki, Bill Atkinson, and Steve Wozniak.</p>
<p>Schiller will continue to maintain a presence at the company, overseeing the App Store and Apple Events, and will still report to Tim Cook in his new capacity. But this seems like a step back from his duties as product marketing chief, a sort of pseudo-retirement.</p>
<p>Succeeding Schiller in his role as product marketing chief is Greg “Joz” Jozwiak, another Apple veteran of more than two decades.</p><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/phil-schiller-is-now-an-apple-fellow-succeeded-by-joz/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly
disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list
of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks,
I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them,
counting down to number one.</p>

<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these
are my favorite Macs — a bunch of them I only knew in passing and
never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever — a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious
exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise
we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>

<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a
list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the
last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular,
revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I
have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/">Baseball 100
project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series
will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable
omissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was not just happy but downright delighted to speak with Jason about a few of these Macs. And, yes, I’m outraged over at least one omission.</p>

    <p>Jason Snell on today’s 27-inch iMac update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for the future, is this the last Intel Mac we’ll see? There’s
no way to tell, though reading between the lines, it wouldn’t be
surprising if there were some more Intel-based Mac releases as
Apple progresses through its two-year-long processor transition.
But I’d wager good money that the next time we see an iMac update,
there won’t be an Intel processor at its heart. And perhaps it
will look appreciably different, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a good bet to me that today’s update is the last round of Intel-based iMacs. What else might get an Intel speed bump before Apple Silicon-based Macs start debuting at the end of the year? Maybe the Mac Mini? Speed bumps for the Mac Pro and iMac Pro?</p>

    <p>Isabel Kershner and Pam Belluck, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Confident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a
devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire
student body back in late May.</p>

<p>Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school,
which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single
school in Israel, possibly the world. The virus rippled out to the
students’ homes and then to other schools and neighborhoods,
ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives.
Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close. Across the
country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were
quarantined.</p>

<p>Israel’s advice for other countries?</p>

<p>“They definitely should not do what we have done,” said Eli
Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and
chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council
on the pandemic. “It was a major failure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s Israel’s experience reopening schools <em>after</em> getting infections under control. Here in the U.S. COVID new infections <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">remain out of control <em>already</em></a>, with nearly all schools closed for summer.</p>

    <p>We all know that Donald Trump is an idiot, so I&#8217;ve mostly stopped highlighting the idiocy-of-the-day from the White House. By now, you&#8217;re either convinced or you aren&#8217;t. But every once in a while Trump turns in a performance so jaw dropping that I just have to pass it along. Here is Trump talking about COVID-19 deaths with <em>Axios</em> reporter Jonathan Swan:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">

</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As always, the question is: Is Trump really so deluded that believes this, or is he just willing to say anything to muddy the waters? Or both? It&#8217;s stunning either way.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far
the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel
processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity,
next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with
four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option
for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD
camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A summary of what’s new:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Intel CPUs and AMD graphic cards</li>
<li>SSDs across the line, including options for 4 TB and 8 TB</li>
<li>TrueTone</li>
<li>Nano-texture display finish, like the Pro Display XDR ($500)</li>
<li>RAM options up to 128 GB (base configuration is still 8 GB; the high-end 64 and 128 GB options cost $1,000 and $2,600, respectively)</li>
<li>1080p FaceTime camera with better low-light performance, and a “studio quality” microphone array like the current MacBook Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>The 21-inch iMac has not been updated, although the base model configurations now have SSDs instead of Fusion Drives. There remains a 1 TB Fusion Drive build-to-order configuration for the 21-inch iMac, which I believe is now the last spinning hard disk Apple sells.</p>

<p>The iMac Pro has not been updated either, although the $5,000 base model is now the 10-core Xeon W configuration, and the old 8-core base model is gone.</p>

<p id="p2">Today, Apple revealed an update to the 27-inch 5K Retina iMac with faster processors, updated graphics, more storage, and new display features. Although the new 27-inch iMac&rsquo;s design is identical to the existing model, this is still a significant update compared to the iMac it replaces.</p>
<p id="p3">According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &ldquo;Now more than ever, our customers are relying on the Mac. And many of them need the most powerful and capable iMac we&rsquo;ve ever made,&rdquo; said Tom Boger, Apple&rsquo;s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing. &ldquo;With blazing performance, double the memory, SSDs across the line with quadruple the storage, an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a better camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics, the 27-inch iMac is loaded with new features at the same price. It&rsquo;s the ultimate desktop, to work, create, and communicate.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Last updated in March 2019, the new iMac features 6 and 8-core 10th generation Intel CPUs that can reach speeds of up to 5.0GHz with Turbo Boost. Storage is all SSD now with transfer speeds up to 3.4GB/s when launching apps and large files. There&rsquo;s also an 8TB SSD option for the first time, which is four times the storage available in the previous model. Until today, the standard configurations of the 27-inch iMac came with Fusion drives.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/imac.jpg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p7">The new iMac has been upgraded to AMD Radeon Pro Series 5000 graphics. The display of the iMac is the same resolution as before, but now, it comes with a new nano-texture option first seen in the Pro Display XDR, which provides a low-reflection, matte finish, and it supports Apple&rsquo;s True Tone technology. The new all-in-one desktop also includes a T2 chip for boot and data security, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, and improved speakers and microphones.</p>
<p id="p8">Apple&rsquo;s other iMacs received smaller updates today too. SSDs are now standard in the 21.5-inch model, although a Fusion Drive is still an option. Also, a 10-core Intel Xeon processor is now standard in the iMac Pro.</p>
<p id="p9">Today&rsquo;s updates are in line with Apple&rsquo;s statements during WWDC that the company had additional updates to Macs based on Intel CPUs in the pipeline. Although Macs with ARM processors are on the way later this year, Apple has not revealed which models will be converted to ARM first. Consequently, if you need a new desktop Mac, it&rsquo;s still worth considering the Intel-based models, especially the new 27-inch iMac, which is substantially improved over its last iteration.</p>

<p>The only thing more predictable than members of Congress using hearings to make statements instead of ask questions, and when they do ask questions, usually of the &#8220;gotcha&#8221; variety, refusing to allow witnesses to answer (even as those witnesses seek to run out the clock), is people watching said hearings and griping about how worthless the whole exercise is.</p>
<p>There was, needless to say, all of the above last Wednesday, when the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held a hearing featuring Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. Statements were made, gotcha questions were asked, answers were interrupted, clocks were run out, and there was a whole lot of griping about what a waste of time it all was.</p>
<p>To be sure, it does seem like there must be a better way to hold these hearings, particularly if the goal is to learn something new, but the reality is that genuine inquiry is much more likely to happen without the glare of the media spotlight that inevitably accompanies such a high profile hearing; what that glare will highlight is the politics of the topic in question: what do various politicians and parties actually care about, what do they think that their constituents care about, and how should those affected by said hearings respond.</p>
<p>In that regard last Wednesday&#8217;s hearing was a success: partisan priorities were made clear on the politician side, tech&#8217;s collective position and impact on society came into view, even as each of the companies at the hearing revealed different strengths and vulnerabilities. This article will examine all of these points, but first a caveat: this post, even more than most on Stratechery, is meant as an analysis of the politics of this hearing in particular, not a statement of values; unless I say so explicitly, I am not necessarily endorsing or condemning any particular line of argument, simply pointing it out.</p>
<h4>The Political Effects of Monopoly</h4>
<p>Lina Khan, who rose to prominence with her 2017 law review article <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox</a>, and who served as counsel for the antitrust subcommittee over the course of the investigation that culminated in Wednesday&#8217;s hearings, summarized the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeclap/article/9/3/131/4915966">New Brandeis Movement</a> of antitrust in 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As the name suggests, this new movement traces its intellectual roots to Justice Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court between 1916 and 1939. Brandeis was a strong proponent of America’s Madisonian traditions—which aim at a democratic distribution of power and opportunity in the political economy. Early in the twentieth century, Brandeis successfully updated America’s antimonopoly regime, along Madisonian lines, for the industrial era, and his philosophy held sway well into the 1970s. As the ‘New Brandeis School&#8217; gains prominence — even prompting two floor speeches by Senator Orrin Hatch (a Republican from Utah) — it’s worth understanding what this vision of antimonopoly does and does not represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the article is worth reading in full, it is no accident that Khan started with &#8220;democracy&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Brandeis and many of his contemporaries feared that concentration of economic power aids the concentration of political power, and that such private power can itself undermine and overwhelm public government. Dominant corporations wield outsized influence over political processes and outcomes, be it through lobbying, financing elections, staffing government, funding research, or establishing systemic importance that they can leverage. They use these strategies to win favorable policies, further entrenching their dominance.</p>
<p>  Brandeis also believed that the structure of our markets and of our economy can determine how much real liberty individuals experiences in their daily lives. Most people’s day-to-day experience of power comes not from interacting with public officials, but through relationships in their economic lives — negotiating pay with an employer, for example, or wrangling the terms of business with a trading partner. Brandeis feared that autocratic structures in the commercial sphere — such as when one or a few private corporations call all the shots — can preclude the experience of liberty, threatening democracy in our civic sphere.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman David Cicilline, in the conclusion to his opening statement, made a clear gesture to the New Brandeis Movement:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_0_5163" id="identifier_0_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That is Khan sitting behind Cicilline">1</a></p>

<p>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&#038;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was notable to me is that in the hearing Cicilline and the other Democrats never really focused on this point; the rest of Cicilline&#8217;s opening statement, and much of the Democratic questioning, focused on what they perceived as illegal activities that caused economic harm, without necessarily tying that to political harm. Again, that&#8217;s not to say they were ignoring the linkage, but it wasn&#8217;t a priority.</p>
<p>What made this stand out was that Republicans were focused almost entirely on the politics of monopoly, specifically their contention that large platforms, particularly Google and Facebook (and Twitter), were censoring conservative viewpoints and working to elect Democratic candidates to office, particularly the presidency, and that this was a problem because of their dominance. Leave aside, if you can, your opinion about the veracity of these complaints (and remember my note at the beginning about focusing on analysis): while the Republicans were certainly not endorsing the &#8220;New Brandeis School&#8221; — Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner in particular took care to highlight support for the consumer welfare standard, also known as the &#8220;Chicago School&#8221; — their concern with the size of tech companies had nothing to do with economic effects and everything to do with political effects. It was a striking contrast.</p>
<h4>Begging the Question</h4>
<p>One of the more humorous lines of questioning, at least for language nerds, came courtesy of Republican Representative Matt Gaetz:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div id="v-OX8l0Ypj-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-OX8l0Ypj-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div></video></div></div>
<p>I want to talk about Search because that’s an area where I know Google has real market dominance. On December 11th, you testified to the Judiciary Committee, and in response to a question from my colleague Zoe Lofgren about Search, you said, “We don’t manually intervene on any particular search result.” But leaked memos obtained by The Daily Caller show that that isn’t true. In fact, those memos were altered December 3rd, just a week before your testimony. And they describe a deceptive news blacklist and a process for developing that blacklist approved by Ben Gomes, who leads Search with your company. And also something called a fringe ranking, which seems to beg the question, who gets to decide what’s fringe?</p>
<p>And in your answer, you said to Ms. Lofgren that there is no manual intervention of search. That was your testimony, but … And now I’m going to cite specifically from this memo from The Daily Caller. It says that the … I’m sorry, that The Daily Caller obtained from your company. It says, “The beginning of the workflow starts when a website is placed on a watch list.” It continues, “This watch list is maintained and stored by Ares with access restricted to policy and enforcement specialists.” Sort of does beg the question who these enforcement specialists are?</p></blockquote>
<p>First off, note that this is an example of Republicans linking dominance to concerns about censorship. The point about language, though, is that Gaetz is using the phrase &#8220;begs the question&#8221; incorrectly; I know this, because I used to make the same mistake, until a reader graciously corrected me a couple of years ago. What Gaetz meant to say was &#8220;raises the question&#8221;; &#8220;begs the question&#8221;, on the other hand, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">Wikipedia&#8217;s definition</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  An informal fallacy that occurs when an argument&#8217;s premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of circular reasoning: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy&#8217;s presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For an example of this logical fallacy at work, look no further than this antitrust hearing, and Cicilline&#8217;s concluding statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div id="v-U2zVQGLL-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-U2zVQGLL-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div></video></div></div>
<p>Today, we had the opportunity to hear from the decision makers at four of the most powerful companies in the world. This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies, as exist today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I may nitpick, this is obviously not true — Cicilline had decided well before this hearing that these companies have monopoly power. The problem is that a huge number of questions in the hearing took it as a given that these companies were monopolies, and proceeded to find rather common business practices as being major crimes. In other words, they begged the question.</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples of this fallacy — where it is assumed that a company is a monopoly, and therefore its actions are illegal, and because its actions are illegal it is a monopoly — was this exchange between Representative Jamie Raskin and Bezos:</p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-jhRfu787-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-jhRfu787-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div></video></div></div>
<p>Start with the HBO Max-on-Fire TV question. One of the first things you learn about conducting effective negotiations is that you want to negotiate about more things, not fewer. The reasoning is straightforward: if you are only negotiating about a single variable — in this example, Raskin believes that Amazon and HBO should <em>only</em> negotiate on price — the outcome is zero sum: every cent that Amazon wins is a cent that HBO loses. However, if you are able to introduce more variables, then you might find out that one company cares a lot about price, while the other company cares a lot about promotion (just to make up an example); in that case one company can get a better price and give up a lot of promotional opportunities, while the other can get a worse price and gain a lot of promotional opportunities, and thanks to their differing priorities, both feel like winners. That&#8217;s good negotiating!</p>
<p>It also appears to be, at least according to Raskin, illegal, because Amazon is &#8220;us[ing its] gatekeeper status role in the streaming device market to promote [its] position as a competitor in the video streaming market with respect to content.&#8221; That&#8217;s the problem though: there was zero evidence provided that Amazon has a monopolistic position in either streaming devices or video streaming; it was simply taken as fact, which made basic negotiating practices suspect, and evidence that Amazon was a monopoly. Begging the question.</p>
<p>Raskin&#8217;s question about Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Ring was an even better example of the fallacy at work; while I don&#8217;t really understand why multivariate negotiations would be illegal even if you are a monopoly, there are clear antitrust issues raised by a monopolist acquiring a company for market share. Crucially, though, acquiring a company for market share if you are <em>not</em> a monopolist is not a crime.</p>
<p>It follows, then, that if Amazon had a monopoly in the home automation market, and acquired Ring for market share reasons, that could very well be an antitrust violation, but if they weren&#8217;t a monopoly, it would not be. What is critical to note is that you have to establish that Amazon has a monopoly <em>first</em>; only then can you decide if the acquisition was anticompetitive. Raskin, though, begs the question: the fact that Amazon acquired Ring for market share reasons is taken as evidence that Amazon has a monopoly, which then makes the acquisition illegal.</p>
<p>The same problem applied to Raskin&#8217;s final two complaints: Alexa defaulting to Amazon Prime Music, and recommending Amazon Basics. Those may be a problem if you first establish that Amazon has a monopoly in the relevant product areas, but it is not itself evidence that Amazon is a monopoly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m focusing on this specific exchange, but the truth is that a combination of vilifying common business practices and <em>begging the question</em> was a consistent theme. Things like market research or copying competitor features or improving products were held up as obvious crimes and evidence of monopoly, when they were often not crimes at all, or only crimes if a monopoly in the relevant market had first been established. That is not to say that the committee&#8217;s investigation didn&#8217;t produce evidence of illegal anticompetitive actions, but rather that said evidence, such that there was, too often begged the question.</p>
<h4>The GOP Bargain</h4>
<p>The combination of the Republicans&#8217; focus on the political aspects of antitrust and the tendency of the Democrats to see antitrust crimes even in normal business proceedings produced what was, I think, the most obvious political takeaway for tech companies: the Democrats have made up their minds (and tech is guilty), while the Republicans are willing to cut a deal.</p>
<p>The outline of that deal could not have been more obvious: Republicans are fine with the consumer welfare standard (which, as I noted back in 2016, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/">inherently favors Aggregators</a>) and tech&#8217;s business practices, as long as tech companies don&#8217;t &#8220;censor&#8221;; the alternating format of Congressional hearings placed these demands in direct contrast to Democratic assumptions of guilt. To put it in explicit terms: &#8220;We, Republicans, are your friends in Washington, but if you want us to defend you from the Democrats, you need to stop censoring conservatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&#8217;t matter that conservative websites tend to do particularly well on social media, or that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">the destruction of the media business model helped lay the groundwork for President Trump&#8217;s rise</a>; Republicans expect that tech companies — by which they mostly mean Google and Facebook (and Twitter) — err on the side of not censoring or checking conservative content if they want help in Washington, because that help is not coming from the Democrats.</p>
<h4>Tech&#8217;s United Front</h4>
<p>Something that stood out from the four CEOs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/28/tech-ceo-antitrust-hearing-opening-statement-385233">opening statements</a>, and the general tenor of their defenses, was their insistence that they supported small-and-medium sized businesses.</p>

<p>20 years ago, we made the decision to invite other sellers to sell in our store, to share the same valuable real estate we’ve spent billions to build, market, and maintain. We believe that combining the strengths of Amazon Store with the vast selection of products offered by third parties would be a better experience for customers, and that the growing pie of revenue and profits would be big enough for all. We were betting that it was not a zero sum game. Fortunately, we were right. There are now, 1.7 million small-and-medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.</p></blockquote>

<p>One way we contribute is by building helpful products. Research found that free services like search, Gmail, maps, and photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. And many are small businesses using our digital tools to grow. Stone Dimensions, a family owned stone company in Pewaukee, Wisconsin uses Google My Business to draw more customers. Gil’s appliances, a family owned appliance store in Bristol, Rhode Island credits Google analytics with helping them reach customers online during the pandemic. Nearly one third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.</p></blockquote>

<p>What does motivate us is that timeless drive to build new things that we’re proud to show our users. We focus relentlessly on those innovations, on deepening core principles like privacy and security and on creating new features. In 2008, we introduced a new feature of the iPhone called the App Store launched with 500 apps, which seemed like a lot at the time, the App Store provided a safe and trusted way for users to get more out of their phone. We knew the distribution options for software developers at the time didn’t work well, brick-and-mortar stores charged high fees and have limited reach, physical media like CDs had to be shipped and were hard to update. From the beginning, the App Store was a revolutionary alternative. App Store developers set prices for their apps and never pay for shelf space.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_1_5163" id="identifier_1_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, Cook is pretending like the Internet never existed as a distribution channel">2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This shared focus was notable for two reasons, one specific to these hearings, and one that tells a broader story about how the Internet is changing the world.</p>
<p>First off, probably the most obvious connective thread in the hearing was concern about these companies creating platforms and then favoring themselves unfairly. Amazon, for example, is accused of using data about third party sellers to inform its private-label goods strategy (and data from AWS); Google is accused of using data about search to keep users on its pages; Apple is accused of using its control of the App Store to favor its own apps; and Facebook is accused of using data about app usage to drive its acquisition strategy. What each of these companies is arguing is that focusing on a couple of disgruntled companies is to miss the larger picture, wherein these companies created those opportunities in the first place, and for exponentially more companies than those the Committee may have heard from.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting, though, is that to the extent these companies are right it foretells both a new kind of economy and a new kind of political alignment. Zuckerberg&#8217;s summary was the shortest yet most explicit, perhaps because Facebook is the best example of this phenomenon; I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/">Apple and Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Internet is best illustrated by <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/">the smiling curve</a>, in which value flows to large Aggregators and Platforms on one side, and small businesses built with Internet assumptions about addressable markets (and Internet cost structures) on the other side, while the folks in the middle that built their businesses on owning distribution in a world of scarcity are increasingly obsolete.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That is why you regularly see strange political bedfellows, like Uber and drivers and riders versus taxi companies and politicians, or Airbnb and hosts versus hotels and, well, politicians, or these companies and their small business bases against newspapers, retailers, cross-platform software businesses, vertical aggregators and yes, politicians. Zuckerberg made this point on behalf of the tech industry as a whole:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We’re here to talk about online platforms, but I think the true nature of competition is much broader. When Google bought YouTube, they could compete against the dominant player in video, which was the cable industry. When Amazon bought Whole Foods, they could compete against Kroger’s and Walmart. When Facebook bought WhatsApp, we could compete against telcos who used to charge 10 cents a text message, but not anymore. Now people can watch video, get groceries delivered, and send private messages for free. That’s competition. New companies are created all the time, all over the world. And history shows that if we don’t keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies that used to be big, at least before the big tech companies came along, have the most to lose from tech, but just because they are ill-equipped to compete does not mean they are representative of all businesses, particularly companies that only exist because these platforms and Aggregators exist.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_2_5163" id="identifier_2_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again, this is not to say that regulation isn&rsquo;t necessary &mdash; see A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet ">3</a></p>
<h4>Tech&#8217;s Differing Prospects</h4>
<p>That noted, just because there were similarities in their messaging does not mean that each tech company has similar prospects as far as potential regulation is concerned. From the companies that should be the least concerned to the most:</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> It was obvious that the committee only invited Apple because they wanted to say that they invited all of the large consumer tech CEOs. The questions for Cook were hilariously uninformed about the App Store, making it easy for Apple&#8217;s CEO to run out the clock (often without any interruption). This was certainly disappointing given that many of Apple&#8217;s policies are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">clearly anticompetitive</a> (which, as I noted above, is different than being illegal), but for now the takeaway is that Congress doesn&#8217;t know and doesn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook was probably the biggest beneficiary of Democrats <em>not</em> focusing on political harm relative to economic harm; as I noted last year in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">Tech and Antitrust</a>, there really isn&#8217;t much about the company&#8217;s business practices (post acquisitions) that are anticompetitive. There was an interesting back-and-forth about Facebook&#8217;s discriminatory willingness to deal as far as access to their friend graph is concerned, but for that to be illegal you have to first establish that Facebook is a monopoly.</p>
<p>On this point I thought the Committee&#8217;s questioning was frequently unfair: the fact that social networks that existed when Facebook was founded no longer do (MySpace, Friendster, etc.) was taken as evidence that Facebook is a monopoly, with zero acknowledgment of the rise of Snapchat, TikTok, iMessage, etc. Similarly, Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Instagram was discussed as if it happened today, when Instagram has over a billion users, as opposed to 2012, when it had 30 million. To be sure, <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/189433922243919872">some</a> saw the anticompetitive angle of that purchase at the time, but many more mocked the price; at a minimum we can all agree that judging decisions made in 2012 according to the facts of 2020 isn&#8217;t necessarily just.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon seemed to attract the most in-depth scrutiny from the committee (perhaps because of Kahn), and while the biggest focus was on the 3rd-party marketplace and Amazon&#8217;s private-label strategy, there was a clear attempt across multiple questioners to make the case that Amazon creates &#8220;innovation kill zones&#8221;, as Representative Joe Neguse put it, across all of its product lines. There was clearly a target on Bezos.</p>
<p>At the same time, as Bezos regularly noted, it is not clear in what markets Amazon has a monopoly, and if it is not a monopoly, a lot of the behavior lawmakers were objecting to is not illegal (and, as I noted above, may not be illegal regardless). Bezos also made the point that only the military has a higher approval rating than Amazon, and when it comes to politics, that still matters.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> I think that Google is in trouble. The company received the second greatest amount of specificity in its questions as far as competition topics go — Representative Pramila Jayapal&#8217;s questions about ad exchanges was particularly well-done, especially given the constraints of the format — but more importantly, at least far as the politics of this hearing is concerned, was revealed to have no friends.</p>
<p>Specifically, the price of the company pulling out of Project Maven and the Pentagon&#8217;s JEDI project because of concerns about collaborating with the U.S. military<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_3_5163" id="identifier_3_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally, I think the real reason that Google pulled out of the JEDI project is that Google Cloud was not competitive with Azure and AWS; citing ethical concerns was a misguided attempt to claim a strategy credit that is coming back to bite the company in a major way">4</a> is that the GOP deal I detailed above is not on the table: Republicans pushed Pichai on not just censorship and election interference but also its refusal to support the military repeatedly, and it seems clear than if and when an antitrust case is brought against the company, it will have few defenders. That is a particularly big problem for Google because <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">the antitrust case against the company is by far the most straightforward</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">last week before the hearing</a>, I am glad that it occurred. Figuring out how to regulate tech companies — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">particularly Aggregators</a>, that base their power on consumer welfare — will require new approaches, and probably new laws. Moreover, any such regulations will necessitate difficult trade-offs between competition, privacy, national security, etc. (I was grateful that Representative Kelly Armstrong highlighted how GDPR made big tech companies stronger), which again means that Congress is best situated to decide what tradeoffs we should make.</p>
<p>To that end, I think the hearing was more successful than the format made it seem: there is more clarity about both Democratic and Republican priorities, as well as potential new divisions driven by technology generally, and a finer-grained understanding of how individual companies raise different concerns specifically. No, this wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&#8221;, but then again that movie was made by a studio about to be convicted of acting anti-competitively.</p>

    <p>Today, Apple has updated the iMac. While the design remains the same, it&#8217;s a meaningful update here in the twilight of the Intel era.</p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-magickeyboardnum-magicmouse2-macos-wallpaper_08042020_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="iMac with 5K Retina display" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/">Here&#8217;s Apple:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Now more than ever, our customers are relying on the Mac. And many of them need the most powerful and capable iMac we’ve ever made,” said Tom Boger, Apple’s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing. “With blazing performance, double the memory, SSDs across the line with quadruple the storage, an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a better camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics, the 27-inch iMac is loaded with new features at the same price. It’s the ultimate desktop, to work, create, and communicate.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the case is the same, Apple has brought the Pro Display XDR&#8217;s nano-texture option to the iMac for the first time. Like on the XDR, it will set you back a pretty penny: $500 to be exact.</p>
<p>In more reasonable news, the iMac now supports TrueTone. Above the display is a 1080p webcam, an upgrade from the previous models.</p>
<p>On the spec end of things, the 27-inch iMac now uses 10th-gen Intel CPUs across the board, and includes faster AMD GPUs, providing twice the video memory as in previous models.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the new machine can be ordered with 10 Gigabit Ethernet and up to 128 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>If it sounds like the iMac is creeping up toward the iMac Pro, it&#8217;s because it is. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/last-hurrah-imacs-get-intel-processor-upgrade-all-ssd-storage-t2-chip/">Here&#8217;s a bit from Jason Snell&#8217;s report:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Last year’s iMacs already pushed up against the performance of the iMac Pro, and these will undoubtedly beat it—especially that 10-core model. In an acknowledgement of this, Apple has rejiggered the iMac Pro line, dropping the old base eight-core model and moving the 10-core model to the base price. So now the iMac line ends at 10 cores and the iMac Pro line begins there.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the storage front, Apple was quick to note the inclusion of SSDs in all standard configurations of the 5K iMac, and that&#8217;s true, but the base models come with a measly 256 GB of storage.<sup id="fnref-19958-fn-t2"><a href="http://512pixels.net#fn-19958-fn-t2" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> This may be a roadblock for some users, so the Fusion Drive is still an option on the 21.5-inch models.</p>
<p>Speaking of that other iMac, it didn&#8217;t get much love today past the storage story.</p>
<p>The 21.5-inch iMac is still using older 7th- and 8th-gen Intel processors, but every base model comes equipped with SSDs. That&#8217;s about it in terms of updates for the smaller of the two models. The $1,099 model even still comes with a 1920&#215;1080 display.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn-19958-fn-t2">
This also means Apple&#8217;s T2 security chip is present on the new iMacs, a first for the line. And just because I couldn&#8217;t find a good place for it, the new iMacs include a fancy new microphone system, but still come with the previous set of speakers, which were already pretty dang good.&#160;<a href="http://512pixels.net#fnref-19958-fn-t2">&#8617;</a>

    <figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac2020.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="iMac" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At Apple’s developer conference in June, Tim Cook said that the company still had Macs with Intel processors in its pipeline. It must be rapidly filling with Macs with Apple silicon, but on Tuesday that pipeline <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/">disgorged a new Intel-based 27-inch iMac</a> with a bunch of technical improvements, while retaining the prices of previous models.</p>
<p>For those expecting a redesign to the exterior of the iMac, which has been largely unchanged for many years now, it’s clear that any major rethinking of Apple’s venerable all-in-one is going to have to wait for the Apple silicon era. Apple’s not doing what it did with the iMac back during the last processor transition and redesigning the exterior just <em>before</em> swapping chips, and future Mac historians will be thankful for that.</p>
<p><span id="more-12574"></span></p>
<p>The biggest external change to the iMac this time around is an optional one: You can order one with the same glare-killing “nanotexture” glass texture as on Apple’s Pro Display XDR, for an additional $500. If you live in a very bright environment and the glare is making you sad, this upgrade might be worth it. Regardless of which texture, though, the iMac display also now supports TrueTone.</p>
<p>Moving to the inside, the iMac has gotten a lot of big improvements over <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/04/2019-imac-review/">the versions that it released in March 2019</a>. The new 27-inch iMac is powered by 10th-generation Intel processors, and for the first time, there’s a 10-core i9 option. Graphics are powered by 7nm AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs, including a configure-to-order version with 16GB of VRAM for the first time on the 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>(Last year’s iMacs already pushed up against the performance of the iMac Pro, and these will undoubtedly beat it—especially that 10-core model. In an acknowledgement of this, Apple has rejiggered the iMac Pro line, dropping the old base eight-core model and moving the 10-core model to the base price. So now the iMac line ends at 10 cores and the iMac Pro line begins there.)</p>
<p>But this is more than just a processor bump, because Apple made a bunch of upgrades to other aspects of the iMac subsystem. The biggest news is that SSD storage is now standard across the entire iMac line (with options up to 8TB), where previously Apple made Fusion Drive (which is a small SSD coupled with a spinning hard drive) the standard. This is a long-overdue move, but I’m glad that Apple has finally made it. All iMac users deserve the speed of SSD storage.</p>
<p>However, there are a few wrinkles: The base storage level starts at 256GB, which is not a lot of storage. It might be plenty for some use cases, but other users will run into that limitation awfully quickly, especially if they’re storing a bunch of family photos locally in a Photos library. That’s why Apple is still offering a 1TB Fusion Drive as a configurable option on the 21.5-inch model, for no added cost. So while we can’t definitively say that the spinning hard drive has finally been pushed out of all Mac hardware, it’s gone from all the default configurations, at least.</p>
<p>Memory capacity has been doubled on the 27-inch iMac, so it now supports up to 128GB of DRAM. And the iMac has become the last Mac to receive a T2 security chip, which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2018/01/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution/">enables all sorts of features</a> previously unavailable on the iMac. That includes automatic disk encryption and security features, yes. But it also means improved image quality from the iMac’s camera, which has been upgraded to 1080p resolution. The T2 also provides improved audio processing, which should improve the sound of the (otherwise unchanged) iMac speakers.</p>
<p>As it did last year <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/macbook-pro-16/">with the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, Apple has upgraded the microphone system on the 27-inch iMac. There are two microphones on the iMac’s chin, and another on the back, and they work together to cancel out echo and noise and create what Apple calls a “studio quality” experience. My experience with the MacBook Pro’s microphone system was positive, but with caveats depending on how you positioned the laptop. I would imagine that the iMac, as a much more stationary device, will generate a more consistent sound—and the people on the other end of teleconferences will appreciate the added clarity.</p>
<p>The new iMac is available to order as of now and will ship later this week.</p>
<p>As for the future, is this the last Intel Mac we’ll see? There’s no way to tell, though reading between the lines, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were some more Intel-based Mac releases as Apple progresses through its two-year-long processor transition. But I’d wager good money that the next time we see an iMac update, there won’t be an Intel processor at its heart. And perhaps it will look appreciably different, too.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, here’s a fast new Intel iMac with upgraded internals and no more spinning-disk storage. It’s not the <em>giant</em> step forward that seems inevitable—but it’s a step forward all the same.</p>

    <p class="">I have been thinking about how the coronavirus pandemic has changed my life. There are lots of big and small ways. Have you thought about how the pandemic has changed time for you?<br><br>There were things you used to spend your time on, but where are you now saving time? That long commute is on hiatus. The drop-in visitors to your office to “shoot the breeze” is much less likely. If you think about it, there are lots of ways you may be saving time now that you weren’t before.<br><br>On the flip side, what are the new time sucks in your life? These days “Zoom Meeting” is becoming just as dirty of a phrase as “Powerpoint Presentation” was before all this madness started.&nbsp;<br><br>Everyone has their own accounting of time gained and time lost over the past several months, but if you’re not aware of your own, you should be. A half-hour commute to work equates to five found hours per week, 20 hours per month, 240 hours over a year. That’s six weeks in your pocket. You could do a lot with that time. The question is whether you will recognize you have it and what you will do with it.</p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/peeler.jpg" /></p><p>As a kid, it was my job to peel mountains of potatoes to feed our large family. I hated it. The potato peelers were all dull and some were rusty. They were wobbly and more likely to peel a finger than a potato.</p>
<p>These days I kind of enjoy peeling potatoes, thanks to my <a href="https://geni.us/kuhn-rikon">Kuhn Rikon Original Swiss Peeler</a>. This peeler will save you a lot of time and skinned fingers.</p>
<p>The super-sharp carbon steel blade is capable of peeling pretty much any vegetable or fruit, even tough-skinned customers like butternut squash. It peels smoothly and evenly, taking off just the right amount of skin so you lose a minimal amount of the inner flesh of the vegetable or fruit. I’ve had the peeler for about nine months and it’s still as sharp as it was when I bought it.</p>
<p>As a left-handed person, I appreciate that this peeler can be used in either hand. It also has a convenient potato eye remover.</p>
<p>I love this potato peeler so much I bought a 3-pack for my mom for Christmas. Cheap gift? Maybe. But at least now I won’t have to use her rusty, dull peelers when I visit.</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s look at the continued fraction representation for √14.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/continued_fraction_sqrt_14.png" alt="\sqrt{14} = 3 + \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{2+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{6+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{2+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{6+ \ddots}}}}}}}}" width="372" height="239" /></p>
<p>If we were to take more terms, the sequence of denominators would repeat:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, …</p>
<p>We could confirm this with Mathematica:</p>

<p>For any integer <em>d</em> that is not a perfect square, the continued fraction for √<em>d</em> has a pattern that we see above.</p>

<li>The coefficients after the first one are periodic.</li>
<li>The cycle consists of a <abbr title="A sequence that remains the same when reversed">palindrome</abbr> followed by a single number.</li>
<li>The last number in the cycle is twice the leading coefficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the example above, the periodic part is {1, 2, 1, 6}. The palindrome is {1, 2, 1} and 6 is twice the initial coefficient 3.</p>
<p>Another way to state the third point above is to say that the leading coefficient is the integer part of the square root of <em>d</em>, i.e. ⌊√<em>d</em>⌋, and the last coefficient in each period is 2⌊√<em>d</em>⌋.</p>

<p>Sometimes the palindrome is empty:</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[5], 10]
    Out: {2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4}
</pre>
<p>In the continued fraction for √5 the palindrome part is empty and we repeat 4, twice the initial coefficient.</p>
<p>For √3, the palindrome is simply {1} and the final number is 2.</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[3], 13]
    Out: {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}
</pre>
<p>One last example:</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[71], 17]
    Out: {8, 2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 2, 16, 2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 2, 16}
</pre>

    <p>Liza Lin, Jing Yang, and Eva Xiao, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump’s remark over the weekend that he was weighing an
outright ban of TikTok in the U.S. sparked nationalist sentiments
in China, where the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid,
derided the situation as “the hunting and looting of TikTok by the
U.S. government in conjunction with U.S. high-tech companies.”</p>

<p>On Chinese social media, users likewise expressed outrage. Many on
the Twitter -like Weibo platform accused the Trump administration
of pandering to voters by stemming the rise of TikTok — and by
extension, China.</p>

<p>On Douyin, Bytedance’s domestic analogue to TikTok, where videos
commenting on a possible U.S. ban circulated widely, one popular
comment suggested Huawei be allowed to buy Apple Inc.’s China
operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Be allowed to buy” is some euphemism for a forced sale. But if China decides to retaliate — and why wouldn’t they? — what company might they target other than Apple? Facebook and Google are already banned in China. Amazon has AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">which has a fair-sized presence there</a>, but AWS is sort of the anti-TikTok in terms of being consumer-facing. Microsoft would be the obvious tit-for-tat target. But does Microsoft have a neatly bundled consumer presence in China?</p>

<p>If I were the dictator of China, and I was angry about the Trump administration forcing a proud Chinese company like ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok, and I was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-china-idUSKCN25002I">looking for a way to show that China cannot be pushed around</a> by the U.S., I’d look at iCloud and the App Store, and humiliating the biggest company in the world.</p>

<p>But AAPL shares are trading at an all-time high so I’m sure all is good and Apple has nothing to worry about with a rapidly escalating trade war with China and a cornered-rat deranged narcissist steering the U.S.</p>

    <p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A transaction of the type the president envisions could also prove
more expensive than the one Microsoft described on Sunday. Trump
said Monday that part of the amount paid to buy TikTok would have
to come to the U.S. Treasury Department because it would be making
the deal possible.</p>

<p>“It’s a little bit like the landlord/tenant; without a lease the
tenant has nothing, so they pay what’s called ‘key money,’ or they
pay something,” Trump said. “But the United States should be
reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money,
because without the United States they don’t have anything, at
least having to do with the 30%.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve never heard of “key money”? Me neither, before today. But Trump would know it because it’s a term from crooked New York real estate deals. <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2015/11/what_is_key_money">Here’s a 2015 story on “key money” by Virginia K. Smith for the New York real estate site Brick Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Key money is when you pay a landlord money (usually under the
table) to secure an apartment,” says renters rights attorney Sam
Himmelstein, who notes that sometimes, it was supers, building
managers, or even the tenants themselves who demanded the cash.
The practice, unsurprisingly, is illegal — only licensed real
estate brokers are allowed to collect commission for an apartment — and has largely fallen by the wayside in recent years. “I
haven’t seen it in years,” says Himmelstein, “and most people
don’t report it unless they get into a scrape with their
landlords.”</p>

<p>But why even agree to this kind of bribe in the first place?
Essentially, key money served as a payoff for a lease that held
particular value, like that of a rent-stabilized apartment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s how crooked this piece of shit Trump is — he just uses lingo that’s synonymous with illegal kickbacks <em>with no shame</em>.</p>

    <p>Current Affairs editor Nathan J. Robinson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. It costs
money to produce good writing, to run a website, to license
photographs. A <em>lot</em> of money, if you want quality. Asking people
for a fee to access content is therefore very reasonable. You
don’t expect to get a print subscription to the newspaper
<em>gratis</em>, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble
about having to pay for online content, because I run a magazine
and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.</p>

<p>But let us also notice something: the New York Times, the New
Yorker, the Washington Post, the New Republic, New York, Harper’s,
the New York Review of Books, the Financial Times, and the London
Times all have paywalls. Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Wire, the
Federalist, the Washington Examiner, InfoWars: free! You want
“<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/01/portland-protesters-burn-bibles-american-flags-in-the-streets/">Portland Protesters Burn Bibles, American Flags In The

COVID Restrictions</a>,” or an article <a href="https://www.infowars.com/nih-admits-5g-can-actually-create-coronavirus-within-human-cells/">suggesting the National
Institutes of Health has admitted 5G phones cause coronavirus</a> — they’re yours. You want the detailed Times reports on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/europe/germany-nazi-infiltration.html">neo-Nazis infiltrating German institutions</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html">reasons

administration’s undercutting of the USPS’s effectiveness</a> — well, if you’ve clicked around the website a bit you’ll run
straight into the paywall. This doesn’t mean the paywall shouldn’t
be there. But it does mean that it costs time and money to access
a lot of true and important information, while a lot of bullshit
is completely free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Why not someone like Disney which has dreams of being part of the
digital revolution? Disney has the audience. It has sprawling
global operations. It has the ability to walk the middle of the
road where it can appease the autocratic governments and make the
democratic countries satisfied. It also has a brand that has many
sub-brands that cross many demographic categories. Disney wanted
to buy Twitter. TikTok makes more of a strategic fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Comcast?</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Apple? It has money. It has the desire to blunt Facebook
and Google, even if it hasn’t said or done so explicitly! Or is it
because they are a bunch of hard asses when it comes to privacy
and may not play ball with the US government when it needs to
access data of some TikTok-er?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence my question, why Microsoft?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d be shocked if Apple got involved. Just isn’t their bag. But why is there no bidding war for TikTok? In addition to the baldfaced crookedness of Trump demanding and Microsoft offering a “key money” kickback to the U.S. Treasury, the other crooked angle in this claptrap saga is the fact that an acquisition of TikTok, partial or otherwise, is presented as an offer to Microsoft, not a company up for bid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I ask these questions but can’t help myself and not think about
the event of last week?</p>

<p>Why was Microsoft not part of the showdown between BigTech and
Washington DC? What makes them better than the other four? Why do
they get to be excused from on-air humiliation while others get
spanked for their monopolies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft’s absence from last week’s hearing was conspicuously odd then; <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/3/21353079/trump-tiktok-microsoft-antitrust-big-tech-china">now it’s glaring</a>. Especially when “buying upstart competitors” was one of the main thrusts of the whole thing.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of Apple’s stock, this is welcome news. If you’re a fan of Apple’s products, this is profoundly worrisome. How does a company this large, this successful, <em>not</em> succumb to hubris? How does Apple keep the edge of an upstart? I’m not saying it’s impossible.

<blockquote>
  <p>Just read the thing. It’s almost like a letter of fealty. It
reads like something a Chinese company might write under the
Chinese government. To that end, it reads as if it was written at
the <em>behest</em> of the government. Maybe that’s too strong. <em>Maybe</em>?
How about: “Hey Satya, great conversation today. It sure would be
nice if you could outline what we discussed publicly.” That kind
of thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the
President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject
to a complete security review and providing proper economic
benefits to the United States, including the United States
Treasury.</p>

<p>This is an actual paragraph in the post. The second paragraph, no
less. What on Earth?! Is Treasury getting a finder’s fee here?</p>

<p>I thought Tim Cook’s participation in Ivanka Trump’s “just find something new” Zoom panel <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/15/find-something-new-my-ass">was a bad look</a>. This is something else.</p>

    <p>A new study says that dementia has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/alzheimers-dementia-rates.html">on the wane for multiple decades:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risk for a person to develop dementia over a lifetime is now <strong>13 percent lower than it was in 2010.</strong> Incidence rates at every age have steadily declined over the past quarter-century&#8230;.<strong>In 1995, a 75-year-old man had about a 25 percent chance of developing dementia in his remaining lifetime. Now that man’s chance declined to 18 percent,</strong> said Dr. Albert Hofman, chairman of the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the new paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.osu.edu/baby-boomers-show-concerning-decline-in-cognitive-functioning/">But wait:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a reversal of trends, <strong>American baby boomers scored lower on a test of cognitive functioning than did members of previous generations,</strong> according to a new nationwide study.</p>
<p>Findings showed that average cognition scores of adults aged 50 and older increased from generation to generation, beginning with the greatest generation (born 1890-1923) and peaking among war babies (born 1942-1947). Scores began to decline in the early baby boomers (born 1948-1953) and decreased further in the mid baby boomers (born 1954-1959).<br />
<strong>While the prevalence of dementia has declined recently in the United States, these results suggest those trends may reverse in the coming decades,</strong> according to study author Hui Zheng, professor of sociology at The Ohio State University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust the boomers to screw things up. On the other hand, this might be the result of juvenile lead poisoning, and <em>that&#8217;s</em> the fault of the Greatest Generation. Greatest indeed.</p>

Then each astronaut was instructed to briefly turn on wifi to enable the iPad’s AirDrop feature for wirelessly sending the screenshots between iPads.

<p>He began by emphasizing that while the Cube was powerful, it was air-cooled. (Jobs hated fans. Hated them.) He demonstrated how it didn&rsquo;t have a power switch, but could sense a wave of your hand to turn on the juice. He showed me how Apple had eliminated the tray that held CDs&mdash;with the Cube, you just hovered the disk over the slot and the machine inhaled it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Cube violated the wisdom of his product plan. It didn&rsquo;t have the power features of the high-end Power Mac, like slots or huge storage. And it was way more expensive than the low-end iMac, even before you spent for a necessary separate display required of Cube owners. Knowing I was risking his ire, I asked him: Just who was going to buy this?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But here is something else about Jobs and the Cube that speaks not of failure but why he was a successful leader. Once it was clear that his Cube was a brick, he was quick to cut his losses and move on.</p>

<p>I am the first to wonder whether it makes sense to write yet another part of this little saga, when Catalina is basically entering its last two months of active duty. But Catalina remains, I think, one of the most (if not the most) controversial Mac OS X releases, and now that I have finally had direct experience with it on a new machine I&rsquo;m using just for testing, I can confirm.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>When a couple of articles from this series on Catalina reached Hacker News in the past months, a lot of quips I got as response were from people who dismissed the problem altogether with remarks along the lines of <em>These nerds must always find something to complain/whine about. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Catalina</em>. Well, that&rsquo;s simply not the impression I&rsquo;ve had and continue to have. And not because I have 309 emails of negative feedback and horror stories to prove it, but because this volume of feedback itself is an indicator, in my private sphere, of a larger discussion that has been going on publicly (in online forums and specialised mailing lists) since Catalina was released last autumn.</p>

<p>I was hoping to skip directly to Big Sur, but I&rsquo;ll probably have to update to Catalina soon to use the latest Xcode.</p>

    <p>This is the third and last picture of highways fading into the distance from my Arizona trip earlier this year. But this isn&#8217;t really one single highway: it&#8217;s Baker Blvd. in the foreground and Interstate 15 in the distance. If I had backed up a few hundred feet you&#8217;d also be able to see the world&#8217;s largest thermometer, but alas, that would have put me on lower ground and spoiled the shot. All art is a series of compromises.</p>

This tweet was spurred by President Trump&#8217;s latest temporary appointment: Anthony Tata, a retired brigadier general with a history of anti-Islamic tweets. The Senate made clear that Tata was not going to be confirmed as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, so instead Trump simply appointed him as &#8220;the official Performing the Duties of&#8221; the DUDP. He could do this because the Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows him to. Trump has used the Vacancies Act to appoint dozens (hundreds?) of temporary officials without the bother of Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>This is an abuse of the intent of the Vacancies Act, but in the spirit of bipartisan benevolence I&#8217;ll offer up a simple compromise: tighten up the Vacancies Act and at the same time cut way back on the number of executive branch officials who require Senate confirmation. There are about 1,200 of them these days, and that sure seems like overkill. Does every deputy undersecretary really need a full-dress Senate confirmation, after all?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. Let Trump—and other presidents—appoint far more of their team than they do now, but for the positions that really matter get stricter about Senate confirmation. Given the intense partisanship of the Senate these days, this might also require placing some bounds on how long the Senate can keep a position from being filled, but that&#8217;s a subject for another days.</p>

  <p>Speaking at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said that TikTok
would shut down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another company
purchased it. He added that the U.S. Treasury Department would
need to receive a lot of money in return for the deal, without

    <p>Seems like solid value for the price — $350 — but who’s going to buy it? I’m not saying people <em>shouldn’t</em> buy it, I’m saying they won’t because the people who should consider it are unlikely to know it exists. At this price, with this quality, the Pixel 4A seemingly deserves a major marketing campaign that I don’t think it’s going to get.</p>

The canonical versions are PDFs, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/28/tech-ceo-antitrust-hearing-opening-statement-385233">Politico has conveniently transcribed them on a web page</a>.</p>

<p>Cook’s whole statement is cogent, and though Bezos’s is clearly the most personal of the four statements, I think Cook wrote this or at least was very involved in the writing of it. This is how he sounds and thinks. His entire statement is worth reading, but I’ll just quote the portions I have comments on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is a uniquely American company whose success is only
possible in this country. Motivated by the mission to put things
into the world that enrich people’s lives, and believing deeply
that the way we do that is by making the <em>best</em> not the <em>most</em>,
Apple has produced many revolutionary products, not least of which
is the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “making the <em>best</em> not the <em>most</em>” line is true, and captures what made Apple <em>Apple</em>, and what Apple should continue to focus on as its North Star in all of its varying endeavors. The question, now that Apple has parlayed this formula into becoming the largest (by market cap) and most profitable company in the world, is whether Tim Cook truly still leads the company based on this axiom, or if he’s just saying it because “<em>we don’t have a majority market share of any product category, including phones</em>” is a pretty strong starting position for an antitrust hearing. They don’t sell the most things but they do make the most money, so it’s not like “most” doesn’t apply to Apple.</p>

<p>I think the answer is a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B. There’s a part of Cook that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/23/apple-ceo-tim-cook-has-spent-much-of-july-preparing-for-house-antitrust-hearing">clearly wants to argue that Apple shouldn’t even be here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do this, in part, by making ourselves and our customers a
promise — a promise that we will only build things that make us
proud. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs used to put it a little
differently: we only make things that we would recommend to our
family and friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rings fundamentally true but falls flattest in the areas where Apple is, or at least should be, getting the most antitrust scrutiny. Take for example the Netflix Rule — the “reader apps” exception that allows Netflix (to name the most conspicuous example) to offer an iOS app that does not use Apple’s in-app purchase system. To sign up for Netflix, a new customer has to do so at Netflix’s website. A lot of other apps — <a href="https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com/">many from very large companies, like Microsoft and Google</a> — take advantage of the same rule. The way the rule works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only certain categories of apps qualify. Apple calls them “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">reader apps</a>” but most of them don’t involve reading.</p></li>
<li><p>These apps offer paid services, but accept payment only on their own respective websites, not through the apps, cutting Apple out of the financial transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>These iOS apps are free to download, but when launched, are allowed to show only a way to sign <em>in</em>, not sign <em>up</em>. Not only do Apple’s rules forbid these apps from offering sign up within the app (which, in my opinion, is fine), or offering a tappable link to sign up on the web, but the apps are even forbidden from simply explaining in written words what you need to do to sign up. Apps using this rule can’t even say “To create a new account, visit our website” — <em>even if they don’t tell you the URL of the website</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">I wrote about this regarding Netflix in particular last year</a>, noting that Netflix does offer a telephone support number in the app. I called it, and a helpful customer service rep told me that to create a new account I needed to go to Netflix’s website and sign up there. They can’t just print those simple words in the app, but they can set up a phone number where they tell you what to do. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">As I wrote then</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, Apple can make the rules — it’s their platform. But it’s
just wrong that one of the rules is that apps aren’t allowed to
explain the rules to users. Apple should be earning its share of
in-app subscription revenue by competing on convenience, not
confusion and obfuscation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is <em>prima facie</em> wrong that one of the rules is that an app is not allowed to explain the rules.</p>

<p>Is Apple proud of this rule against explaining the rules, and do they enjoy explaining it to their friends and family?</p>

<p>Back to Cook’s opening statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like
Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful
smartphone businesses offering different approaches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google does not have a successful smartphone business, if by smartphone business Cook means selling smartphones. Google certainly derives many benefits from being the company behind Android, the operating system, and the Google Play ecosystem that is effectively a user-facing OS on top of Android, but that’s nothing at all like Samsung, LG, or Huawei.</p>

<p>And Huawei is an odd company to mention in the context of the U.S. market, where their phones and telecom equipment <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk">are banned because of national security concerns</a>. Worldwide, though, yeah, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/299128/global-market-share-held-by-huawei-smartphones/">Huawei sells a lot of phones</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we
do business. That is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any
product category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No M-word, but the meaning is clear: Apple has no monopoly so why are they here? Mind you, I’m not saying <em>I</em> think Apple doesn’t belong here — I think they do — I’m saying that’s what Cook is implying. No monopoly, no antitrust. And it’s undeniably true that antitrust laws, as written, don’t address a company that has attained a dominant position with only minority market share.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We created the App Store in 2008 as a feature of the iPhone.
Launching with a little more than 500 apps, it was our ambitious
attempt to drastically expand the features and customizability of
every user’s device. We wanted to create a safe and trusted place
for users to discover apps — and a means of providing a secure
and supportive way for developers to develop, test and distribute
apps to iPhone users globally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention here of Steve Jobs’s statement, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/app_store_moment_of_clarity">announcing the App Store in 2008</a>: “We don’t intend to make any money off the App Store. We’re basically giving all the money to the developers and the 30 percent that pays for running the store, that’ll be great.”</p>

<p>It would be interesting to ask Cook when Apple’s perspective on that changed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Curation has always been one of the App Store’s chief features and
sources of value for our users. We held a quality department store
as a model: a place where customers can find a great variety of
options, but can feel confident that the selection is
high-quality, reliable and current.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analogy to a “quality department store” holds as much water as a sieve. The App Store is analogous only to something like Amazon, an everything store, with apps ranging from premium products to abject junk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the App Store was created, the prevailing distribution
options available to software developers at the time did not
work well. Brick-and-mortar stores charged high fees and had
limited reach. Physical media like CDs had to be shipped and
were hard to update.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To omit the fact that there was — dating back to the mid-’90s, well over a decade before the iPhone App Store — a thriving market for software sold directly over a thing called “The Internet” is sophistry. Most Mac software is still sold and distributed this way <em>today</em>. If App Stores are so great why is most Mac software sold outside the Mac App Store?</p>

<p>Rob Pegoraro today wrote an entire piece for Forbes on just this point: “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robpegoraro/2020/07/29/what-tim-cook-left-out-of-his-version-of-app-store-history/">What Tim Cook Left Out of His Version of App Store History</a>”. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Brick-and-mortar software stores and middlemen distributors did charge exorbitant fees, and distributing software on physical media, no matter how it was sold, sucked. But talking about brick-and-mortar retail software sales in 2020 is like talking about when cars sucked because you had to crank their motors by hand to start them. Or even like talking about when our city streets were ankle deep in horseshit before cars existed.</p>

<p>Talking about brick-and-mortar software distribution without even mentioning direct downloads and sales over the web is flat-out dishonest, and clearly the most disappointing aspect of Cook’s prepared testimony.<sup id="fnr1-2020-07-29"><a href="#fn1-2020-07-29">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This same point came up in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/the_talk_show_wwdc_2020">my WWDC 2020 interview with Greg Joswiak and Craig Federighi</a>. Joz more or less made the same argument, talking about the App Store being the next step after brick-and-mortar, completely omitting direct web distribution and sales. Which, again, wasn’t just an intermediary step, but a market that thrives to this day. I let that slide without pressing back, and it’s my biggest (only?) regret of that interview. What I recall was being taken aback by the reference to brick-and-mortar — <em>how is that relevant?</em> — and completely missing Joz’s omission of the web as a distribution and sales platform. Trust me, no one regrets this flub more than me — especially now, as Apple continues to make the same specious argument.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-07-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Voting by mail has always been viewed as favorable to Republicans—or at worst a wash. Democrats embraced it this year because it makes sense in the middle of a pandemic, but Donald Trump simply refused to believe that anybody, let alone Democrats, could possibly be acting altruistically. The only thing that made sense to him was that mail voting must be some kind of Democratic trick and therefore he was opposed to it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re so transactional and so cynical that you don&#8217;t believe non-selfish behavior is even possible.

    <p>After Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late ’90s, he famously simplified the company’s product line by drawing a four-product grid: consumer desktop (the bulbous, brightly colored G3 iMac), consumer laptop (then, just an empty space), professional desktop (the Power Mac, first the blue-and-white G3 and then the G4), and professional laptop (the PowerBook).</p>
<p><span id="more-12429"></span></p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There was no consumer laptop in Apple’s product line until the iBook was announced. PowerBooks were <em>expensive</em>. And as for that consumer desktop, the G3 iMac was a wild success<sup id="fnref-12429-imac"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-imac" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>, but for years the <em>real</em> Mac users looked down on it as a weird, underpowered toy that wasn’t suited for getting real work done<sup id="fnref-12429-work"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-work" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context, it’s easy to underestimate just how much importance the professional Mac tower had in the mind of the Mac world back in the day.  As defined by the standards of the 90s and early 2000s, these were <em>real</em> computers—boxes you could open up and swap hard drives, install RAM, stick in expansion cards, maybe even upgrade the processor itself. Time and trends and Apple’s own predilections have led us to a world, two decades later, where the only Mac that fits these criteria starts at $6,000, but back then the desktop tower was <em>the</em> Mac. The one that mattered.<sup id="fnref-12429-garbage"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-garbage" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Apple introduced an entirely new Mac tower, one that traded the cute colorful plastic of the Power Mac G3 and the more subdued gray and silver plastic of the Power Mac G4 for a more serious industrial design, clad in aluminum. In the early 2000s, colorful computers were for consumers and monochrome computers were for <em>serious</em> computer users.<sup id="fnref-12429-gray"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-gray" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/specs/powermac_g5_1.8.html">Power Mac G5</a> design represented the high-end Mac tower for a decade, keeping its distinctive look outside while adapting and changing on the inside. It survived the Intel transition. The G5 design, with a front panel punched so full of holes that it was 65 percent aluminum and 35 percent air, was so logical for a computer packed full of hot, high-powered components that after a six year hiatus, Apple brought back a Mac Pro that is deeply inspired by the design of the original. Like its predecessor, the 2019 Mac Pro also looks like nothing more than a giant box grater.</p>
<h2>An executive briefing</h2>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-cover-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="power-mac-g5-cover" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Power Mac G5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwsn27J_tlo">was announced at WWDC in 2003</a> as “the world’s fastest personal computer.” Steve Jobs pointed out it was also the first 64-bit processor in a desktop computer, proudly trumpeting Apple’s partnership with IBM to create the G5 processor, which was replacing the Motorola-built PowerPC G4 at the top of Apple’s product line.</p>
<p>Apple was proud of the hardware design, so proud that I managed to score a hands-on briefing where I could walk through the design decisions with Apple execs for a cover story in Macworld. Macworld Expo in New York was coming up, so the only time we could meet was on the afternoon of July 3, the day before the long Independence Day weekend.</p>
<p>My wife and our one-year-old daughter and I were driving down to L.A. for the weekend, so we ended up stopping at Infinite Loop on the way south. A very nice Apple P.R. person (I wish I could remember who she was!) took them to the Company Store while I went into the executive briefing center. My daughter ended up with a new Apple onesie out of the deal.</p>
<p>The briefing was one for the books. Greg Jozwiak—who still frequently takes to the stage at Apple events—represented product marketing and Jon Rubinstein, Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering was there for the engineering side. For an hour, we stood around an opened-up G5 and walked through every little corner of that tower, as they told story after story about why particular design decisions had been made.</p>
<p>Today, that would be a podcast interview, and maybe a YouTube video. Back then, it generated three pages of photos showing both sides of the G5 motherboard, the inside of the case, and the front and back of the computer’s exterior, complete with quotes from both of them. It was an unusual way to do that story, right down to my insistence that we quote them at length and refer to them by their nicknames, Joz and Ruby.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-spread-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With 17 years of hindsight, the thing that sticks out the most about the G5’s design is just how obsessed it was about moving air around. Consider the two pro Macs that bracket this design: the previous tower, the final Power Mac G4, was nicknamed the “wind tunnel” because of its loud, aggressive fan noise. The 2013 Mac Pro, on the other hand, famously failed because it couldn’t keep its components cool enough, leading Apple into a “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">thermal corner</a>” from which it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The G5 was all about moving air around intelligently and quietly. In the WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs boasts about how it’s got nine fans, but you won’t hear them because they’re all individually computer controlled. If you took off the metal door on the outside of the G5, you’d be prompted by a clear plastic <em>second</em> door, this one there to keep the entire thermal container sealed. The power supply, processors, PCI cards, and storage bay were all separate air zones, moving from front to back.</p>
<p>Over the years, the airflow design on the inside changed as components changed, but the premise remained the same: Keep moving air through this thing so it can keep doing its job. It’s something the 2019 Mac Pro does, too. It’s a lesson learned from the Power Mac G5.</p>
<h2>Bunny suits and betrayal</h2>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/DSC01932-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Photo by Stephen Hackett.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t make Steve Jobs look like a fool. You will regret it.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/steve-jobs-ibm-2-6c.jpg">history between Jobs and IBM</a>, it’s quite a thing to consider just how much praise Jobs and Apple lavished on IBM during the launch of the Power Mac G5.</p>
<p>The truth is, when Jobs returned to Apple he found the company in a vulnerable position when it came to Mac processors. The PowerPC chip architecture used in every Mac was a constant sore spot. It’s not quite fair to say Macs were always slower than comparable PCs running Intel processors, but they frequently were—and even when they weren’t, they often lagged behind in sheer clock speed. Try explaining to someone that a 1.5GHz Motorola G4 processor is actually faster than a 1.7 GHz Intel processor—either they won’t believe you because one number is larger than the other, or their eyes will just glaze over in boredom. (It happened on stage at Macworld Expo New York once. True story.)</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote back in 2003:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Anyone who’s paid attention to the competitive world of desktop computers has noticed that as PC chip makers Intel and AMD have accelerated their chips to incredibly high clock speeds, the G4 has lagged behind. Lately, even Apple seemed to stop protesting that the gap was purely mathematical and not real.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple ended up hitching the future of Mac chip development to IBM, its other PowerPC alliance partner. IBM had been focusing on high-end workstation processors, and that seemed like a good fit for the Power Mac line, at least. Then Apple went to work doing its marketing thing, with that IBM relationship at the center. Steve Jobs held up a polished silicon wafer and showed photos of the IBM factory in Fishkill, New York, where the G5 was being made.</p>
<p>If anyone remembers Macworld Expo New York 2003, it’s as the last hurrah of the show in New York before it crept back to Boston to die. Jobs didn’t even appear, but there was still an Apple keynote (led by marketing head Phil Schiller) and a hefty Apple presence. I remember it differently, mostly because I was part of a group of journalists who took a field trip upstate to Fishkill to see the IBM factory. We put on white bunny suits and wandered through a series of clean rooms where robots created IBM’s cutting-edge processors, including the G5.</p>
<p>What a world! I’d written about Apple for a decade, only to suddenly find myself in an IBM factory. It wasn’t quite Microsoft HQ, but it still felt like being in the belly of the beast. But this was a new world. IBM and its chip-making prowess was now the savior of the Mac. A big, beautiful G5 future was ahead.</p>
<p>So, about that…</p>
<p>In hindsight, it’s clear that Steve Jobs placed a trust in IBM that it simply didn’t merit. I have to believe Jobs thought IBM could deliver 3GHz G5 chips within 12 months. (The G5’s fastest chip at launch was a dual 2GHz model—meanwhile, Intel was already selling 3GHz chips.) It was “a guarantee the likes of which Apple had never before offered,” as I wrote back then. Jobs seemed confident, IBM seemed confident, and they sold that confidence.</p>
<p>Apple shipped Macs with G5 processors for three years. There was <em>never</em> a 3GHz G5 chip. While there eventually was a G5 iMac, there was <em>never</em> a G5 laptop. The architecture wasn’t ever conducive to being used on mobile devices. Steve Jobs accepted an IBM projection, made a promise, hyped its relationship with IBM…and got burned.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened next: Apple revved up a secret project to ensure that Mac OS X could compile for Intel processors. Less than two years after members of the media frolicked in bunny suits in Fishkill, Apple announced that it was dumping the PowerPC entirely and moving to Intel.  A couple of years later, Apple finally reached 3GHz with a Mac tower and it was a Mac Pro powered by an Intel Xeon processor.</p>
<p>Also in the background, Apple had begun talking to other chip design companies about alternatives to the G5, desperately trying to find a new chip to power its laptops. One of those companies was P.A. Semi, which Apple ended up buying outright in 2008. P.A. Semi’s engineering team became Apple’s chipmaking team.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the ultimate lesson of the entire G5 affair: Steve Jobs, and through him Apple’s larger corporate culture, was reminded that if you are reliant on a partner for a crucial portion of your business, you can’t truly control that business. Making the G5 was a side hustle of a side hustle of a company in transformation—it just wasn’t that important to IBM, but it was vitally important for Apple.</p>
<p>Jobs and Apple learned their lesson. The acquisition of P.A. Semi led to the A series of processors that run the iPhone and iPad. They are widely considered to be superior to the processors used by Apple’s competition. And now Apple has picked up stakes once again and plans to make Macs powered by new versions of those processors.</p>
<p>You could argue that the Power Mac G5 has IBM’s failure inscribed in its very name. But I prefer to consider the aluminum cheese-grater design as a classic that bridged the gap between IBM and Intel. It was a design too good to throw away, and after a brief blip, it’s still with us today—albeit in a modernized form with more stainless steel and weirder holes.</p>

    <figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20macstitle.png?ssl=1" alt="20 Macs for 2020" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><p>I’ve been a professional observer of the Mac for three-quarters of its life. Sticking around that long—27 years—has given me a deeper perspective on its history. I remember the Mac before OS X, before the iMac, before PowerPC, even before System 7. We go way back.</p>
<p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks, I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them, counting down to number one.</p>
<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these are my favorite Macs—a bunch of them I only knew in passing and never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever—a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>
<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular, revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/">Baseball 100 project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable omissions.</p>
<p>To this, I can only say: My rankings may be terrible, and my omissions unforgivable, but they’re mine. Play along, make your own list, post it to the Internet, and see if everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Or as Posnanski put it, “The point of this for me is not the ranking but the stories.”</p>
<p>To take this walk down memory lane, I’ve read through many back issues of Macworld, MacUser, and MacWEEK, picked up a few books, and talked to some of my distinguished Mac journalism colleagues. I appreciate their contributions to the project.</p>
<p>Beyond the arguments about list-making, I hope the results of this project will expose some Mac history that deserves to be brought back into the light while entertaining along the way.</p>
<p>In addition to my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/20macs">weekly essays here at Six Colors</a>, there will be an <a href="https://relay.fm/20macs">accompanying podcast</a> at Relay FM, and a video series (made in collaboration with Stephen Hackett) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">the 512 Pixels YouTube channel</a>.</p>

    <p>One of the things that makes numerical computation interesting is that it often reverses the usual conceptual order of things, using advanced math to compute things that are introduced earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example I recently ran across [1]. The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/trig_hyperbolic.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \sinh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \cosh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)}{2} \\ \tanh(x) &amp;= \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)} \\ \end{align*} " width="222" height="131" /></p>
<p>But it may be more efficient to compute the exponential function in terms of hyperbolic functions. Specifically,</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_via_sinh.svg" alt="\exp(x) = \sinh(x) + \sqrt{\sinh(x)^2 + 1}" width="262" height="22" /></p>
<p>Why would you want to compute the simple thing on the left in terms of the more complicated thing on the right? Because hyperbolic sine is an odd function. This means that half its power series coefficients are zero: an odd function only has odd powers in its power series.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to compute the exponential function in an environment where you only have a limited number of registers to store constants. You can get more accuracy out of the same number of registers by using them to store coefficients in the power series for hyperbolic sine than for exp.</p>
<p>If we store <em>n</em> coefficients for sinh, we can include powers of <em>x</em> up to 2<em>n</em> &#8211; 1. And since the coefficient of <em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> is zero, the error in our Taylor approximation is <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup>2<em>n</em>+1</sup>). See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/07/27/sine-approximation-for-small-x/">this post</a> for more on this trick.</p>
<p>If we stored <em>n</em> coefficients for exp, we could include powers of <em>x</em> up to <em>n</em>-1, and our error would be <em>O</em>(<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>).</p>
<p>To make things concrete, suppose <em>n</em> = 3 and <em>x</em> = 0.01. The error in the exp function would be on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>, but the error in the sinh function would be on the order of 10<sup>-14</sup>. That is, we could almost compute exp to single precision and sinh to almost double precision.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m glossing over a detail here. Would you really need to store, for example, the 1 coefficient in front of <em>x</em> in either series? For simplicity in the argument above I&#8217;ve implicitly said yes. Whether you&#8217;d actually need to store it depends on the details of your implementation.)</p>
<p>The error estimate above uses big-oh arguments. Let&#8217;s do an actual calculation to see what we get.</p>
<pre>    from math import exp, sinh, sqrt
    
    def exp_taylor(x):
        return 1 + x + 0.5*x**2
    
    def sinh_taylor(x):
        return x + x**3/6 + x**5/120
    
    def exp_via_sinh(x):
        s = sinh_taylor(x)
        return s + sqrt(s*s + 1)
    
    def print_error(approx, exact):
        print(f"Computed: {approx}")
        print(f"Exact:    {exact}")
        print(f"Error:    {approx - exact}")
    
    x = 0.01
    approx1 = exp_taylor(x)
    approx2 = exp_via_sinh(x)
    exact   = exp(x)
    
    print("Computing exp directly:\n")
    print_error(approx1, exact)
    
    print()
    
    print("Computing exp via sinh:\n")
    print_error(approx2, exact)
</pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre>    Computing exp directly:

    Computed: 1.0100500000000001
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    -1.6708416783473012e-07

    Computing exp via sinh:

    Computed: 1.0100501670841682
    Exact:    1.010050167084168
    Error:    2.220446049250313e-16
</pre>
<p>Our errors are roughly what we expected from our big-oh arguments.</p>

    <p>If there’s a segment of Apple’s business that seems to fly in the face of the company’s philosophy—not just in terms of making a product that is substandard or lackluster—but in terms of actually being at odds with the way it otherwise does business, you couldn’t put forth a more prominent example than the App Store.</p>
<p>The discussion, always at a constant simmer in the Apple community, bubbled up once again last week even as Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled by lawmakers over antitrust concerns. Developers, regularly dissatisfied with the company’s lack of transparency and equality over rules, took the opportunity to renew criticism of not only that, but the hefty 30-percent cut of proceeds.</p>
<p>The App Store has been a profitable business for both developers and Apple in the decade-plus since its launch, but there’s a strong argument that as much of its benefits have accrued to those making the apps that feed it, just as much—if not more—has found its way into the coffers of the platform owner. Enough so that the company has built an entire fast-growing segment of its income around Services, amongst which the App Store is undoubtedly the crown jewel.</p>
<p>Apple’s impetus to keep on keeping on isn’t hard to understand. But, as the App Store embarks upon its second decade of operation, it may at least be worthwhile to investigate what changes could be made to improve it.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569278/time-for-apple-to-reevaluate-how-the-app-store-does-business.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1289710804338647040?s=20">@DongleBookPro</a> has today posted images of what seems to be a first-generation iPod Touch prototype with a 2013 Mac Pro-style glossy black finish.</p>
<p>  The Twitter user claims that the iPod Touch prototype pictured has &#8220;the same coating as the 2013 Mac Pro.&#8221; Had the finish been selected for the final product, it would have been the first metallic glossy black finish to be shipped on an Apple device.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the device:</p>

<p><strong>Classy free fonts</strong><br />
There are about 1,000 very classy fonts available for free on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. These are fonts you would actually want to use in your book or on your website. Some are commissioned by Google and designed by world-class typographers, such as the font Roboto used in Google maps. Many of these fonts come as families with different weights, italic, bold, extra glyphs, etc. This set of open fonts is also offered by Adobe and Monotype; what Google Fonts offer is a very nifty web interface for navigating through the collection, including good search and filter. I particularly like their font “pairing” function, which suggests good combinations of fonts (like text and captions pairings). All the fonts are license-free. — KK</p>
<p><strong>Craft in action</strong><br />
Everyone knows Anthony Bourdain’s various travel/food series, but in 2015 Bourdain did his hanging-out thing with master craftsman and craftswomen, going to their shops, watching them work with their tools, and at times trying his own hand at their craft. I can watch masters work all day. Their obsession with details is astounding, and their extreme excellence is captured in 14 episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdg0QhLNc29XuXmmv5Vu__bfNUeZI76ve&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Raw Craft</a>. The art ranges from hand-tailored suits to a traditional letter-press printer, all sponsored by a whiskey company, and available on YouTube. — KK</p>

<p><strong>Words of wisdom from GPT-2</strong><br />
GPT-2 is an application that produces novel text based on a text prompt (<a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/run-openais-new-gpt-2-text-generator-code-with-your-gpu/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Here’s how to install it</a>). Most of what it generates hovers on the border of sense and nonsense. Here are four pieces of advice it has given to me.  — MF</p>
<ul class="revue-ul">
<li>“If we cannot make sense of the present, we cannot plan for the future.”</li>
<li>“The more we change to meet the challenges in our lives, not to stay where we are, the more successful we will be.”</li>
<li>“If it is an animal you have seen, do you think it will be like you, too? This is the first statement of my doctrine, that all things are one thing. Do you want me to prove it, or to let it pass?” —Philosopher Epicurus (384-399 A.D.)</li>
<li>“Your gut tells you it’s not right to continue investing in some idea–it’s too risky, because its consequences are hard to understand. Your gut is right about one thing, though: there is no way of knowing it’s not wrong to spend your energy making the best decision for yourself and your goals.”</li>

<p><strong>Fun and powerful photo editing app</strong><br />
It’s incredibly fun to use the <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-award-winning-luminar-4-bundle?aid=a-j2ferhvk&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Luminar</a> photo editing application to bring my photos to life. (Here are some of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWnNav04OUZsflczhGitdZEpOTdBcVHd?usp=sharing&amp;utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">before-and-after photos</a>.) It has tons of adjustable preset filters and a lot of specialized tools such as portrait enhancement, where you can make the subject’s eyes larger and face thinner. You can also easily add in new skies and even a sun with rays. I typically use the “AI” set of adjustment tools to change the brightness and contrast because it does a great job without a lot of fussing on my part. The developer also has lots of excellent videos that show you how to use all the features in Luminar. Here’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/390496469?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">30-second video overview</a>. — MF</p>

It’s extremely absorbent and dries super fast. When I’m done with it, I just fold it up and put it in a drawer. It’s also machine washable. I love it. — CD</p>

    <p>Last week, Dan Moren wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/automate-this-how-hot-does-it-feel/">a nice post</a> about calculating the heat index in Shortcuts. I’d written a similar shortcut a few days earlier to calculate the dewpoint (it must be a summer thing), but it was kind of crappy and I had put it aside. Inspired by Dan’s work, I returned to my dewpoint shortcut and cleaned it up.</p>
<p>While I’m sure the dewpoint is included in some weather apps, it isn’t in the stock Weather app. It is, in theory at least, part of the data set returned by the <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> action in Shortcuts. I say “in theory” because I’ve found that quite often the Dewpoint entry is empty when that action is run. Why that is I don’t know, but that was the reason my original dewpoint shortcut was disappointing.</p>
<p>The improved shortcut, which you can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8443b306698142e2b0da7fd412c11045">download</a>, uses a calculation when <span class="menu">Get Current Weather</span> falls short. Here it is:</p>

<p>The <code>Weather Conditions</code> magic variable is used repeatedly in the shortcut to get at certain data. For example, when we need the temperature, we add <code>Weather Conditions</code> and choose Temperature from the list of data.</p>
<p><img alt="Specific info from weather conditions" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Specific%20info%20from%20weather%20conditions.jpg" title="Specific info from weather conditions" width="50%"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the name of the type of data chosen is displayed in the shortcut. For certain data, like Temperature, we also get to choose the units.</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing the units" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Choosing%20the%20units.jpg" title="Choosing the units" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Here’s the JavaScript code from Step 6:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:
 1:  function dewpoint(t, rh) {
 2:    let A = 17.625;
 3:    let B = 243.04;
 4:    let part = Math.log(rh/100) + A*t/(B + t);
 5:    return B*part/(A - part);
 6:  }
 7:  
 8:  let rh = ☐ Weather Conditions (Humidity);  // number
 9:  let t = '☐ Weather Conditions (Temperature)'; // string
10:  t = t.match(/[-\d.]+/);
11:  t = parseFloat(t);
12:  
13:  return dewpoint(t, rh)*9/5 + 32;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dewpoint</code> function is based on this equation:</p>

\[T_d = \frac{ B \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)   + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right]}{A - \left[ \ln \left( \frac{RH}{100} \right)  + A \frac{T}{B + T} \right] }\]

<p>This is a curve fit, where \(T\) is the normal (dry bulb) temperature in Celsius, \(RH\) is the relative humidity in percent, and \(T_d\) is the dewpoint in Celsius. The parameters that give a good fit are \(A = 17.625\) and \(B = 243.04\). I got the formula from <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225">this nice survey paper</a> by Mark Lawrence. Unfortunately, the paper has a typo in the value for \(A\), and I had to look up <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035&lt;0601:IMFAOS&gt;2.0.CO;2">the original paper</a> by Oleg Alduchov and Robert Eskridge to get the correct value. Scholarship!</p>
<p>One of the great things about doing inline Scriptable is that you can stick Shortcuts variables directly into your JavaScript. That’s what’s happening with those weird-looking parts of Lines 8 and 9. Within the Scriptable step itself, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Shortcuts%20variables%20in%20Scriptable.jpg" title="Shortcuts variables in Scriptable" width="50%"/></p>
<p>While the humidity is given as a number, the temperature is given as a string with “°C” at the end. Lines 10–11 extract the numeric part from the string<sup id="fnref:regex"><a href="#fn:regex" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and convert it from a string to a floating point number.</p>
<p>Finally, Line 13 converts the dewpoint temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Any complaints about this will be ignored.</p>
<p>Running Dewpoint directly from Shortcuts returns the output in this form:</p>
<p><img alt="Direct Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Direct%20Dewpoint%20output.png" title="Direct Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Running it in the Shortcuts widget on my phone returns the output within the widget:</p>
<p><img alt="Widget Dewpoint output" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200802-Widget%20Dewpoint%20output.jpg" title="Widget Dewpoint output" width="50%"/></p>
<p>This output is fine as written but not so good when spoken by Siri. There’s no pause between the temperature and the dewpoint. If experience shows that I’ll be using it mostly through Siri, I’ll change the Text definitions to be more like sentences.</p>

      • James Fallows | The Atlantic
      
        • by James Fallows
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve frequently mentioned my friend Michael Jones, a computer scientist and geography whiz. Nine years ago, he was a leading figure in my <em>Atlantic</em> story “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?utm_source=feed">Hacked</a>,” the saga of what my wife Deb and I learned when her email account was taken over by international hackers. For an <em>Atlantic</em> column around the same time, I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/googles-michael-jones-on-how-maps-became-personal/266781/?utm_source=feed">interviewed him</a> on the way omnipresent, always-available mapping was likely to change people’s habits and lives. And before any of this, he had added to world knowledge with his explanation of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">Boiled Frog</a>” science. As he laid out in this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/07/guest-post-wisdom-on-frogs/21789/?utm_source=feed">guest post</a>, careful experiments in 19th-century Germany established that a frog would indeed sit still in a pot of ever-hotter water—but only if its brain had already been removed.  </p><p>Outside our household, Michael Jones is known, among other things, as one of the guiding forces behind Google Earth and Google Maps. When you see your neighborhood, or your planet, from above on a computer, or follow turn-by-turn directions on your phone, he is one of the people you have to thank.</p><p>Among the bright sides in the current pandemic nightmare is the news that this spring Michael <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/?utm_source=feed">received the “Patron’s Medal”</a> from the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/">Royal Geographical Society</a>, in London. I am by nature wary of anything involving the concept of “Royal” (for reasons <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/?utm_source=feed">laid out long ago here</a>), but I make an exception in this case. I am delighted to learn of this overdue recognition for Michael Jones.</p><p>As the Society’s announcement put it:</p><blockquote>
<p>The 2020 Patron’s Medal has been awarded to Michael Jones for his contribution to the development of geospatial information.</p>

<p>Baroness Chalker said: “Michael Jones is a role model for future generations of geographers. From his beginnings as a software engineer, inventing and filing his own patents, through to his role as Google’s Chief Technology Advocate, his inspiring career trajectory is charted by his vision to redefine mapping from static lines and symbols to an interactive geographical web of context and information. It’s hard to overstate the importance that Google Earth and Google Maps has had on the public worldwide and how Michael’s pioneering work has democratised and popularised cartography and spatial awareness. Today we recognise his extraordinary contribution and his continued advocacy for the benefits of geography. He whole heartedly deserves the Society’s highest recognition.”</p>

<p>Michael Jones said: “This recognition is a signal honour for an idea that started in my head and which, through the work of many, resulted in the Google Earth used by billions of people around the world. On behalf of colleagues who laboured to make this dream of Earth and Maps a reality, and in full credit to the inspiring attainments of all who have come before us in the quest to better understand the Earth, I can only say that the ‘Earth-in-your-hand’ idea has never had a greater friend than the Royal Geographical Society, to whom we humbly offer our gratitude.”</p>
</blockquote><p>As a fellow Yank, I will razz Michael for writing “signal honour”—but it couldn’t be more deserved, with the British <em>u</em> or without. Congratulations.
