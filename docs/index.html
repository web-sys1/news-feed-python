    <p>Molly Hensley-Clancy and Caroline O’Donovan, reporting for BuzzFeed News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind a <a href="https://twitter.com/Freeyourmindkid/status/1290626349426671617">viral photo</a> of a crowded hallway at a high school in
Georgia, a potentially dire situation is brewing. Students,
teachers, and parents fear the Paulding County school’s rushed
reopening plans may be spiraling out of control just two days
after students — who said they were told they could face
expulsion for remaining home — returned to class despite reports
of positive coronavirus cases among students and staff. […]</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html">recommendations from CDC health officials</a>, the
district has called mask-wearing a “personal choice” and said
that social distancing “will not be possible to enforce” in “most
cases.” While the school provided teachers with face shields and
masks and encouraged staff and students to wear them, they are
not required and not all teachers have chosen to use them. One
North Paulding teacher resigned last month over concerns about
virus safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>School or death cult, you make the call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Wednesday, the school addressed the controversy that had
swirled around the viral photograph via an intercom announcement
from North Paulding High School principal Gabe Carmona. In it,
according to two people familiar with the situation, he stated
that any student found criticizing the school on social media
could face disciplinary consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that will certainly keep everyone healthy, and will teach the kids an important lesson on their First Amendment rights at the same time.</p>

    <p>Heather Kelly, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Team Trump’s tweet of a video clip from a Fox News interview — in
which President Trump said that children are “almost immune” from
COVID-19 — violates the site’s rules against misinformation, the
company said. Twitter hid the post and said the account will not
be able to tweet again until he deletes it, although it can appeal
the decision.</p>

<p>Twitter spokeswoman Liz Kelley said the tweet “is in violation of
the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation. The account owner
will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again.”</p>

<p>Facebook on Wednesday said it removed President Trump’s post of a
video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said that
children are “almost immune” from COVID-19, marking the company’s
increasingly tough stance on political speech amid heightened
pressure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worth emphasizing that this was the “Team Trump” campaign account, not Trump’s personal account, but still. It is bad enough that we’re caught in a nationwide quagmire over whether Facebook and Twitter should allow the president of the United States to shitpost lies, period. But lies that are resulting in schools opening to comply with Trump’s fantasy  that schools should open in areas where COVID-19 transmission is out of control are so far over the line, you can’t even see the line from there.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>
      Posted on 06 August 2020 at 1:05&thinsp;am
      • John D. Cook
      
        • by John
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>The Lagrange inversion formula can be used to find the power series for the inverse of a function. I wrote about a different approach this problem <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/02/24/invert-power-series/">a couple years ago</a>, that time using Bell polynomials. This time I&#8217;ll give a formula that is more direct and easier to remember.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a function <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) and can compute its derivatives. We want to find a power series for <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>) where <em>B</em>(<em>A</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>x</em>. We assume <em>A</em>(0) = 0 and <em>A</em>&#8216;(0) ≠ 0.</p>
<p>The <em>k</em>th coefficient in the power series for B(<em>x</em>) is given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif1.svg" alt="b_k = \frac{1}{k} [k-1] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k" width="179" height="47" /></p>
<p>where [<em>k</em> &#8211; 1] in front of a function means to take the (<em>k</em>-1)st coefficient in its power series.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s apply this to get the first few terms of the series for tangent. Since inverse tangent has a simpler power series than tangent, we&#8217;ll set <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) = arctan(<em>x</em>) so that <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>) is tangent, i.e. the inverse of the inverse tangent.</p>
<p>Of course we could just find the power series for tangent directly, and this is just a demonstration. Power series inversion is more useful when you can&#8217;t simply find the series for the inverse function directly.</p>
<p>We will compute the coefficients <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>3</sub>, and <em>b</em><sub>5</sub> to get a 5th order series for tangent. Why don&#8217;t we need to compute <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>4</sub>? Because tangent is an odd function, we know that its power series coefficients with even indices are zero.</p>
<p>(You can see that this happens in general by looking at the equation above. If <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) is an odd function, then <em>x</em> / <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) is even, and so are its <em>k</em>th powers. The coefficients with odd index in the power series for an even function are zero.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif2.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^1 &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{3}x^2 - \frac{1}{45}x^4 + \cdots \\ \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^3 &amp;= 1 + \phantom{\frac{1}{3}}x^2 + \frac{1}{15}x^4 + \cdots \\ \left(\frac{x}{\arctan(x)}\right)^5 &amp;= 1 + \frac{5}{3}x^2 + \frac{2}{15}x^4 + \cdots \end{align*}" width="295" height="151" /></p>
<p>So <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> equals the 0th coefficient in the power series for <em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>), which is 1.</p>
<p>Next <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> equals 1/3 times the 2nd coefficient in the power series for (<em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>))<sup>3</sup>, and so <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> = 1/3.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>b</em><sub>5</sub> equals 1/5 times the 4th coefficient in the power series for (<em>x</em>/arctan(<em>x</em>))<sup>5</sup>, and so <em>b</em><sub>3</sub> = 2/15.</p>
<p>This tells us the power series for tangent is given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif3.svg" alt="\tan(x) = x + \frac{1}{3} x^3 + \frac{2}{15}x^5 + \cdots" width="236" height="37" /></p>
<p>and we could check by computing the power series directly that these terms are correct.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we can extend the formula at the top of this post to include powers of the inverse function. That is, the coefficients in the power series for <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> are given by</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/lif4.svg" alt=" [k] ((B(x)^n) = \frac{n}{k} [k-n] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k [k] ((B(x)^n) = \frac{n}{k} [k-n] \left(\frac{x}{A(x)}\right)^k" width="259" height="47" /></p>
<p>which reduces to the formula up top when <em>n</em> = 1.</p>

    <p>New York Times correspondent Vivian Yee, from Beirut:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was just about to look at a video a friend had sent me on
Tuesday afternoon — “the port seems to be burning,” she said — when my whole building shook. Uneasily, naïvely, I ran to the
window, then back to my desk to check for news.</p>

<p>Then came a much bigger boom, and the sound itself seemed to
splinter. There was shattered glass flying everywhere. Not
thinking but moving, I ducked under my desk.</p>

<p>When the world stopped cracking open, I couldn’t see at first
because of the blood running down my face.</p>

    <p>Given the frequency with which I have to deal with audio, Rogue Amoeba’s apps are amongst the most indispensable tools in my arsenal.<sup id="fnref-12617-disclosure"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12617-disclosure" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> And one that I’ve grown increasingly fond of in recent years is <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/">SoundSource</a>, which has just gotten a massive upgrade in version 5.</p>
<p>SoundSource has always excelled at being a replacement for the traditional macOS menu bar audio widget, but I have a confession to make: for years, I’ve kept both SoundSource <em>and</em> the default widget in my menu bar, because the latter made it a little easier to switch audio inputs. But, since getting my hands on a pre-release version of SoundSource 5 a couple weeks back, I have bid adieu to macOS’s native widget for good. All SoundSource, all the way.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/soundsource5.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="SoundSource" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>SoundSource 5 can now be configured with an even more compact interface.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a few of the reasons why I made the switch: First, SoundSource 5 features a brand new interface that’s not only more attractive than its predecessor (which was certainly no slouch), but allows you to customize it to take up less room. I use both the new built-in Compact view as well as the ability to hide the application list when I don’t need it and, as a result, I end up with just the controls I need at my fingertips.</p>
<p>Likewise, SoundSource 5 includes the ability to get an alternate menu that’s like the built-in widget by right clicking on the menu icon, so you can easily change sound output and input for the system. And you can now permanently keep both input and output meters in the menu bar to see your levels at a glance. (There’s also an option for per-app volume levels if that’s a thing you need.) Finally, the SoundSource default menu bar icon now shows the volume level, à la the OS’s menu bar. In short: there’s no reason to keep around the built-in menu bar item at all.</p>
<p>That’s on top of all of SoundSource’s other new features, like being able to favorite certain apps, pin your effects window, search for audio units, and updated versions of the balance and equalizer controls, plus way more.</p>
<p>SoundSource is, as of this writing, at a special introductory price of $29, which is a solid deal for this app. If you owned version 4, you can upgrade at discounted rate, and if you’re not sure whether or not SoundSource is for you, there’s a free trial. But if you spend a lot of time working with audio, it’s a no brainer.</p>

    <p>Continuing our tour of Garden Grove—the part of it within a few hundred yards of my mother&#8217;s house, anyway—this is a gumdrop tree. (That&#8217;s not its official name, it&#8217;s just what Marian named it.) I thought that it looked sort of Dr. Seuss-ish standing there all by itself, so I took a picture of it. Then I blurred the background because . . . I don&#8217;t know. For some reason, I felt that it had even more of a Seuss-esque feel with the tree sharply etched against a vague background. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told lawmakers Wednesday that <strong>neither President Barack Obama nor Vice President Joe Biden attempted to influence the FBI’s investigation of incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn</strong> during a January 2017 Oval Office meeting with top national security officials.</p>
<p>“During the meeting, the president, the vice president, the national security adviser did not attempt to any way to direct or influence any investigation,” Yates said during sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

    <p>Dan Primack, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we report in Axios Pro Rata today, Apple has expressed serious
interest in buying TikTok.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s <em>not</em> what Primack reported! Primack reported that sources outside Apple <em>claim</em> Apple expressed interest in TikTok, not that Apple actually has expressed interest. The claim that Apple actually has expressed interest exists only in this tweet. The difference is significant if the sources in question were full of shit, which I think they were.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-8b508c77-6c80-46f6-96e5-b466398e06f6.html">From Axios’s Pro Rata newsletter</a>, which has already been walked back with a pretty clear statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s because Microsoft isn’t the only party kicking TikTok’s
tires, as Trump also said yesterday.</p>

<p>Multiple sources tell me that Apple has expressed interest, albeit
no sources inside of Apple, and that at least one other strategic
has expressed interest. Yes, it would be an unusual deal for
Apple, given that TikTok is a cross-platform app, and a bigger
political headache than Tim Cook may want (both here and in
China). But if anyone has the cash on hand…</p>

<p><em>[Update: An Apple spokesperson tells Axios that there are no
discussions about buying TikTok and the company isn’t
interested].</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-tiktok-treasury-demand-microsoft-sale-559acca3-45da-40ea-acbe-26aef7c8c0b0.html">Here’s an Axios article published an hour ago</a> with the same content as the newsletter, but with Apple’s blanket denial simply standing next to Primack’s unnamed sources (multiple!) claiming that they are. Either Primack’s sources lied to him and he ran it, or Apple is lying. There’s no middle ground.</p>

<p>“Albeit” is doing a lot of work in the phrase “albeit no sources inside of Apple”. Who would know <em>outside</em> of Apple? TikTok, presumably, and … the Trump administration? Primack couldn’t possibly have taken the word of anyone in the Trump administration at face value, right? So my best guess is that TikTok sources are making this up to drive the asking price higher.</p>

<p>It is extremely conspicuous that Apple flatly denied any interest. They will no-comment almost anything.</p>

<p><strong>About the bag</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://geni.us/8OtW8x?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Tactical Molle EDC Pouch</strong></a><strong> ($11)</strong><br />
I like this because it’s big enough to fit my wallet, phone, keys, pen and notebook. I got the one that comes with straps because with that much stuff in it pulls down my pants. The cell phone pouches in the front and back are padded to protect the screen and it fits up to an iPhone XS Max. The placement of the straps isn’t the best and the one I got frequently flips upside down if it’s not weighted right, so be mindful of that and don’t leave the zips open.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s inside the bag</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://geni.us/lB5B?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Sofirn SP31 v2.0 Tactical Flashlight</strong></a><strong> ($37)</strong><br />
This thing is BRIGHT. It uses a standard 18650 battery and comes with a charger. It has multiple brightness settings, the low setting is really useful for not blinding yourself in the dark. It remembers the last setting it was on. I use it all the time for finding stuff I’ve dropped in the car, behind the couch or under a table. It’s so bright you can use it for finding a tiny screw you’ve dropped in a shag pile carpet by looking for the reflection.</p>
<p><a href="https://geni.us/FWAvYm8?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Nite Ize INKA Key Chain Pen</strong></a><strong> ($12)</strong><br />
Nite Ize bought Inka and these pens were really hard to find for a while but I’m glad they are back on Amazon because I’ve subsequently lost a Fisher Space bullet pen in the meantime. These use the space pen refills but due to the screw on cap, this pen is less likely to fall out of your bag. Also has a resistive touch screen pen cap on the other side, which are making a comeback in the days of COVID and nobody wanting to touch the ones on credit card machines. People are saying in the reviews they are not as good as the originals made by Inka, I haven’t had the new one long enough to say, but so far it seems good for the price, which is about half what the originals were.</p>

This is the only wallet I’ve found which will hold all my cards, cash, and a tile slim without the massive bulge of most wallets. It looks huge but it fits in most pockets, and so far it’s lasted me over 5 years. The card slots can get loose after a few years, but just jam some business cards in there. They have an RFID blocking version now too.</p>
<p><a href="https://geni.us/S0hVKM?utm_campaign=What%27s%20in%20my%20bag%3F&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>RFID blocking car key case</strong></a><br />
These are the cheapest ones I could find on Amazon and they absolutely work. If your car is parked close enough to your house that you can unlock it from inside then you need these to protect from thieves that use range extenders to pretend to be your key. They can open the door to your car, steal everything in it, and in some cases even start the car and drive off. We put our keys in these as soon as we get out of the car now.</p>

I’m excited to see what the developers of some of my favorite apps do with them over the coming months.</p>
<p>However, I can’t help but think that we’ll all suffer from a little Widget Madness before scaling back to what we find truly useful.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that I don’t think widgets will be popular and successful — I just think that there will see a spike in popularity before things level off.</p>
<p>Of course, not all technology that Apple ships does level off. Some things miss the mark with consumers and wither on the vine. Here are a few examples in recent history that come to mind for me.</p>
<h2>iMessage Apps</h2>
<p>With 2016’s iOS 10, Apple attempted to make Messages more than just a replacement for SMS that could sync between all of a user’s devices. That year, the company announced iMessage apps and sticker packs.</p>
<p>The first was a wide-ranging vision of what the iMessages app could become through the power of third-party applications being able to do their thing right inline with a text conversation. No longer would a user have to jump out to another app to schedule a meeting or order food or even play a game — they could do it all without leaving their conversation.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>

    <p>With Tuesday’s announcement of the new 27-inch iMac, Apple seems to be clearing out some of the final major Intel Mac releases in its product pipeline.</p>
<p>The big question is, what’s next for the iMac? While this new revision makes the current iMac a bit faster and a bit nicer, it’s a fairly modest upgrade. With the move to Apple silicon on the horizon, it’s worth pondering where the iMac goes from here—and how soon we might see truly big changes when it comes to Apple’s most popular desktop computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

    <p>Apple’s automated tools mistakenly flagged developer Charlie Monroe’s account as malicious this week, <a href="http://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">wreaking havoc with his business</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is the message macOS shows to all users who try to launch my app. That it will damage their computer with a checkbox to report malware enabled. Average user immediately goes nuts. I fully understand that the entire idea here is that Apple can remotely kill malware and to keep the user on the safe side, but can’t they differentiate between individual cases? Can’t they add revocation reason and in case they just revoke the developer’s certificate for non-malware reasons show something along the lines “This app needs an update from the developer, please contact the developer.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Apple has remedied the problem and apologized, Monroe brings up some great points here. Given that Apple has all the power in this relationship, the fact that they don’t provide a way to quickly get in touch when something devastating like this happens feels pretty crappy. I’m sure Monroe doesn’t yet have a clear picture of how much this might have damaged his relationship with his users.</p>
<p>Apple might like to disingenuously compare itself to a brick and mortar store, but is there really an analogous case where something like this happens overnight to an independent supplier, with little ability for recourse?</p><p><a href="http://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/developers-app-store-account-erroneously-flagged-as-malicious/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

<p id="p2">One trend that emerged from stay-home orders this year is that many people have spent more time cooking than ever before. Many restaurants have been unable to offer indoor dining, and the lack of a commute as much of society adjusted to work-from-home life provided the opportunity to spend more time in the kitchen. Bread baking became <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/health/bread-baking-health-benefits-coronavirus-wellness/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">a popular habit</a>, but so did home cooking in general. All of this has brought an influx of new entrants to cooking.</p>
<p id="p3">I&rsquo;m not new to cooking, but I&rsquo;ve nonetheless found myself in the market for a better solution for recipe management, meal planning, and cooking walkthroughs. The app I&rsquo;ve found best suited for my needs is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-cooking-companion/id1461650987?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crouton</a>, from developer Devin Davies.</p>
<p id="p4">Crouton offers a handful of valuable aids for cooking, but the feature at the center of it all is the app&rsquo;s recipe management system. Once you have recipes stored in the app, you can view those recipes in a well-designed, intuitive format, but you&rsquo;ll also be able to easily assign recipes to your weekly meal plan, add ingredients to your grocery list, or be guided through step-by-step instructions while cooking.</p>
<p id="p5"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p6">To get started adding recipes, there are a few options available: you can create new recipes via manual entry, import recipes from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paprika</a>, or import recipes from the web. I used the Paprika importer my first day with the app and it saved me a lot of time. Since then, my primary method of adding recipes has been via web imports. While there&rsquo;s unfortunately no share extension or action extension to do this directly from Safari, Crouton&rsquo;s web importer is nearly as pain-free an experience. Copy the URL for a recipe you found online to the clipboard, then open Crouton and you&rsquo;ll see a pop-up offering to import that recipe into your collection. You can modify any details you&rsquo;d like, but in my experience the web importer has done a solid job on every try.</p>
<p id="p7">Recipes can be sorted into folders you create, otherwise they all live in the default &lsquo;All Recipes&rsquo; folder. One nice touch is that recipes can be stored in multiple folders at once, making it more like a tagging system than a traditional folder approach. It&rsquo;s an important detail since plenty of recipes don&rsquo;t fit neatly into a single category.</p>

<p id="p9">My two favorite aspects of Crouton are its intuitive modern design for parsing recipes and the ease of adding those recipes to a meal plan.</p>
<p id="p10">On a recipe&rsquo;s detail screen, everything is neatly organized in a layout that makes sense. Rounded rectangles are used to house each of the different blocks of data available for recipes, such as prep and cook times, the ingredients list, and numbered step-by-step cooking directions. As someone who considers himself barely more than a cooking novice, Crouton&rsquo;s playful aesthetics help make recipes feel more approachable to me.</p>
<p id="p11">Another thing I appreciate about the recipe detail screen is that it&rsquo;s not over-cluttered with features you may not care about; rather, every feature has been thoughtfully added and fits well into the layout of the page. Those features include the ability to scale a recipe&rsquo;s ingredients for the number of people you&rsquo;re feeding, hit the play button to enter cooking mode and get one instructional step on-screen at a time, tap the shopping cart item to easily add select ingredients to your grocery list, and share the recipe in a variety of formats &ndash; the PDF option even lets you customize the document&rsquo;s design and contents.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/fb039a5f-45a8-4d05-9b9d-ad6bbbc3197f.png" alt="Cooking mode is great on the iPad, where ingredients are visible on the left and instructions on the right."><p class="image-caption">Cooking mode is great on the iPad, where ingredients are visible on the left and instructions on the right.</p></div>
<p id="p13">Speaking of cooking mode, the most natural way to cycle through each instructional step is to swipe through them, or use the arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen. But it&rsquo;s worth noting that there&rsquo;s a hands-free mode too on devices featuring the TrueDepth camera system. Developer Devin Davies has implemented a clever way of using the TrueDepth camera&rsquo;s face detection features such that you can wink at your device to have it cycle through cooking steps. A right wink moves to the next step and a left wink moves backwards. So if you can set your compatible iPhone or iPad Pro at a level where it can see your face well, this is a convenient way to keep dirty hands away from your device. You can enable this feature via the eye icon in the top-right corner of cooking mode.</p>
<p id="p14">Meal planning has a dedicated tab in Crouton&rsquo;s tab bar, and consists of a simple list of current and upcoming days in descending order. Tap a day and you&rsquo;ll see your collection of recipes, sorted into their appropriate folders, for you to choose from. You can add either a single recipe to a day, or multiple recipes to cover not only the main entree but also any sides and/or dessert you plan to prepare. There&rsquo;s nothing innovative about the way any of this works, but there doesn&rsquo;t need to be &ndash; its simplicity is its strength.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/b6b9430d-bcb8-45a0-b0cb-402b6dcd33bb.png" alt="Recipe folders (left) and the meal planner with a web recipe import pop-up (right)."><p class="image-caption">Recipe folders (left) and the meal planner with a web recipe import pop-up (right).</p></div>
<p id="p16">I don&rsquo;t use the grocery function of Crouton, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that it&rsquo;s very easy to add ingredients from your recipes to the in-app Groceries tab, which can also hold grocery items you manually add. The best part is that this tab can be synced with Reminders, so that the contents of your grocery list in reminders is reflected in Crouton as well, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p17">Finally, Crouton comes equipped with the sort of system features you would expect from a modern app. Dark mode support enables automatic theme switching, context menus are used throughout the UI, and you can choose from a selection of alternate app icons for your Home screen. Near and dear to my heart, there&rsquo;s an iPad client that supports Split View and Slide Over multitasking, and the app also takes good advantage of the larger display with a two-panel layout. I&rsquo;ve found the iPad app especially useful while in the process of cooking, since I can sit the device in Magic Keyboard atop our kitchen island and swipe through cooking directions one page at a time.</p>
<hr id="hr18"><p id="p19">Crouton makes meal planning easy, provides a beautiful way to store and view your recipes, and plays a key role in the cooking process. I&rsquo;m not someone who cooks more than once or twice a week, so it&rsquo;s possible that for someone more active in the kitchen there are advanced features missing that I&rsquo;m unaware of, but I&rsquo;ve found that Crouton offers exactly what I need in this type of app. It&rsquo;s modern, keeps things simple in a good way, and offers valuable utility with style.</p>
<p id="p20">Crouton is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-cooking-companion/id1461650987?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">free download on the App Store</a>, with a one-time In-App Purchase available to remove recipe storage limits.</p>

    <p>What is the most effective thing an individual can do about climate change? There are lots of possible answers: what you eat, how you vote, where and how you live, how you travel, and so on. All of them matter. For Americans, at this moment, the one that matters most may be how you vote.</p><p>But among the steps most immediately within many people’s control, an important one is <em>planting trees</em>. Yes, there <a href="https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/01/13/plant-a-trillion-trees/content.html">are cautions</a> about doing this in the wrong way, or in the wrong places, or in ignoring the legacies of long-standing biases in zoning and city planning. (That is: It’s easy to plant trees in spacious residential neighborhoods; it’s harder when there’s only a narrow strip of ground between the street and a building front.) But overall, step-by-step reforestation can potentially be a significant help, which is why Deb Fallows and I have been chronicling a number of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/599764/?utm_source=feed">local efforts</a> toward <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/planting-a-trail-of-giants/601276/?utm_source=feed">that end</a>.</p><p>I am chagrined to say that until I looked into it, I had no idea that the second-largest city in the nation—Los Angeles, with its population of nearly 4 million people spread out over roughly 500 square miles—has a very ambitious program to use tree planting as an axis to connect job creation, climate sustainability, urban renewal, and economic equity and inclusion. (Perhaps it would have helped if I’d read at least the headline of <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/los-angeles-green-new-deal-forest-officer/">a very good <em>Mother Jones</em> story</a> by Jackie Flynn Mogensen last year. The headline was, “Los Angeles, a City Known for Its Freeways, Is About to Plant a Shit Ton of Trees.”)</p><p>As it happened, I learned about the LA program largely by accident. The smallish Southern California town of Redlands had set an also-ambitious goal, of helping school children there plant more than 12,000 trees, which I wrote <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/599764/?utm_source=feed">about when it was announced last year</a>. The seedlings were purchased; a computerized way to map and track each one’s progress was set; and they were supposed to be passed out to school children on Earth Day this past April. That plan naturally hit a roadblock when California schools were shut down. As an alternative, the backers of the effort,  including the <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/">University of Redlands</a> and the tech company <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Esri</a>, managed <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/alumni/trees-please/">to give away</a> thousands of trees in June. But still some 4,000 seedling trees went unclaimed.</p><p>Mainly through the efforts of our friend <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/alumni/meet-the-staff/shelli-stockton/">Shelli Stockton</a>, of the University of Redlands, those little trees ended up last month in the hands of an organization called <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/">City Plants</a> in Los Angeles (as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Wr4rbwqaI&amp;feature=youtu.be">this video</a>). City Plants, a program of the LA city government, is part of a broader LA effort toward radical expansion of the “urban forest” cover in this famously sunbaked part of the world.</p><p>I talked this week with <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/our-team/">Rachel O’Leary</a>, a native Angeleno who now directs City Plants, and with Rachel Malarich, a longtime expert in urban forestry who last year was named LA’s first-ever <a href="https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-names-rachel-malarich-la%E2%80%99s-first-ever-city-forest-officer">City Forest Officer</a>. Here is what they told me about what they are doing, and why it might matter elsewhere.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><em>How City Plants started</em>: Last year, in presenting his “Green New Deal” vision for the city (which you can download in <a href="https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf">full PDF version here</a>), Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti set out a tree-planting campaign as one element of a larger sustainability-and-jobs strategy. The plan set a target to “plant and maintain” at least 90,000 trees across the city by 2021, and to keep planting trees at a rate of 20,000 per year. This was largely initially based on the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/38102">“Million Trees” initiative</a> under Garcetti’s predecessor, Antonio Villaraigosa, but has evolved over the past decade to focus on planting the "right tree in the right place." Garcetti's Green New Deal also was explicitly focused on “canopy equity”—that is, of extending more of the benefits of large-tree cover to neighborhoods that are now typified by asphalt and concrete rather than greenery.</p><figure class="right"><img alt="" height="480" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/08/TreeSign/9262ffef7.png" width="350"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of Shelli Stockton</figcaption></figure><p><em>What it does:</em> The City Plants program, as part of the larger urban-forestry program, offers trees to residents of Los Angeles at no cost. Angelenos can get up to seven free “<a href="http://www.cityplants.org/our-programs/yard-trees/">yard trees</a>” for their own property, which they are expected to plant and care for themselves (with instructions like those shown in this picture). They can also request free “<a href="http://www.cityplants.org/our-programs/street-trees/street-trees-for-your-neighborhood/">street trees</a>,” which a City Plants team will plant for them. (Residents must agree to water the trees for five years.)</p><p>For the labor involved in planting and handling the trees, City Plants coordinates <a href="https://www.cityplants.org/partners/">with a variety</a> of nonprofit and neighborhood groups —of which its major partner is the <a href="https://www.lacorps.org/">LA Conservation Corps</a>. This LACorps is designed to give young people workplace skills, while they work on projects of larger community value.</p><p><em>How is it financed?</em> From a variety of public and private sources (<a href="https://www.cityplants.org/sponsors/">info here</a>), but mainly by LA’s main public utility, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or LADWP. Long-standing policy in California requires utility companies to underwrite energy-efficiency programs, including tree planting. LADWP has supported tree planting and innovations in urban forestry in Los Angeles for over a decade. The rationale for including trees as energy-savers, which you can find in longer and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/research/highlights/highlights_display.php?in_high_id=688">more detailed form here</a>, is not just that tree growth stores carbon directly, as the trees mature. It is also that leafed-out tree cover reduces electricity and water use, especially the demand for air-conditioning. With support from LADWP, City Plants has an online calculator in which residents enter their street address, and get estimates of energy-bill savings from planting trees, in real time.</p><p>“Trees are one of the least expensive, and most powerful, tools we have for improving our environment,” Rachel Malarich told me. “More and more research is showing how important a good, healthy tree canopy cover is for our communities as a whole—and how important it will be not just for our health right now but for our resilience in the face of a changing climate.” (Malarich went into more detail on these features in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/los-angeles-green-new-deal-forest-officer/">the <em>Mother Jones</em></a> interview.)  </p><figure><img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/IMG_7420_copy/4df5583be.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of City Plants</figcaption></figure><p><em>The program’s other ambitions:</em> The 90,000-tree program concentrates on the parts of LA that are now the least forested and most parched. These are of course generally the lowest-income areas, and the most likely to become broiling “heat islands” because of climate change. The official goal, set out in the Green New Deal document, is to “Increase tree canopy in areas of greatest need by at least 50% by 2028 to grow a more equitable urban forest that provides cooling, public health, habitat, energy savings, and other benefits.”</p><p>I asked Rachel Malarich how that would be possible, considering that many areas now short on trees are also short on space to plant them. The extensive suburban-style portions of Los Angeles were designed to include leafy glades; others have barely an unpaved square inch to support plant growth.</p><p>“Trees need space to grow, and much of our infrastructure was set up not to allow that space,” Malarich said. “Frequently in these high-need areas you’ll only have a four-foot-wide parkway, where you can only plant a small tree. Or there are overhead power lines.” I asked, given these realities, how the city could realistically expect to equalize tree coverage across the city. It would be complex, and hard, and would involve short- and long-term creativity and planning, she said. But that was the deadline the city’s plan set out, “putting our feet to the fire.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/07/27219930174_0184440111_o_copy/2eabf1d73.jpg" width="672"><figcaption class="caption">Tree planters making the most of the space available, in Los Angeles (Courtesy of City Plants)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Does it matter outside LA</em>? The scale of Los Angeles makes anything that happens there consequential in its own right. But Rachel O’Leary argued that the partnership model—connecting different parts of the city and state government, and linking job-training and community-justice initiatives to climate sustainability—would be “replicable and scalable in other places.”</p><p>“Trees are a powerful tool of climate resilience,” she said. “This is definitely one of the most powerful actions a resident can take, to take climate change into their own hands. That it is how we view it here in this city. And we would encourage other cities to develop partnerships like these.”</p><p>“We’re not the only city that is dealing with this,” Rachel Malarich said. “If we can figure out this way of dealing with this issue of tree canopy inequity, we will have figured out something for other people to look at and learn from.”</p><p>Is any of this “the” answer, for neighborhood justice, civic engagement, and climate sustainability. Obviously not. But it could well be part of an answer, in this large city and elsewhere.</p><div class="feedflare">

    <p class="">A few years ago, I was looking to solve a problem that, in hindsight, didn’t need solving. Specifically, I wanted to have a system in place for legal clients to have easy access to their digital documents. After some research and trials (why are nearly all legal-focused software/services terrible?), I ended up&nbsp;<a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back" target="_blank">choosing Basecamp</a>. </p><p class="">I have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=jason%2Bfried&amp;sprefix=Jason%2Bfrie%252Caps%252C198&amp;crid=1B5AV4U59TTRX&amp;tag=tag%3Dmacs03-20&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_10" target="_blank"><span>read several books by Basecamp’s founders</span></a><span>,</span>&nbsp;and I believed (and continue to believe) in the company. So I spent time and money making the transition of many legal files into a Basecamp install and spent client attention getting them into the system. This was no small investment for me. Basecamp costs $1,000 per year. Moreover, it is a web service and not particularly automation friendly. I figured out work-arounds, but my traditional bag of tricks did not work, and everything I did in relation to my legal files took … just … a … little … longer.</p><p class="">OmniFocus recently reminded me that I am a few months away from my annual Basecamp renewal, so I spent some time looking into my usage. In doing so, I realized that only 3% of my clients were using it as I envisioned. I spoke with a few clients about this, and one explained to me, “Dave, I’m paying you for a service. Don’t make me learn software to do so.”</p><p class="">In short, my Basecamp experiment crashed and burned. So over the last few months, I have been pulling my legal data out of Basecamp, and I am now sorting out a more traditional, local file system for that data. There were other benefits available on Basecamp that I will miss, specifically the ability to easily combine documents, notes, email, and other data on a per-transaction basis. So now I am neck-deep in JavaScript and creating tools in Drafts, Hazel, Keyboard Maestro, Shortcuts, and all the other bits to replicate those features locally. It’s all working out, and it probably would not surprise you to learn that I am enjoying building out the new automation.</p><p class="">There is, however, a plot twist. The purpose of the Basecamp experiment was to solve a perceived problem with the law practice, but since I had the account, I also started using it for administration of the MacSparky bits. My virtual assistant liked Basecamp and, from the beginning, it was a very convenient place for us to work together. I spent some time looking at other collaboration tools and none of them are particularly appealing. So while I am going shut down my paid account, I will remain in Basecamp with a free personal account, limited to three projects. That is plenty for us to keep things rolling at MacSparky.</p><p class="">Plan on future posts here about automation and file management since now I am neck-deep in it.</p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/opinel.jpg" /></p><p>I have been carrying an <a href="https://geni.us/opinel">Opinel #10</a> for more than 20 years as my everyday carry pocket knife. I have a ranch with draft horses, permaculture orchards, and have a business <a href="http://piukuleles.com/">making ukuleles</a>, and my #10 is used all day long. From cutting twine on hay bales, tree grafting, removing splinters from my hand to fine detail work making musical instruments… it does it all. I prefer the carbon blade for the fine edge it takes.</p>
<p>It also has a unique blade lock integrated into the handle that rotates to lock the blade open or closed. They have been making these knives in France since 1890 and in 1985 the Victoria and Albert Museum consecrated the Opinel knife one of the 100 best-designed objects in the world. I could not agree more!</p>
<p>When I purchased my first Opinel, I purchased a back up at the same time and to this day, the backup knife has remained in its packaging. I have never needed to replace my original. The beechwood handle has taken on a beautiful patina from the decades of use. I have never found an equal in function or beauty for an everyday carry pocket knife!</p>

    <p>This is good news, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lawmakers-say-they-cant-return-home-without-coronavirus-deal-while-white-house-aides-are-split-on-use-of-executive-powers/2020/08/04/b19e7404-d688-11ea-b9b2-1ea733b97910_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_bailouthill-524pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">or as close as we get to it these days:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House and Democratic leaders agreed to try to finalize a deal to address lapsed unemployment benefits and eviction restrictions by the end of this week and hold a vote in Congress next week, <strong>suddenly trying to rush stalled talks in the face of growing public and political unrest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect the sudden interest in cutting a deal has more to do with the fact that the Senate goes on a monthlong recess starting Friday, and even Republicans don&#8217;t want this hanging over their heads during their visits home. Which is fine. If that&#8217;s what it takes to motivate Republicans to reach an agreement, I&#8217;ll take it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also impressed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/coronavirus-cases.html">this statement from Mitch McConnell:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The American people, in the end, need help,”</strong> Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters. “And wherever this thing settles between the president of the United States and his team that has to sign it into law and the Democrat not-insignificant minority in the Senate and majority in the House is something I am prepared to support, even if I have some problems with certain parts of it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not bad, coming from a Republican leader. No, really.</p>

    <p>August is sold out on the DF weekly sponsorship schedule, but September is mostly open. (October too, if you’re planning ahead.)</p>

<p>One sponsor per week, with a sponsor-written entry in the RSS feed to start the week, a thank-you post right on the homepage from me at the end, and the one and only graphic ad on every page of the site all week long. No tracking or other privacy-invasive bullshit. Just plain honest ads. My best argument that they work: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">the number of repeat companies in the sponsor archive list</a>.</p>

<p>So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, <a href="mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship">I’d love to have you as a sponsor</a>.</p>

    <p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/04/27-inch-imac-update">noted this morning</a> regarding the updated 27-inch iMac that the high end RAM configurations are pricey — $1,000 for 64 GB and $2,600 for 128 GB. You can get the same DDR4 memory upgrades from OWC for $300 and $600, respectively, and the new 27-inch iMac <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">still has user-accessible RAM</a>, so it doesn’t take particularly expert skill to install.</p>

    <p>Craig Mod:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Kissa by Kissa: How to Walk Japan (Book One)</em> is a book about
walking 1,000+km of the countryside of Japan along the ancient
Nakasendō highway, the culture of toast (toast!), and
mid-twentieth century Japanese cafés called <em>kissaten</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks gorgeous — wonderful typography and photography, expertly printed and bound. A genuine artifact.</p>

<p>Also, that bastard Mod went so far as to build and release as open source <a href="https://github.com/cmod/craigstarter">what he’s calling Craigstarter</a>, a Kickstarter-like crowdfunding tool for Shopify. Just bought my copy and the whole process was <em>smooth</em>.</p>

<p>Daniel Goleman was a science reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>, was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and received the American Psychological Association’s Lifetime Achievement Award for his media writing. Here’s advice from his book, <a href="https://geni.us/emotional-iq"><em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware of your emotions as they occur</strong><br />
“A belligerent samurai, an old Japanese tale goes, once challenged a Zen master to explain the concept of heaven and hell. The monk replied with scorn, ‘You’re nothing but a lout — I can’t waste my time with the likes of you!’</p>
<p>His very honor attacked, the samurai flew into a rage and, pulling his sword from its scabbard, yelled &#8216;I could kill you for your impertinence.’<br />
&#8216;That,’ the monk calmly replied, &#8216;is hell.’</p>
<p>Startled at seeing the truth in what the master pointed out about the fury that had him in its grip, the samurai calmed down, sheathed his sword, and bowed, thanking the monk for the insight.</p>
<p>&#8216;And that,’ said the monk, &#8216;is heaven.’</p>
<p>The sudden awakening of the samurai to his own agitated state illustrates the crucial difference between being caught up in a feeling and becoming aware that you are being swept away by it. Socrates’s injunction &#8216;Know thyself’ speaks to the keystone of emotional intelligence: awareness of one’s own feelings as they occur.”</p>
<p><strong>Lead by persuading people to work toward a common goal</strong><br />
“Leadership is not domination, but the art of persuading people to work toward a common goal.”</p>
<p><strong>Understand the value of sadness</strong><br />
“[Sadness] enforces a kind of reflective retreat from life’s busy pursuits, and leaves us in a suspended state to mourn the loss, mull over its meaning, and, finally, make the psychological adjustments and new plans that will allow our lives to continue.”</p>
<p><strong>Understand that worrying isn&#8217;t magic</strong><br />
“The worry habit is reinforcing in the same sense that superstitions are. Since people worry about many things that have a very low probability of actually occurring — a loved one dying in a plane crash, going bankrupt, and the like —there is, to the primitive limbic brain at least, something magical about it. Like an amulet that wards off some anticipated evil, the worry psychologically gets the credit for preventing the danger it obsesses about.“</p>

    <p class="">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/"><span>released an update to the iMac today</span></a>.

There is no model sold solely with a spinning drive. The low end is a 256GB SSD. Although the Fusion drive still lives.</p></li><li><p class="">The FaceTime camera is upgraded to the same 1080p camera in the iMac Pro. I’ve shot video for some of the Field Guides with that camera. It’s a nice upgrade, particularly during these strange times.</p></li><li><p class="">The iMac now has the T2 chip. Hooray.</p></li><li><p class="">You can spec the RAM up to 128GB and the storage up to 8TB (for <em>just</em> an additional $2,400.00).</p></li></ul><p class="">Overall, a nice update. It’s nice to see Apple giving spec-bump updates to its hardware. That said, there are lots of rumors about a redesign of the iMac in the pipeline. I’m guessing that will arrive with the first Silicon iMacs. IF it is going to be a touch screen, wouldn’t it be cool if they put it on a hinge like the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-studio-2/8SBJXM0M58T4"><span>Microsoft Surface Studio</span></a>?</p><p class="">If you need a new iMac, these look great.

<blockquote cite="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/"><p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity, next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And now the stunning Retina 5K display on the 27-inch iMac features True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts the color temperature of the display to match a user&rsquo;s ambient lighting.</p>
<p>The new iMac offers a nano-texture glass option &mdash; first introduced on Pro Display XDR &mdash; for even better viewing under various lighting conditions, such as a bright room or indirect sunlight.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/imac-mid-2020/">
<p>Maybe the best news here is that it is no longer possible to get a spinning hard disk in any Mac. Recent versions of MacOS, whether because of system changes or <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2019/09/12/analysis-apfs-enumeration-performance-on-rotational-hard-drives">APFS</a>, simply <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/11/27/poor-mac-performance-without-a-ssd/">do not work acceptably</a> when running on hard disks. Fusion drives are not much better, but I understand why it is an option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alas, storage is still way overpriced. The $1,800 base model has a 256 GB SSD, and <em>upgrading</em> to 1 TB costs $400. Quality 1 TB SSDs retail for around $100 these days.</p>

<p>Really hope repairability laws will compel Apple to make RAM and storage user upgradable across their line, a 4x markup on retail prices for commodity parts like RAM is just not right.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/"><p>Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987. In this role, which reports to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Schiller will continue to lead the App Store and Apple Events. Greg (Joz) Joswiak, a longtime leader within the Product Marketing organization, will join the executive team as senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life.

<p>Running the App Store is a big enough job by itself. It didn&rsquo;t make sense to keep it under Services, and combining it with Marketing only made sense to the extent that Apple wanted Schiller in charge of it. It will be interesting to see how long he continues in that role and who will be next.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Cat on a Patio, 2020.&#8221; On a technical note, this is a panoramic shot. I took the picture of the cat and then lowered the camera to take a close-up picture of the bricks. The two frames were stitched together into a single vertical picture in Photoshop, which I cropped into (almost) a square. It would take a seriously expensive wide-angle lens to do this in a single shot.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/">Apple PR:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987. In this role, which reports to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Schiller will continue to lead the App Store and Apple Events. Greg (Joz) Joswiak, a longtime leader within the Product Marketing organization, will join the executive team as senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I can&#8217;t help but think his oversight of the App Store and the company&#8217;s events won&#8217;t last for long, I think the marketing group is in good hands with Joz. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed his presentation style and he&#8217;s been at the company for two decades.</p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Phil-Schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow_08042020.jpg" alt="Papa Phil" /></p>
<p>Schiller himself has had quite a career with Apple. Again, from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Schiller has helped guide Apple’s products as well as its marketing for 30 years. He most recently led the effort to plan and execute Apple’s first-ever virtual Worldwide Developers Conference. The event, notable both for its innovative software and hardware announcements as well as its creative and much-praised execution, set a new standard for what virtual events can achieve in the era of COVID-19.</p>
<p>  “It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many products I love, with all of these great friends — Steve, Tim, and so many more,” said Schiller. “I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life. I’ll keep working here as long as they will have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.”

    <p>After hearing Donald Trump blather away about how great the United States has done in its battle with COVID-19—based on a completely meaningless statistic—perhaps you&#8217;d like to see how we&#8217;re <em>really</em> doing. Here you go:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_857113"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1261px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-857113" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_covid19_deaths_per_million_august_4_2.gif" alt="" width="1261" height="630"></figure>
<p>We are the seventh worst in the world, behind only Belgium, the UK, Peru, Italy, Sweden, and Chile. At the rate we&#8217;re going, in a few weeks we&#8217;ll probably be the third worst country in the world. And that&#8217;s despite a huge and extremely competent health care system.</p>
<p>There was no good reason for this. Maybe we never had the self-discipline and patience to be Germany (109 deaths per million), but even moderately decent leadership could have cut our number in half and had us trending downward instead of heading back up.</p>
<p>Competence matters.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For space reasons in the chart, only every third country is labeled. I also deleted tiny statelets.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The original chart was too confusing. It now shows every country, not every third. The downside is that the type is teensy.</p>

<p id="p2">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a major change to its executive team today</a>: Phil Schiller, who first started at Apple in 1987, is transitioning into a limited role with far fewer responsibilities, holding the title Apple Fellow. Schiller will retain oversight of the App Store and Apple Events, and continue reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook, but most of his current responsibilities will shift to Greg (Joz) Joswiak, who takes over the title of senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.</p>
<p id="p3">Here&rsquo;s Schiller on this significant day of transition:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &ldquo;It has been a dream come true for me to work at Apple, on so many products I love, with all of these great friends &mdash; Steve, Tim, and so many more,&rdquo; said Schiller. &ldquo;I first started at Apple when I was 27, this year I turned 60 and it is time for some planned changes in my life. I&rsquo;ll keep working here as long as they will have me, I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Tim Cook remarks:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  &ldquo;Phil has helped make Apple the company it is today and his contributions are broad, vast, and run deep. In this new role he will continue to provide the incredible thought partnership, and guidance that have defined his decades at Apple&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Schiller has been one of the most visible members of Apple&rsquo;s team for a long time, most notably owning primary responsibility for introducing new hardware at Apple keynotes, such as the latest iPhone models each year. His expected absence from future such occasions will mark a stark shift for the company.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/B23B1602-D05B-4744-BE8A-D50AA1B8A904-1596561809760.jpeg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p9">Joswiak, who takes Schiller&rsquo;s former role, is no unfamiliar face himself. He has over two decades of leadership experience within Apple, and in recent years has become a regular presence at Apple events as well. Despite being a major force within the company, however, Joswiak&rsquo;s presence on the executive team represents a new level of leadership for him, and come with major new responsibilities.</p>
<p id="p10">After many years of stability at the highest levels of leadership, time is finally catching up with Apple&rsquo;s executive team. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/jony-ive-to-leave-apple-to-form-new-design-firm-and-sabih-kahn-named-svp-of-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">departed the company</a> last summer, just a few months after Angela Ahrendts <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-retail-chief-angela-ahrendts-leaving-company-replaced-by-deirdre-obrien/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vacated her role as SVP of Retail</a>. While today&rsquo;s news follows a different pattern, since Schiller is remaining with the company despite his reduced role, so much change at the top of the organization feels very new for the modern Apple era.</p>
<p id="p11">As someone who began following Apple closely only about a decade ago, not long before the passing of former presentation chief Steve Jobs, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Schiller product introductions and am really going to miss his presence for many keynotes to come.</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced that Phil Schiller will become an Apple
Fellow, continuing a storied career that began at Apple in 1987.
In this role, which reports to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Schiller will
continue to lead the App Store and Apple Events. Greg (Joz)

</blockquote>

<p>Schiller hasn’t just been at Apple a long time — he’s held the position atop product marketing for, well, as long as I can remember. Product development, advertising, packaging, messaging, comms, keynotes — you name it, if it was public-facing, Schiller has been in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Best way I can put it is that Schiller is the most Apple-y of all Apple executives.</p>

<p>Schiller will continue to maintain a presence at the company, overseeing the App Store and Apple Events, and will still report to Tim Cook in his new capacity. But this seems like a step back from his duties as product marketing chief, a sort of pseudo-retirement.</p>
<p>Succeeding Schiller in his role as product marketing chief is Greg “Joz” Jozwiak, another Apple veteran of more than two decades.</p><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/phil-schiller-advances-to-apple-fellow/">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/phil-schiller-is-now-an-apple-fellow-succeeded-by-joz/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly
disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list
of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks,
I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them,
counting down to number one.</p>

<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these
are my favorite Macs — a bunch of them I only knew in passing and
never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever — a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious
exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise
we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>

<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a
list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the
last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular,
revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I
have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/">Baseball 100
project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series
will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable
omissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was not just happy but downright delighted to speak with Jason about a few of these Macs. And, yes, I’m outraged over at least one omission.</p>

    <p>Jason Snell on today’s 27-inch iMac update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for the future, is this the last Intel Mac we’ll see? There’s
no way to tell, though reading between the lines, it wouldn’t be
surprising if there were some more Intel-based Mac releases as
Apple progresses through its two-year-long processor transition.
But I’d wager good money that the next time we see an iMac update,
there won’t be an Intel processor at its heart. And perhaps it
will look appreciably different, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a good bet to me that today’s update is the last round of Intel-based iMacs. What else might get an Intel speed bump before Apple Silicon-based Macs start debuting at the end of the year? Maybe the Mac Mini? Speed bumps for the Mac Pro and iMac Pro?</p>

    <p>Isabel Kershner and Pam Belluck, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Confident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a
devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire
student body back in late May.</p>

<p>Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school,
which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single
school in Israel, possibly the world. The virus rippled out to the
students’ homes and then to other schools and neighborhoods,
ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives.
Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close. Across the
country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were
quarantined.</p>

<p>Israel’s advice for other countries?</p>

<p>“They definitely should not do what we have done,” said Eli
Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and
chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council
on the pandemic. “It was a major failure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s Israel’s experience reopening schools <em>after</em> getting infections under control. Here in the U.S. COVID new infections <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">remain out of control <em>already</em></a>, with nearly all schools closed for summer.</p>

    <p>We all know that Donald Trump is an idiot, so I&#8217;ve mostly stopped highlighting the idiocy-of-the-day from the White House. By now, you&#8217;re either convinced or you aren&#8217;t. But every once in a while Trump turns in a performance so jaw dropping that I just have to pass it along. Here is Trump talking about COVID-19 deaths with <em>Axios</em> reporter Jonathan Swan:</p>

    <p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced a major update to its 27-inch iMac. By far
the most powerful and capable iMac ever, it features faster Intel
processors up to 10 cores, double the memory capacity,
next-generation AMD graphics, superfast SSDs across the line with
four times the storage capacity, a new nano-texture glass option
for an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a 1080p FaceTime HD
camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A summary of what’s new:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Intel CPUs and AMD graphic cards</li>
<li>SSDs across the line, including options for 4 TB and 8 TB</li>
<li>TrueTone</li>
<li>Nano-texture display finish, like the Pro Display XDR ($500)</li>
<li>RAM options up to 128 GB (base configuration is still 8 GB; the high-end 64 and 128 GB options cost $1,000 and $2,600, respectively)</li>
<li>1080p FaceTime camera with better low-light performance, and a “studio quality” microphone array like the current MacBook Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>The 21-inch iMac has not been updated, although the base model configurations now have SSDs instead of Fusion Drives. There remains a 1 TB Fusion Drive build-to-order configuration for the 21-inch iMac, which I believe is now the last spinning hard disk Apple sells.</p>

<p>The iMac Pro has not been updated either, although the $5,000 base model is now the 10-core Xeon W configuration, and the old 8-core base model is gone.</p>

<p id="p2">Today, Apple revealed an update to the 27-inch 5K Retina iMac with faster processors, updated graphics, more storage, and new display features. Although the new 27-inch iMac&rsquo;s design is identical to the existing model, this is still a significant update compared to the iMac it replaces.</p>
<p id="p3">According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &ldquo;Now more than ever, our customers are relying on the Mac. And many of them need the most powerful and capable iMac we&rsquo;ve ever made,&rdquo; said Tom Boger, Apple&rsquo;s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing. &ldquo;With blazing performance, double the memory, SSDs across the line with quadruple the storage, an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a better camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics, the 27-inch iMac is loaded with new features at the same price. It&rsquo;s the ultimate desktop, to work, create, and communicate.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Last updated in March 2019, the new iMac features 6 and 8-core 10th generation Intel CPUs that can reach speeds of up to 5.0GHz with Turbo Boost. Storage is all SSD now with transfer speeds up to 3.4GB/s when launching apps and large files. There&rsquo;s also an 8TB SSD option for the first time, which is four times the storage available in the previous model. Until today, the standard configurations of the 27-inch iMac came with Fusion drives.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/imac.jpg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p7">The new iMac has been upgraded to AMD Radeon Pro Series 5000 graphics. The display of the iMac is the same resolution as before, but now, it comes with a new nano-texture option first seen in the Pro Display XDR, which provides a low-reflection, matte finish, and it supports Apple&rsquo;s True Tone technology. The new all-in-one desktop also includes a T2 chip for boot and data security, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, and improved speakers and microphones.</p>
<p id="p8">Apple&rsquo;s other iMacs received smaller updates today too. SSDs are now standard in the 21.5-inch model, although a Fusion Drive is still an option. Also, a 10-core Intel Xeon processor is now standard in the iMac Pro.</p>
<p id="p9">Today&rsquo;s updates are in line with Apple&rsquo;s statements during WWDC that the company had additional updates to Macs based on Intel CPUs in the pipeline. Although Macs with ARM processors are on the way later this year, Apple has not revealed which models will be converted to ARM first. Consequently, if you need a new desktop Mac, it&rsquo;s still worth considering the Intel-based models, especially the new 27-inch iMac, which is substantially improved over its last iteration.</p>

<p>The only thing more predictable than members of Congress using hearings to make statements instead of ask questions, and when they do ask questions, usually of the &#8220;gotcha&#8221; variety, refusing to allow witnesses to answer (even as those witnesses seek to run out the clock), is people watching said hearings and griping about how worthless the whole exercise is.</p>
<p>There was, needless to say, all of the above last Wednesday, when the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held a hearing featuring Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. Statements were made, gotcha questions were asked, answers were interrupted, clocks were run out, and there was a whole lot of griping about what a waste of time it all was.</p>
<p>To be sure, it does seem like there must be a better way to hold these hearings, particularly if the goal is to learn something new, but the reality is that genuine inquiry is much more likely to happen without the glare of the media spotlight that inevitably accompanies such a high profile hearing; what that glare will highlight is the politics of the topic in question: what do various politicians and parties actually care about, what do they think that their constituents care about, and how should those affected by said hearings respond.</p>
<p>In that regard last Wednesday&#8217;s hearing was a success: partisan priorities were made clear on the politician side, tech&#8217;s collective position and impact on society came into view, even as each of the companies at the hearing revealed different strengths and vulnerabilities. This article will examine all of these points, but first a caveat: this post, even more than most on Stratechery, is meant as an analysis of the politics of this hearing in particular, not a statement of values; unless I say so explicitly, I am not necessarily endorsing or condemning any particular line of argument, simply pointing it out.</p>
<h4>The Political Effects of Monopoly</h4>
<p>Lina Khan, who rose to prominence with her 2017 law review article <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox</a>, and who served as counsel for the antitrust subcommittee over the course of the investigation that culminated in Wednesday&#8217;s hearings, summarized the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeclap/article/9/3/131/4915966">New Brandeis Movement</a> of antitrust in 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As the name suggests, this new movement traces its intellectual roots to Justice Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court between 1916 and 1939. Brandeis was a strong proponent of America’s Madisonian traditions—which aim at a democratic distribution of power and opportunity in the political economy. Early in the twentieth century, Brandeis successfully updated America’s antimonopoly regime, along Madisonian lines, for the industrial era, and his philosophy held sway well into the 1970s. As the ‘New Brandeis School&#8217; gains prominence — even prompting two floor speeches by Senator Orrin Hatch (a Republican from Utah) — it’s worth understanding what this vision of antimonopoly does and does not represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the article is worth reading in full, it is no accident that Khan started with &#8220;democracy&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Brandeis and many of his contemporaries feared that concentration of economic power aids the concentration of political power, and that such private power can itself undermine and overwhelm public government. Dominant corporations wield outsized influence over political processes and outcomes, be it through lobbying, financing elections, staffing government, funding research, or establishing systemic importance that they can leverage. They use these strategies to win favorable policies, further entrenching their dominance.</p>
<p>  Brandeis also believed that the structure of our markets and of our economy can determine how much real liberty individuals experiences in their daily lives. Most people’s day-to-day experience of power comes not from interacting with public officials, but through relationships in their economic lives — negotiating pay with an employer, for example, or wrangling the terms of business with a trading partner. Brandeis feared that autocratic structures in the commercial sphere — such as when one or a few private corporations call all the shots — can preclude the experience of liberty, threatening democracy in our civic sphere.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman David Cicilline, in the conclusion to his opening statement, made a clear gesture to the New Brandeis Movement:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_0_5163" id="identifier_0_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That is Khan sitting behind Cicilline">1</a></p>

<p>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&#038;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was notable to me is that in the hearing Cicilline and the other Democrats never really focused on this point; the rest of Cicilline&#8217;s opening statement, and much of the Democratic questioning, focused on what they perceived as illegal activities that caused economic harm, without necessarily tying that to political harm. Again, that&#8217;s not to say they were ignoring the linkage, but it wasn&#8217;t a priority.</p>
<p>What made this stand out was that Republicans were focused almost entirely on the politics of monopoly, specifically their contention that large platforms, particularly Google and Facebook (and Twitter), were censoring conservative viewpoints and working to elect Democratic candidates to office, particularly the presidency, and that this was a problem because of their dominance. Leave aside, if you can, your opinion about the veracity of these complaints (and remember my note at the beginning about focusing on analysis): while the Republicans were certainly not endorsing the &#8220;New Brandeis School&#8221; — Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner in particular took care to highlight support for the consumer welfare standard, also known as the &#8220;Chicago School&#8221; — their concern with the size of tech companies had nothing to do with economic effects and everything to do with political effects. It was a striking contrast.</p>
<h4>Begging the Question</h4>
<p>One of the more humorous lines of questioning, at least for language nerds, came courtesy of Republican Representative Matt Gaetz:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div id="v-OX8l0Ypj-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-OX8l0Ypj-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Matt Gaetz begging the question" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/OX8l0Ypj/gaetz-i-want-to-talk-about-search-1_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Matt Gaetz begging the question</p></video></div></div>
<p>I want to talk about Search because that’s an area where I know Google has real market dominance. On December 11th, you testified to the Judiciary Committee, and in response to a question from my colleague Zoe Lofgren about Search, you said, “We don’t manually intervene on any particular search result.” But leaked memos obtained by The Daily Caller show that that isn’t true. In fact, those memos were altered December 3rd, just a week before your testimony. And they describe a deceptive news blacklist and a process for developing that blacklist approved by Ben Gomes, who leads Search with your company. And also something called a fringe ranking, which seems to beg the question, who gets to decide what’s fringe?</p>
<p>And in your answer, you said to Ms. Lofgren that there is no manual intervention of search. That was your testimony, but … And now I’m going to cite specifically from this memo from The Daily Caller. It says that the … I’m sorry, that The Daily Caller obtained from your company. It says, “The beginning of the workflow starts when a website is placed on a watch list.” It continues, “This watch list is maintained and stored by Ares with access restricted to policy and enforcement specialists.” Sort of does beg the question who these enforcement specialists are?</p></blockquote>
<p>First off, note that this is an example of Republicans linking dominance to concerns about censorship. The point about language, though, is that Gaetz is using the phrase &#8220;begs the question&#8221; incorrectly; I know this, because I used to make the same mistake, until a reader graciously corrected me a couple of years ago. What Gaetz meant to say was &#8220;raises the question&#8221;; &#8220;begs the question&#8221;, on the other hand, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">Wikipedia&#8217;s definition</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  An informal fallacy that occurs when an argument&#8217;s premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of circular reasoning: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy&#8217;s presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For an example of this logical fallacy at work, look no further than this antitrust hearing, and Cicilline&#8217;s concluding statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div id="v-U2zVQGLL-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-U2zVQGLL-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Cicilline closing statement" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U2zVQGLL/cicilline-today-we-had-the-opportunity-to-hear_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Cicilline closing statement</p></video></div></div>
<p>Today, we had the opportunity to hear from the decision makers at four of the most powerful companies in the world. This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies, as exist today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I may nitpick, this is obviously not true — Cicilline had decided well before this hearing that these companies have monopoly power. The problem is that a huge number of questions in the hearing took it as a given that these companies were monopolies, and proceeded to find rather common business practices as being major crimes. In other words, they begged the question.</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples of this fallacy — where it is assumed that a company is a monopoly, and therefore its actions are illegal, and because its actions are illegal it is a monopoly — was this exchange between Representative Jamie Raskin and Bezos:</p>
<div align="center"><div id="v-jhRfu787-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-jhRfu787-1-video" width="640" height="360" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Raskin and Bezos" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/jhRfu787/raskin-bezos_dvd.original.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></div><p>Raskin and Bezos</p></video></div></div>
<p>Start with the HBO Max-on-Fire TV question. One of the first things you learn about conducting effective negotiations is that you want to negotiate about more things, not fewer. The reasoning is straightforward: if you are only negotiating about a single variable — in this example, Raskin believes that Amazon and HBO should <em>only</em> negotiate on price — the outcome is zero sum: every cent that Amazon wins is a cent that HBO loses. However, if you are able to introduce more variables, then you might find out that one company cares a lot about price, while the other company cares a lot about promotion (just to make up an example); in that case one company can get a better price and give up a lot of promotional opportunities, while the other can get a worse price and gain a lot of promotional opportunities, and thanks to their differing priorities, both feel like winners. That&#8217;s good negotiating!</p>
<p>It also appears to be, at least according to Raskin, illegal, because Amazon is &#8220;us[ing its] gatekeeper status role in the streaming device market to promote [its] position as a competitor in the video streaming market with respect to content.&#8221; That&#8217;s the problem though: there was zero evidence provided that Amazon has a monopolistic position in either streaming devices or video streaming; it was simply taken as fact, which made basic negotiating practices suspect, and evidence that Amazon was a monopoly. Begging the question.</p>
<p>Raskin&#8217;s question about Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Ring was an even better example of the fallacy at work; while I don&#8217;t really understand why multivariate negotiations would be illegal even if you are a monopoly, there are clear antitrust issues raised by a monopolist acquiring a company for market share. Crucially, though, acquiring a company for market share if you are <em>not</em> a monopolist is not a crime.</p>
<p>It follows, then, that if Amazon had a monopoly in the home automation market, and acquired Ring for market share reasons, that could very well be an antitrust violation, but if they weren&#8217;t a monopoly, it would not be. What is critical to note is that you have to establish that Amazon has a monopoly <em>first</em>; only then can you decide if the acquisition was anticompetitive. Raskin, though, begs the question: the fact that Amazon acquired Ring for market share reasons is taken as evidence that Amazon has a monopoly, which then makes the acquisition illegal.</p>
<p>The same problem applied to Raskin&#8217;s final two complaints: Alexa defaulting to Amazon Prime Music, and recommending Amazon Basics. Those may be a problem if you first establish that Amazon has a monopoly in the relevant product areas, but it is not itself evidence that Amazon is a monopoly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m focusing on this specific exchange, but the truth is that a combination of vilifying common business practices and <em>begging the question</em> was a consistent theme. Things like market research or copying competitor features or improving products were held up as obvious crimes and evidence of monopoly, when they were often not crimes at all, or only crimes if a monopoly in the relevant market had first been established. That is not to say that the committee&#8217;s investigation didn&#8217;t produce evidence of illegal anticompetitive actions, but rather that said evidence, such that there was, too often begged the question.</p>
<h4>The GOP Bargain</h4>
<p>The combination of the Republicans&#8217; focus on the political aspects of antitrust and the tendency of the Democrats to see antitrust crimes even in normal business proceedings produced what was, I think, the most obvious political takeaway for tech companies: the Democrats have made up their minds (that tech is guilty), while the Republicans are willing to cut a deal.</p>
<p>The outline of that deal could not have been more obvious: Republicans are fine with the consumer welfare standard (which, as I noted back in 2016, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/">inherently favors Aggregators</a>) and tech&#8217;s business practices, as long as tech companies don&#8217;t &#8220;censor&#8221;; the alternating format of Congressional hearings placed these demands in direct contrast to Democratic assumptions of guilt. To put it in explicit terms: &#8220;We, Republicans, are your friends in Washington, but if you want us to defend you from the Democrats, you need to stop censoring conservatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&#8217;t matter that conservative websites tend to do particularly well on social media, or that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">the destruction of the media business model helped lay the groundwork for President Trump&#8217;s rise</a>; Republicans expect that tech companies — by which they mostly mean Google and Facebook (and Twitter) — err on the side of not censoring or checking conservative content if they want help in Washington, because that help is not coming from the Democrats.</p>
<h4>Tech&#8217;s United Front</h4>
<p>Something that stood out from the four CEOs&#8217; <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/28/tech-ceo-antitrust-hearing-opening-statement-385233">opening statements</a>, and the general tenor of their defenses, was their insistence that they supported small-and-medium sized businesses.</p>

<p>20 years ago, we made the decision to invite other sellers to sell in our store, to share the same valuable real estate we’ve spent billions to build, market, and maintain. We believe that combining the strengths of Amazon Store with the vast selection of products offered by third parties would be a better experience for customers, and that the growing pie of revenue and profits would be big enough for all. We were betting that it was not a zero sum game. Fortunately, we were right. There are now, 1.7 million small-and-medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.</p></blockquote>

<p>One way we contribute is by building helpful products. Research found that free services like search, Gmail, maps, and photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. And many are small businesses using our digital tools to grow. Stone Dimensions, a family owned stone company in Pewaukee, Wisconsin uses Google My Business to draw more customers. Gil’s appliances, a family owned appliance store in Bristol, Rhode Island credits Google analytics with helping them reach customers online during the pandemic. Nearly one third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.</p></blockquote>

<p>What does motivate us is that timeless drive to build new things that we’re proud to show our users. We focus relentlessly on those innovations, on deepening core principles like privacy and security and on creating new features. In 2008, we introduced a new feature of the iPhone called the App Store launched with 500 apps, which seemed like a lot at the time, the App Store provided a safe and trusted way for users to get more out of their phone. We knew the distribution options for software developers at the time didn’t work well, brick-and-mortar stores charged high fees and have limited reach, physical media like CDs had to be shipped and were hard to update. From the beginning, the App Store was a revolutionary alternative. App Store developers set prices for their apps and never pay for shelf space.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_1_5163" id="identifier_1_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, Cook is pretending like the Internet never existed as a distribution channel">2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve built services that billions of people find useful. I’m proud that we’ve given people who’ve never had a voice before the opportunity to be heard, and given small businesses access to tools that only the largest players used to have.</p></blockquote>
<p>This shared focus was notable for two reasons, one specific to these hearings, and one that tells a broader story about how the Internet is changing the world.</p>
<p>First off, probably the most obvious connective thread in the hearing was concern about these companies creating platforms and then favoring themselves unfairly. Amazon, for example, is accused of using data about third party sellers to inform its private-label goods strategy (and data from AWS); Google is accused of using data about search to keep users on its pages; Apple is accused of using its control of the App Store to favor its own apps; and Facebook is accused of using data about app usage to drive its acquisition strategy. What each of these companies is arguing is that focusing on a couple of disgruntled companies is to miss the larger picture, wherein these companies created those opportunities in the first place, and for exponentially more companies than those the Committee may have heard from.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting, though, is that to the extent these companies are right it foretells both a new kind of economy and a new kind of political alignment. Zuckerberg&#8217;s summary was the shortest yet most explicit, perhaps because Facebook is the best example of this phenomenon; I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/">Apple and Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Internet is best illustrated by <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/">the smiling curve</a>, in which value flows to large Aggregators and Platforms on one side, and small businesses built with Internet assumptions about addressable markets (and Internet cost structures) on the other side, while the folks in the middle that built their businesses on owning distribution in a world of scarcity are increasingly obsolete.</p>

<p>That is why you regularly see strange political bedfellows, like Uber and drivers and riders versus taxi companies and politicians, or Airbnb and hosts versus hotels and, well, politicians, or these companies and their small business bases against newspapers, retailers, cross-platform software businesses, vertical aggregators and yes, politicians. Zuckerberg made this point on behalf of the tech industry as a whole:</p>

<p>We’re here to talk about online platforms, but I think the true nature of competition is much broader. When Google bought YouTube, they could compete against the dominant player in video, which was the cable industry. When Amazon bought Whole Foods, they could compete against Kroger’s and Walmart. When Facebook bought WhatsApp, we could compete against telcos who used to charge 10 cents a text message, but not anymore. Now people can watch video, get groceries delivered, and send private messages for free. That’s competition. New companies are created all the time, all over the world. And history shows that if we don’t keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies that used to be big, at least before the big tech companies came along, have the most to lose from tech, but just because they are ill-equipped to compete does not mean they are representative of all businesses, particularly companies that only exist because these platforms and Aggregators exist.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_2_5163" id="identifier_2_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again, this is not to say that regulation isn&rsquo;t necessary &mdash; see A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet ">3</a></p>
<h4>Tech&#8217;s Differing Prospects</h4>
<p>That noted, just because there were similarities in their messaging does not mean that each tech company has similar prospects as far as potential regulation is concerned. From the companies that should be the least concerned to the most:</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> It was obvious that the committee only invited Apple because they wanted to say that they invited all of the large consumer tech CEOs. The questions for Cook were hilariously uninformed about the App Store, making it easy for Apple&#8217;s CEO to run out the clock (often without any interruption). This was certainly disappointing given that many of Apple&#8217;s policies are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">clearly anticompetitive</a> (which, as I noted above, is different than being illegal), but for now the takeaway is that Congress doesn&#8217;t know and doesn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook was probably the biggest beneficiary of Democrats <em>not</em> focusing on political harm relative to economic harm; as I noted last year in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">Tech and Antitrust</a>, there really isn&#8217;t much about the company&#8217;s business practices (post acquisitions) that are anticompetitive. There was an interesting back-and-forth about Facebook&#8217;s discriminatory willingness to deal as far as access to their friend graph is concerned, but for that to be illegal you have to first establish that Facebook is a monopoly.</p>
<p>On this point I thought the Committee&#8217;s questioning was frequently unfair: the fact that social networks that existed when Facebook was founded no longer do (MySpace, Friendster, etc.) was taken as evidence that Facebook is a monopoly, with zero acknowledgment of the rise of Snapchat, TikTok, iMessage, etc. Similarly, Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Instagram was discussed as if it happened today, when Instagram has over a billion users, as opposed to 2012, when it had 30 million. To be sure, <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/189433922243919872">some</a> saw the anticompetitive angle of that purchase at the time, but many more mocked the price; at a minimum we can all agree that judging decisions made in 2012 according to the facts of 2020 isn&#8217;t necessarily just.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon seemed to attract the most in-depth scrutiny from the committee (perhaps because of Kahn), and while the biggest focus was on the 3rd-party marketplace and Amazon&#8217;s private-label strategy, there was a clear attempt across multiple questioners to make the case that Amazon creates &#8220;innovation kill zones&#8221;, as Representative Joe Neguse put it, across all of its product lines. There was clearly a target on Bezos.</p>
<p>At the same time, as Bezos regularly noted, it is not clear in what markets Amazon has a monopoly, and if it is not a monopoly, a lot of the behavior lawmakers were objecting to is not illegal (and, as I noted above, may not be illegal regardless). Bezos also made the point that only the military has a higher approval rating than Amazon, and when it comes to politics, that still matters.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> I think that Google is in trouble. The company received the second greatest amount of specificity in its questions as far as competition topics go — Representative Pramila Jayapal&#8217;s questions about ad exchanges was particularly well-done, especially given the constraints of the format — but more importantly, at least far as the politics of this hearing is concerned, was revealed to have no friends.</p>
<p>Specifically, the price of the company pulling out of Project Maven and the Pentagon&#8217;s JEDI project because of concerns about collaborating with the U.S. military<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/#footnote_3_5163" id="identifier_3_5163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally, I think the real reason that Google pulled out of the JEDI project is that Google Cloud was not competitive with Azure and AWS; citing ethical concerns was a misguided attempt to claim a strategy credit that is coming back to bite the company in a major way">4</a> is that the GOP deal I detailed above is not on the table: Republicans pushed Pichai on not just censorship and election interference but also its refusal to support the military repeatedly, and it seems clear than if and when an antitrust case is brought against the company, it will have few defenders. That is a particularly big problem for Google because <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">the antitrust case against the company is by far the most straightforward</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">last week before the hearing</a>, I am glad that it occurred. Figuring out how to regulate tech companies — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">particularly Aggregators</a>, that base their power on consumer welfare — will require new approaches, and probably new laws. Moreover, any such regulations will necessitate difficult trade-offs between competition, privacy, national security, etc. (I was grateful that Representative Kelly Armstrong highlighted how GDPR made big tech companies stronger), which again means that Congress is best situated to decide what tradeoffs we should make.</p>
<p>To that end, I think the hearing was more successful than the format made it seem: there is more clarity about both Democratic and Republican priorities, as well as potential new divisions driven by technology generally, and a finer-grained understanding of how individual companies raise different concerns specifically. No, this wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&#8221;, but then again that movie was made by a studio about to be convicted of acting anti-competitively.</p>

    <p>Today, Apple has updated the iMac. While the design remains the same, it&#8217;s a meaningful update here in the twilight of the Intel era.</p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple_imac-magickeyboardnum-magicmouse2-macos-wallpaper_08042020_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="iMac with 5K Retina display" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/">Here&#8217;s Apple:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Now more than ever, our customers are relying on the Mac. And many of them need the most powerful and capable iMac we’ve ever made,” said Tom Boger, Apple’s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing. “With blazing performance, double the memory, SSDs across the line with quadruple the storage, an even more stunning Retina 5K display, a better camera, higher fidelity speakers, and studio-quality mics, the 27-inch iMac is loaded with new features at the same price. It’s the ultimate desktop, to work, create, and communicate.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the case is the same, Apple has brought the Pro Display XDR&#8217;s nano-texture option to the iMac for the first time. Like on the XDR, it will set you back a pretty penny: $500 to be exact.</p>
<p>In more reasonable news, the iMac now supports TrueTone. Above the display is a 1080p webcam, an upgrade from the previous models.</p>
<p>On the spec end of things, the 27-inch iMac now uses 10th-gen Intel CPUs across the board, and includes faster AMD GPUs, providing twice the video memory as in previous models.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the new machine can be ordered with 10 Gigabit Ethernet and up to 128 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>If it sounds like the iMac is creeping up toward the iMac Pro, it&#8217;s because it is. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/last-hurrah-imacs-get-intel-processor-upgrade-all-ssd-storage-t2-chip/">Here&#8217;s a bit from Jason Snell&#8217;s report:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Last year’s iMacs already pushed up against the performance of the iMac Pro, and these will undoubtedly beat it—especially that 10-core model. In an acknowledgement of this, Apple has rejiggered the iMac Pro line, dropping the old base eight-core model and moving the 10-core model to the base price. So now the iMac line ends at 10 cores and the iMac Pro line begins there.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the storage front, Apple was quick to note the inclusion of SSDs in all standard configurations of the 5K iMac, and that&#8217;s true, but the base models come with a measly 256 GB of storage.<sup id="fnref-19958-fn-t2"><a href="http://512pixels.net#fn-19958-fn-t2" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> This may be a roadblock for some users, so the Fusion Drive is still an option on the 21.5-inch models.</p>
<p>Speaking of that other iMac, it didn&#8217;t get much love today past the storage story.</p>
<p>The 21.5-inch iMac is still using older 7th- and 8th-gen Intel processors, but every base model comes equipped with SSDs. That&#8217;s about it in terms of updates for the smaller of the two models. The $1,099 model even still comes with a 1920&#215;1080 display.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn-19958-fn-t2">
This also means Apple&#8217;s T2 security chip is present on the new iMacs, a first for the line. And just because I couldn&#8217;t find a good place for it, the new iMacs include a fancy new microphone system, but still come with the previous set of speakers, which were already pretty dang good.&#160;<a href="http://512pixels.net#fnref-19958-fn-t2">&#8617;</a>

It must be rapidly filling with Macs with Apple silicon, but on Tuesday that pipeline <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/">disgorged a new Intel-based 27-inch iMac</a> with a bunch of technical improvements, while retaining the prices of previous models.</p>
<p>For those expecting a redesign to the exterior of the iMac, which has been largely unchanged for many years now, it’s clear that any major rethinking of Apple’s venerable all-in-one is going to have to wait for the Apple silicon era. Apple’s not doing what it did with the iMac back during the last processor transition and redesigning the exterior just <em>before</em> swapping chips, and future Mac historians will be thankful for that.</p>
<p><span id="more-12574"></span></p>
<p>The biggest external change to the iMac this time around is an optional one: You can order one with the same glare-killing “nanotexture” glass texture as on Apple’s Pro Display XDR, for an additional $500. If you live in a very bright environment and the glare is making you sad, this upgrade might be worth it. Regardless of which texture, though, the iMac display also now supports TrueTone.</p>
<p>Moving to the inside, the iMac has gotten a lot of big improvements over <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/04/2019-imac-review/">the versions that it released in March 2019</a>. The new 27-inch iMac is powered by 10th-generation Intel processors, and for the first time, there’s a 10-core i9 option. Graphics are powered by 7nm AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs, including a configure-to-order version with 16GB of VRAM for the first time on the 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>(Last year’s iMacs already pushed up against the performance of the iMac Pro, and these will undoubtedly beat it—especially that 10-core model. In an acknowledgement of this, Apple has rejiggered the iMac Pro line, dropping the old base eight-core model and moving the 10-core model to the base price. So now the iMac line ends at 10 cores and the iMac Pro line begins there.)</p>
<p>But this is more than just a processor bump, because Apple made a bunch of upgrades to other aspects of the iMac subsystem. The biggest news is that SSD storage is now standard across the entire iMac line (with options up to 8TB), where previously Apple made Fusion Drive (which is a small SSD coupled with a spinning hard drive) the standard. This is a long-overdue move, but I’m glad that Apple has finally made it. All iMac users deserve the speed of SSD storage.</p>
<p>However, there are a few wrinkles: The base storage level starts at 256GB, which is not a lot of storage. It might be plenty for some use cases, but other users will run into that limitation awfully quickly, especially if they’re storing a bunch of family photos locally in a Photos library. That’s why Apple is still offering a 1TB Fusion Drive as a configurable option on the 21.5-inch model, for no added cost. So while we can’t definitively say that the spinning hard drive has finally been pushed out of all Mac hardware, it’s gone from all the default configurations, at least.</p>
<p>Memory capacity has been doubled on the 27-inch iMac, so it now supports up to 128GB of DRAM. And the iMac has become the last Mac to receive a T2 security chip, which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2018/01/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution/">enables all sorts of features</a> previously unavailable on the iMac. That includes automatic disk encryption and security features, yes. But it also means improved image quality from the iMac’s camera, which has been upgraded to 1080p resolution. The T2 also provides improved audio processing, which should improve the sound of the (otherwise unchanged) iMac speakers.</p>
<p>As it did last year <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/macbook-pro-16/">with the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, Apple has upgraded the microphone system on the 27-inch iMac. There are two microphones on the iMac’s chin, and another on the back, and they work together to cancel out echo and noise and create what Apple calls a “studio quality” experience. My experience with the MacBook Pro’s microphone system was positive, but with caveats depending on how you positioned the laptop. I would imagine that the iMac, as a much more stationary device, will generate a more consistent sound—and the people on the other end of teleconferences will appreciate the added clarity.</p>
<p>The new iMac is available to order as of now and will ship later this week.</p>
<p>As for the future, is this the last Intel Mac we’ll see? There’s no way to tell, though reading between the lines, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were some more Intel-based Mac releases as Apple progresses through its two-year-long processor transition. But I’d wager good money that the next time we see an iMac update, there won’t be an Intel processor at its heart. And perhaps it will look appreciably different, too.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, here’s a fast new Intel iMac with upgraded internals and no more spinning-disk storage. It’s not the <em>giant</em> step forward that seems inevitable—but it’s a step forward all the same.</p>

    <p class="">I have been thinking about how the coronavirus pandemic has changed my life. There are lots of big and small ways. Have you thought about how the pandemic has changed time for you?<br><br>There were things you used to spend your time on, but where are you now saving time? That long commute is on hiatus. The drop-in visitors to your office to “shoot the breeze” is much less likely. If you think about it, there are lots of ways you may be saving time now that you weren’t before.<br><br>On the flip side, what are the new time sucks in your life? These days “Zoom Meeting” is becoming just as dirty of a phrase as “Powerpoint Presentation” was before all this madness started.&nbsp;<br><br>Everyone has their own accounting of time gained and time lost over the past several months, but if you’re not aware of your own, you should be. A half-hour commute to work equates to five found hours per week, 20 hours per month, 240 hours over a year. That’s six weeks in your pocket. You could do a lot with that time. The question is whether you will recognize you have it and what you will do with it.</p>

    <p>Very cool look at the “user experience” of LEGO computer blocks that we’ve probably all seen since time immemorial. Design engineer George Cave runs down <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/">the various types of interface design used in the LEGO blocks</a> and how they relate to real world UX:</p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/peeler.jpg" /></p><p>As a kid, it was my job to peel mountains of potatoes to feed our large family. I hated it. The potato peelers were all dull and some were rusty. They were wobbly and more likely to peel a finger than a potato.</p>
<p>These days I kind of enjoy peeling potatoes, thanks to my <a href="https://geni.us/kuhn-rikon">Kuhn Rikon Original Swiss Peeler</a>. This peeler will save you a lot of time and skinned fingers.</p>
<p>The super-sharp carbon steel blade is capable of peeling pretty much any vegetable or fruit, even tough-skinned customers like butternut squash. It peels smoothly and evenly, taking off just the right amount of skin so you lose a minimal amount of the inner flesh of the vegetable or fruit. I’ve had the peeler for about nine months and it’s still as sharp as it was when I bought it.</p>
<p>As a left-handed person, I appreciate that this peeler can be used in either hand. It also has a convenient potato eye remover.</p>
<p>I love this potato peeler so much I bought a 3-pack for my mom for Christmas. Cheap gift? Maybe. But at least now I won’t have to use her rusty, dull peelers when I visit.</p>

        • by John
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Let&#8217;s look at the continued fraction representation for √14.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/continued_fraction_sqrt_14.png" alt="\sqrt{14} = 3 + \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{2+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{6+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{2+ \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{6+ \ddots}}}}}}}}" width="372" height="239" /></p>
<p>If we were to take more terms, the sequence of denominators would repeat:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, …</p>
<p>We could confirm this with Mathematica:</p>
<pre>    
    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[14], 13]
    Out: {3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6}
</pre>
<p>For any integer <em>d</em> that is not a perfect square, the continued fraction for √<em>d</em> has a pattern that we see above.</p>
<ol>
<li>The coefficients after the first one are periodic.</li>
<li>The cycle consists of a <abbr title="A sequence that remains the same when reversed">palindrome</abbr> followed by a single number.</li>
<li>The last number in the cycle is twice the leading coefficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the example above, the periodic part is {1, 2, 1, 6}. The palindrome is {1, 2, 1} and 6 is twice the initial coefficient 3.</p>
<p>Another way to state the third point above is to say that the leading coefficient is the integer part of the square root of <em>d</em>, i.e. ⌊√<em>d</em>⌋, and the last coefficient in each period is 2⌊√<em>d</em>⌋.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/annotated_continued_fraction_sqrt_14.png" alt="Annotated version of continued fraction for sqrt(14)" width="470" height="300" /></p>
<p>Sometimes the palindrome is empty:</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[5], 10]
    Out: {2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4}
</pre>
<p>In the continued fraction for √5 the palindrome part is empty and we repeat 4, twice the initial coefficient.</p>
<p>For √3, the palindrome is simply {1} and the final number is 2.</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[3], 13]
    Out: {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}
</pre>
<p>One last example:</p>
<pre>    In:  ContinuedFraction[Sqrt[71], 17]
    Out: {8, 2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 2, 16, 2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 2, 16}
</pre>

    <p>Liza Lin, Jing Yang, and Eva Xiao, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump’s remark over the weekend that he was weighing an
outright ban of TikTok in the U.S. sparked nationalist sentiments
in China, where the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid,
derided the situation as “the hunting and looting of TikTok by the
U.S. government in conjunction with U.S. high-tech companies.”</p>

<p>On Chinese social media, users likewise expressed outrage. Many on
the Twitter -like Weibo platform accused the Trump administration
of pandering to voters by stemming the rise of TikTok — and by
extension, China.</p>

<p>On Douyin, Bytedance’s domestic analogue to TikTok, where videos
commenting on a possible U.S. ban circulated widely, one popular
comment suggested Huawei be allowed to buy Apple Inc.’s China
operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Be allowed to buy” is some euphemism for a forced sale. But if China decides to retaliate — and why wouldn’t they? — what company might they target other than Apple? Facebook and Google are already banned in China. Amazon has AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">which has a fair-sized presence there</a>, but AWS is sort of the anti-TikTok in terms of being consumer-facing. Microsoft would be the obvious tit-for-tat target. But does Microsoft have a neatly bundled consumer presence in China?</p>

<p>If I were the dictator of China, and I was angry about the Trump administration forcing a proud Chinese company like ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok, and I was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-china-idUSKCN25002I">looking for a way to show that China cannot be pushed around</a> by the U.S., I’d look at iCloud and the App Store, and humiliating the biggest company in the world.</p>

<p>But AAPL shares are trading at an all-time high so I’m sure all is good and Apple has nothing to worry about with a rapidly escalating trade war with China and a cornered-rat deranged narcissist steering the U.S.</p>

    <p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A transaction of the type the president envisions could also prove
more expensive than the one Microsoft described on Sunday. Trump
said Monday that part of the amount paid to buy TikTok would have
to come to the U.S. Treasury Department because it would be making
the deal possible.</p>

<p>“It’s a little bit like the landlord/tenant; without a lease the
tenant has nothing, so they pay what’s called ‘key money,’ or they
pay something,” Trump said. “But the United States should be
reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money,
because without the United States they don’t have anything, at
least having to do with the 30%.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve never heard of “key money”? Me neither, before today. But Trump would know it because it’s a term from crooked New York real estate deals. <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2015/11/what_is_key_money">Here’s a 2015 story on “key money” by Virginia K. Smith for the New York real estate site Brick Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Key money is when you pay a landlord money (usually under the
table) to secure an apartment,” says renters rights attorney Sam
Himmelstein, who notes that sometimes, it was supers, building
managers, or even the tenants themselves who demanded the cash.
The practice, unsurprisingly, is illegal — only licensed real
estate brokers are allowed to collect commission for an apartment — and has largely fallen by the wayside in recent years. “I
haven’t seen it in years,” says Himmelstein, “and most people
don’t report it unless they get into a scrape with their
landlords.”</p>

<p>But why even agree to this kind of bribe in the first place?
Essentially, key money served as a payoff for a lease that held
particular value, like that of a rent-stabilized apartment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s how crooked this piece of shit Trump is — he just uses lingo that’s synonymous with illegal kickbacks <em>with no shame</em>.</p>

    <p>Current Affairs editor Nathan J. Robinson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. It costs
money to produce good writing, to run a website, to license
photographs. A <em>lot</em> of money, if you want quality. Asking people
for a fee to access content is therefore very reasonable. You
don’t expect to get a print subscription to the newspaper
<em>gratis</em>, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble
about having to pay for online content, because I run a magazine
and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.</p>

<p>But let us also notice something: the New York Times, the New
Yorker, the Washington Post, the New Republic, New York, Harper’s,
the New York Review of Books, the Financial Times, and the London
Times all have paywalls. Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Wire, the
Federalist, the Washington Examiner, InfoWars: free! You want
“<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/01/portland-protesters-burn-bibles-american-flags-in-the-streets/">Portland Protesters Burn Bibles, American Flags In The

COVID Restrictions</a>,” or an article <a href="https://www.infowars.com/nih-admits-5g-can-actually-create-coronavirus-within-human-cells/">suggesting the National
Institutes of Health has admitted 5G phones cause coronavirus</a> — they’re yours. You want the detailed Times reports on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/europe/germany-nazi-infiltration.html">neo-Nazis infiltrating German institutions</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html">reasons

administration’s undercutting of the USPS’s effectiveness</a> — well, if you’ve clicked around the website a bit you’ll run
straight into the paywall. This doesn’t mean the paywall shouldn’t
be there. But it does mean that it costs time and money to access
a lot of true and important information, while a lot of bullshit
is completely free.</p>

    <p>Om Malik:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Why not someone like Disney which has dreams of being part of the
digital revolution? Disney has the audience. It has sprawling
global operations. It has the ability to walk the middle of the
road where it can appease the autocratic governments and make the
democratic countries satisfied. It also has a brand that has many
sub-brands that cross many demographic categories. Disney wanted
to buy Twitter. TikTok makes more of a strategic fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Comcast?</p></li>
<li><p>Why not Apple? It has money. It has the desire to blunt Facebook
and Google, even if it hasn’t said or done so explicitly! Or is it
because they are a bunch of hard asses when it comes to privacy
and may not play ball with the US government when it needs to
access data of some TikTok-er?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence my question, why Microsoft?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d be shocked if Apple got involved. Just isn’t their bag. But why is there no bidding war for TikTok? In addition to the baldfaced crookedness of Trump demanding and Microsoft offering a “key money” kickback to the U.S. Treasury, the other crooked angle in this claptrap saga is the fact that an acquisition of TikTok, partial or otherwise, is presented as an offer to Microsoft, not a company up for bid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I ask these questions but can’t help myself and not think about
the event of last week?</p>

<p>Why was Microsoft not part of the showdown between BigTech and
Washington DC? What makes them better than the other four? Why do
they get to be excused from on-air humiliation while others get
spanked for their monopolies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft’s absence from last week’s hearing was conspicuously odd then; <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/3/21353079/trump-tiktok-microsoft-antitrust-big-tech-china">now it’s glaring</a>. Especially when “buying upstart competitors” was one of the main thrusts of the whole thing.</p>

    <p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple rode the company’s strong earnings report to become the
world’s most valuable publicly traded company, surpassing the
state oil giant Saudi Aramco at Friday’s market close.</p>

<p>Apple shares closed up 10.47% Friday, giving it a market valuation
of $1.84 trillion. Saudi Aramco, which had been the most valuable
publicly listed company since its market debut last year, now
trails at $1.76 trillion as of its last close.</p>

<p>If you’re a newish user — say from the last decade — this surely feels different than if you’re a long-time Mac user. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/">Bill Gates “rescuing” Apple with a $150 million investment from Microsoft</a> (the symbolism of which, along with the commitment to continue developing Office for Mac, was far more important than the money itself), Wired magazine (when Wired magazine was truly great) <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gocarlo/12568034114">running the “Pray” cover</a> (when Apple was truly at risk), <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/463947/today-in-apple-history-sun-microsystems-almost-buys-apple/">Sun Microsystems negotiating to acquire Apple for just under $4 billion in early 1996</a> (truly the nearest Apple ever came to death).</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of Apple’s stock, this is welcome news. If you’re a fan of Apple’s products, this is profoundly worrisome. How does a company this large, this successful, <em>not</em> succumb to hubris? How does Apple keep the edge of an upstart? I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’m just pointing out the obvious: the difficult part of Tim Cook’s era as CEO is really only beginning.</p>

    <p>MG Siegler, on Microsoft’s — strange, to say the least — <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/">blog post announcing its interest in TikTok</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just read the thing. It’s almost like a letter of fealty. It
reads like something a Chinese company might write under the
Chinese government. To that end, it reads as if it was written at
the <em>behest</em> of the government. Maybe that’s too strong. <em>Maybe</em>?
How about: “Hey Satya, great conversation today. It sure would be
nice if you could outline what we discussed publicly.” That kind
of thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the
President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject
to a complete security review and providing proper economic
benefits to the United States, including the United States
Treasury.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an actual paragraph in the post. The second paragraph, no
less. What on Earth?! Is Treasury getting a finder’s fee here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought Tim Cook’s participation in Ivanka Trump’s “just find something new” Zoom panel <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/15/find-something-new-my-ass">was a bad look</a>. This is something else.</p>

    <p>A new study says that dementia has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/alzheimers-dementia-rates.html">on the wane for multiple decades:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risk for a person to develop dementia over a lifetime is now <strong>13 percent lower than it was in 2010.</strong> Incidence rates at every age have steadily declined over the past quarter-century&#8230;.<strong>In 1995, a 75-year-old man had about a 25 percent chance of developing dementia in his remaining lifetime. Now that man’s chance declined to 18 percent,</strong> said Dr. Albert Hofman, chairman of the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the new paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.osu.edu/baby-boomers-show-concerning-decline-in-cognitive-functioning/">But wait:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a reversal of trends, <strong>American baby boomers scored lower on a test of cognitive functioning than did members of previous generations,</strong> according to a new nationwide study.</p>
<p>Findings showed that average cognition scores of adults aged 50 and older increased from generation to generation, beginning with the greatest generation (born 1890-1923) and peaking among war babies (born 1942-1947). Scores began to decline in the early baby boomers (born 1948-1953) and decreased further in the mid baby boomers (born 1954-1959).<br />
<strong>While the prevalence of dementia has declined recently in the United States, these results suggest those trends may reverse in the coming decades,</strong> according to study author Hui Zheng, professor of sociology at The Ohio State University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust the boomers to screw things up. On the other hand, this might be the result of juvenile lead poisoning, and <em>that&#8217;s</em> the fault of the Greatest Generation. Greatest indeed.</p>
