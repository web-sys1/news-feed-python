    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">A few big scoops from Mark Gurman yesterday</a> that got lost in the shuffle a bit after Epic went to war against the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino,
California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early
as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said. […]</p>

<p>There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package
will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive
variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming
service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier
bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Apple One” passes the sniff test as a credible name for the bundle. But this description, if accurate, seems contrary to the spirit of the name. It’s not just <em>one</em> bundle, which to me is what Apple ought to offer. What Gurman describes is a frustrating jumble of à la carte offerings that seems no different than the current situation, where every Apple subscription offering is a standalone service, other than some sort of discount for subscribing to more than one service, but only if you subscribe to them in certain predefined tiers.</p>

<p>What Gurman is describing would offer nothing, for example, if you want Apple Music/TV+ and additional iCloud storage but have no interest in Arcade or News+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company is also developing a new subscription for virtual
fitness classes that can be used via an app for the iPhone, iPad
and Apple TV, the people said. That service will be offered in a
higher-end bundle with the rest of Apple’s services. Codenamed
“Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered
by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.,
according to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Total scoop for Gurman here if this pans out — this is the first anyone has reported this, I believe. This service simultaneously seems like a very keen offering from a company that is focused more and more on health and fitness features across its platforms (especially Watch) <em>and</em> more fuel to the fire that Apple unfairly competes against popular services from third parties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will
work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as
many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to
save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the
package chosen. For example, if a family subscribes today to all
of Apple’s major services plus the highest iCloud storage tier,
that would cost about $45 a month. A new bundle could knock more
than $5 off that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not much of a discount. To me the whole point of a bundle should be twofold: a greatly simplified offering (“<em>Just buy Apple One and get it all</em>”) at a <em>very</em> compelling price (“<em>Even if you don’t think you care about, say, Arcade and News+, hey, you’re effectively getting them for free</em>”.)</p>

<p>That’s the secret sauce to Amazon Prime. It’s a simple decision — get Prime or don’t — at a compelling price that makes everything other than the free shipping on Amazon purchases feel “free”.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1293892274875768832">Peter Kafka, on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long-awaited/predicted Apple bundles, coming this fall. The
problem: Bundles work when they include the thing people
love/want/need — sports for cable tv, free delivery for Amazon.
These bundles — per Bloomberg, are made up of Apple’s side gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great bundle offering does have a lynchpin. And while Prime and cable TV are good examples of that, they’re at extremes pricing-wise. Prime makes it feel like a good deal for shipping and everything else is free; cable TV makes it feel like you’re paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels you never watch just to get the ones you do (sports or otherwise).</p>

<p>So let’s think this through and figure out what Apple One “should” include and cost.</p>

<p>The big difference with Apple’s services is that everything is a standalone service, with reasonable à la carte pricing. Arcade and TV+ are just $5/month, including automatic family sharing. News+ is $10/month, including sharing. Music is $10 individually, and $15/month for a family sharing account. Music and News+ cost more (and Music, alone among Apple’s content offerings, charges extra for family sharing) because Apple doesn’t own the content.</p>

<p>Then there’s iCloud, the paid storage tiers for which haven’t changed in years. Right now in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 GB: $1/mo</li>
<li>200 GB: $3/mo</li>
<li>2 TB: $10/mo</li>
</ul>

<p>My back-of-the-envelope proposal is that Apple One should cost $15/month for an individual and $20/month for family sharing, and include: Music, TV+, Arcade, and the top tier of iCloud storage. Make News+ a $5/add-on.</p>

<p>Basically: start with Apple Music as the lynchpin service in the bundle, charge $5 more than they currently are for Music alone, and include everything Apple owns the entirety of: TV+, Arcade, and iCloud storage. I think they have to charge extra for News+ to pay the participating providers — News+ is more like a bundle unto itself. And that still leaves <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209670">TV Channels</a> as extra monthly add-ons, too. What Gurman describes sounds basically like “<em>Pay for a bunch of services on top of Apple Music, get one of them free</em>”; what I’m suggesting is more “<em>Pay for one additional service on top of Apple Music, get the rest free</em>”.</p>

<p>That would make for a simple proposition at a compelling price.</p>

    <p>Gabriel Sherman, reporting for Vanity Fair:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump didn’t expect Joe Biden to pick Kamala Harris as his
running mate. “He thought Biden would choose Karen Bass,” a
Republican briefed on Trump’s thinking said. Trump’s view,
according to sources close to the White House, was that Biden
would prefer a candidate with Bass’s low national profile and one
who wouldn’t outshine him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-surprised-biden-picked-kamala-221239304.html">Trump himself publicly admitted to being surprised</a> Biden chose Harris, on the grounds that she challenged Biden vigorously when she was competing against him for the nomination. Some leaders surround themselves with yes-men who will only tell them what they want to hear. Others surround themselves with independent thinkers who will offer their unvarnished opinion and advice. Trump should be pictured in the dictionary next to the entry for <em>projection</em>, so of course he expected Biden to choose how he himself chose.</p>

<p>Rightfully so, many are pointing to Biden’s choice, and Trump’s professed surprise at that choice, as clear indications of the profound temperamental differences between them.</p>

<p>I would just like to point out what this must be like to observe if you’re Mike Pence, knowing that Trump chose you because he thinks you’re a low-watt bulb with as much flavor as a chewed up piece of gum.</p>

Upon further investigation, we discovered that a developer&rsquo;s Xcode project at large contained the source malware, which leads to a rabbit hole of malicious payloads. Most notable in our investigation is the discovery of two zero-day exploits: one is used to steal cookies via a flaw in the behavior of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/security/sece3bee0835/web">Data Vaults</a>, another is used to abuse the development version of Safari.</p><p>This scenario is quite unusual; in this case, malicious code is injected into local Xcode projects so that when the project is built, the malicious code is run. This poses a risk for Xcode developers in particular. The threat escalates since we have identified affected developers who shared their projects on GitHub, leading to a supply-chain-like attack for users who rely on these repositories as dependencies in their own projects. We have also identified this threat in sources such as VirusTotal, which indicates this threat is at large.</p><p>This blog will summarize the findings of this threat, while its <a href="https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/XCSSET_Technical_Brief.pdf">accompanying technical brief</a> contains the full details of this attack.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://tidbits.com/2020/08/13/developers-v-apple-outlining-complaints-about-the-app-store/">
<p>At this critical juncture for the company, we wanted to take the opportunity to analyze the complaints against Apple regarding how it runs the App Store. We&rsquo;ve spent a long time observing and considering these issues, and you may agree or disagree with our evaluation and conclusions. As we are neither regulators nor Apple executives, the decisions are ultimately not up to us. We merely want to lay out the issues and offer suggestions on how Apple can improve, for the sake of users, developers, and even the long-term viability of the company itself.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The most likely path forward is for Apple to do nothing different until forced to change by a regulatory body. I say this is the most likely, because, from Apple&rsquo;s statements, the company seems to think it has nothing to apologize for and feels that it is doing the world a favor in the way it&rsquo;s running the App Store.</p>
<p>However, I think this would be a mistake that both the company and its fans would eventually regret.</p>

  <p>In late June, Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump “wants to
cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in
ballots.” At the time, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/biden-floats-baseless-election-conspiracy/">we wrote</a> that the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee had no evidence of Trump’s ulterior motive — but now he does.</p>

<p>In an Aug. 13 interview, Trump admitted that he opposes a
coronavirus pandemic relief bill crafted by the House Democrats
because it includes funding the U.S. Postal Service and state
election officials — funding that Trump said is needed to allow
the Postal Service to handle an expected surge in mail-in voting.</p>

<p>In 1876, seventeen year old Arthur Conan Doyle began his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh or, another way of putting it, he began to see the world in which Sherlock Holmes would begin his career. In Doyle&#39;s imagination, Holmes&#39; London must have looked a lot like the Edinburgh he knew as a student...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dawn mists rose from the valley until they dwindled to a plume above Edinburgh Castle. Perched on a craggy basalt cliff, the castle rose several stories from the summit,which towered four hundred feet above the base. On the inland side rose a turret from whose crown of lancet windows archers had rain arrows upon besieging armies since the twelfth century.</p>
<p>The castle was so high that its time gun could be heard far in every direction. This civil reminder had been fired at one p.m. every day but one since early 1861, before [Doyle turned two], alerting Leith ship captains and New Town shop owners to set their clocks, while every man on Princes Street reached for a waistcoat pocket to check his watch. The sound carried so far from the castle that its instigator...Scotland’s Astronomer Royal...prepared a concentric map showing the number of seconds it took the gun’s boom to reach each distance, for even more accurate time keeping.</p>
<p>...The castle stood so high that shepherds in Fife could turn from shearing to glimpse it like a mirage on the horizon. Mariners sailing in from the northeast could peer up at its battlements long before they reached the shore. It provided an unparalleled view of the region---northward to the jagged peaks of the Grampians, eastward across a thousand diary rooftops toward the storied height of Arthur’s Seat, southward to the Pentlands…</p>

<p>The castle cast its royal shadow across a bustling market down in the city. The drum and bugle accompanying the changing of the guard could be heard above the clatter of carriage wheels, the rumble of passing trains. Dense with public houses and shops, bristling with turnpike stairs and crow stepped gables, the Grassmarket had been a public site since the fifteenth century. In [Doyle’s] time it was still renowned for its cattle and horse trading. The venerable White Hart Inn was there, and the Black Bull, with its marble relief columns framing the entrance, and above them the words SPIRIT J. WILKINSON MERCHANT. Next door stood the Carriers Warehouse, where one horse wagons clustered out front, piled with goods covered in tightly stretched tarpaulins against the frequent rain. To proclaim that their wares had traveled from exotic climes, the Tobacco &amp; Snuff Manufactury featured above its sign a bust of a turbaned man, perhaps formerly a figurehead on a ship’s prow. Beneath it, wagons uncoupled from their horses projected handy rails on which loungers could lean to smoke and gossip…</p>
<p>Clustered below and east of the castle, the dark streets of Old Town sprawled in medieval disarray---poorly bracketed upper stories bulging above greasy streets so narrow that a man walking could stretch out his arms and touch a grimy wall on either side. Once Edinbugh’s tall buildings had housed aristocracy, until crowding and plague had driven them to the suburbs. By the 1870s, however, soot-flecked washing fluttered on clothes poles jutting from the windows of once proud houses that bore above their door a scutcheon with a tarnished coat of arms. The view from many windows was a dreary prospect of slate roofs topped with red chimneys, spoutin eye-smarting clouds of smoke---with now and then the rooftop scrabble of a blackened urchin sweeping a chimney. Not surprisingly, the city had held on to its Middle Scots nickname, “Auld Reekie” (Old Smokey). Not only the smoke stank. So did the foul breath of the tanners and glue factories, and the effluvia from chamber pots emptied into street carts or into the streets themselve. At least the winds that buffeted the high elevation helped to dispel the stench…</p>

<p>[By the time Doyle started his studies at the university], many hovels and tenements [had been] torn down and replaced with safer and cleaner modern housing. Poverty and crowding still defined the Old Town [but]...</p>
<p>He could stand high on the wind-plagued North Bridge, which joined Old Town to the cleaner streets neo-classical buildings of New Town, and see the monuments to civil progress and mercantile ambition that had helped turn Edinburgh into a world-renowned center of intellectual labor. He was studying medicine in part because the university boasted one of the finest medical departments in the world. In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment had flowered in this center of research and publishing---philosopher and mathematician Dugald Stewart, economist Adam Smith, geologist James Hutton, and many others. Walter Scott, [Doyle’s] favorite novelist in his later youth, had been born in College Wynd, by Cowgate, not far from [Doyle’s] own birthplace; had lived in George Square by the university that [Doyle] attended every day, and had died only a generation before [Doyle’s] birth. Ambition and artistry were in the very air of Edinburgh.</p>

    <p>Hilbert adores Marian. He follows her around all day, supervising her gardening, sitting on her keyboard, begging to be brushed at night, and just generally jumping into her lap whenever the opportunity presents itself. Here he is getting a glorious chin scritching while Marian is relaxing on the sofa. What more can a cat ask for?</p>

<p class="">For some time now I’ve been trying to increasingly work with my technology in terms of contexts, not apps. I don’t want to open the Mail App to check email. Instead, I want to open the mail app to look at my legal inbox and nothing else. I don’t want to open Safari to a home page. Instead, I want to open Safari to the specific page on my learn.macsparky platform that lets me manage customer support issues. Staying in context means avoiding getting sidetracked. It means checking the email in one account and not crashing into my email from&nbsp;<em>every account</em>. It means fixing a customer support problem without getting trapped by surfing dogs. (Yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://preview.convertkit-mail.com/click/3ohphkhdwn0r6z/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj10RE9NLVU3dVN0TQ==" target="_blank">There are surfing dogs</a>, and I love them.)<br><br>This idea started for me on the iPhone and quickly found its way to the iPad, using Shortcuts. Over the last few months, I've implemented this context-based computing on my Mac and it’s glorious. I'm pulling it all off with Keyboard Maestro. There are three areas in my life: Personal, MacSparky, and the legal practice. With just a few keyboard shortcuts I can perform all of my most common tasks in each area of my life&nbsp;<em>in context&nbsp;</em>using Keyboard Maestro.<br><br>Best of all,&nbsp;<strong>I'm going to share how I'm pulling this off in a free webinar on August 27</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://event.webinarjam.com/register/1/pwzg8hx">You can sign up now</a>.&nbsp;It will be a fun event full of Keyboard Maestro scripts and tips. It will be the first Field Guide webinar and I'm putting a lot of effort into it. I hope to see you on August 27.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you'd like to see the webinar but can't make it on August 27, go ahead and sign up. I'll be sending out a link to watch a recording of the webinar afterward.</p>

      Posted on 14 August 2020 at 6:48&thinsp;pm
      • Kevin Drum – Mother Jones
      
        • by Kevin Drum
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/08/president-trump-has-a-great-idea-about-social-security-really/">A couple of days ago</a> I wrote that Donald Trump accidentally had a good idea when he proposed doing away with the payroll tax that funds Social Security. This prompted several readers to push back on the grounds that funding Social Security through ordinary income taxes would make it a budgetary football every year. But that&#8217;s not how it works.</p>
<p>Social Security is an entitlement. Technically, it&#8217;s classified as mandatory spending, which means that it gets paid out automatically and doesn&#8217;t require an annual appropriation. If you qualify, you get Social Security. Period. It doesn&#8217;t matter where the funding comes from.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that for the next couple of decades Social Security will be partially funded by income taxes anyway. The infamous trust fund, after all, is nothing but a bunch of government bonds in a filing cabinet somewhere in Virginia. If payroll taxes are insufficient to cover Social Security payments, the bonds are cashed in. And where does the money to redeem the bonds come from? The general fund, of course, which consists primarily of money from income taxes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how this all plays out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security payments are mandatory regardless of how they&#8217;re funded. Congress does not approve a Social Security budget every year.</li>
<li>Payroll taxes are regressive. Nobody on the left should defend them.</li>
<li>Income taxes are progressive. We like progressive taxes!</li>
<li>Funding Social Security through the general fund means (a) it&#8217;s funded by a progressive tax, and (b) there&#8217;s no more trust fund and no more blather about Social Security &#8220;going bankrupt&#8221; or similar nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back when Social Security was first started, FDR defended the payroll tax as &#8220;straight politics.&#8221; It was a way of tricking people into thinking that the money coming out of their paycheck was being &#8220;saved&#8221; in some way and then paid back to them when they retired. This has never been true, and FDR knew it, but it was a useful way of guaranteeing that Social Security couldn&#8217;t be touched in the future.</p>
<p>That may have been necessary 90 years ago, but it&#8217;s not anymore. It&#8217;s not the funding source that stops Congress from cutting Social Security payments, it&#8217;s the broad support for the program itself. It&#8217;s just too damn popular to screw around with.</p>
<p>Bottom line: There are several upsides to funding Social Security through the general fund and literally no downsides. This is something that any progressive should support.</p>

    <p>Jonathan Hoefler, on designing the new Biden-Harris logo without knowing that Kamala Harris would be Joe Biden’s pick for running mate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t remember an election in which so much attention (and
speculation) has surrounded the choice of a running mate, nor
having such a large field of eminently qualified candidates to
choose from. A consequential decision at an unpredictable time,
conducted under absolute secrecy, poses an interesting dilemma to
the typographer: how do you create a logo without knowing for
certain what the words will say? Logos, after all, are
meaningfully informed by the shapes of their letters, and a logo
designed for an <span class="caps">EISENHOWER</span> will hardly
work for a <span class="caps">TAFT</span>. The solution,
naturally, involves the absurd application of brute force: you
just design all the logos you can think of, based on whatever
public information you can gather. Every credible suggestion
spotted in an op-ed was added to the list that we designers
maintained, and not once did the campaign even hint at a
preference for one name over another.</p>

    <p>Here&#8217;s something you might not have seen before: average earnings of blue collar workers over the past few months. Thanks to the rescue bills—primarily the CARES Act—average pay for blue collar workers has gone up 4 percent since February:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859194"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1268px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859194" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_blue_collar_weekly_july_2020.gif" alt="" width="1268" height="634"></figure>
<p>And what are people doing with this extra money? Putting it in the bank and then drawing it down:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_859197"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1267px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-859197" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_personal_savings_july_2020.gif" alt="" width="1267" height="624"></figure>
<p>Workers drew down $3 trillion in savings in May and June. At this rate, the extra savings generated by the CARES Act will be gone by the end of August. September is going to be a very grim month for a lot of people if Congress doesn&#8217;t get itself back in session quickly and pass another rescue bill. Because it&#8217;s a dead certainty that COVID-19 won&#8217;t be gone by then.</p>

<a href="https://www.muji.us/store/4548076252818.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Point Pressing Ball</a> ($8)<br />
This is a little thing that I picked up on a trip to Tokyo. A friend of mine hauled me into a Muji. They&#8217;re all over the world, but they&#8217;re not everywhere. It&#8217;s a porcelain ball that looks like if you put a golf ball through some sort of dimensional torque and got it to expand and contract. And so, it has little knobs all over it. Then what I like to do is just rub it around my hands and rub my feet over it, especially if I&#8217;ve been walking a lot, and especially if I&#8217;m out and I don&#8217;t have my regular massage tools. I&#8217;ve used a whole bunch of other types of hand and foot massage things. What I like about this is that it&#8217;s very social in that I can use it and nobody can hear it. So it doesn&#8217;t make any noise and I&#8217;m not likely to drop it too much, whereas some of the other massage balls for hands and feet, I feel like I&#8217;m either dropping them or they&#8217;re clacking around, or they&#8217;re making some sort of noise. This is super portable. I can throw it in my Dopp kit and then I&#8217;m off.</p>

I like this because it feels like origami for your face. It&#8217;s not paper, it&#8217;s not cloth. It&#8217;s a mask. There’s three folds. It has a part that sticks out. A friend of mine said kind of beak like, but it has a part that you can pull up over your nose and pull down under your chin. You can either use it over the ears or you can use it behind your head. I feel like it fits a lot of people&#8217;s faces. I&#8217;ve so far never seen anybody not look good in this. But what I really like about it is that it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s got great design on it. It&#8217;s got bright colors, and even the muted ones still look like they&#8217;re interesting to wear, and fun, and well-designed, and I feel that the part that sticks out allows me to breathe better. You don&#8217;t get that blow back when you&#8217;re talking or breathing. Another thing that I really like about it is, one, masks get worn out and stinky, and I think you get bored with them and you need something to look forward to. This is something coming in the mail that is bright and colorful and makes you excited to wear it. If you&#8217;re going to be excited to wear any mask, this would be the one that I&#8217;d be excited to wear.</p>

My gaming is usually around word games. Star Battle Go is not a word game. I think most people describe it as having a more Sudoku feel to it. When I read the notes on it, it said it was created in 2003 by a Dutch creator. A friend of mine saw this game somewhere and she decided to make her own. So she created the game, and the way she designed is so elegant. It just works very well. Imagine if you have a 10 by 10 square, and you have different shapes within it. And within those shapes, you can have only two stars, and you have to place the stars. You can only have two stars per column and two stars per row. You have to figure out, in this row, in this column, and in this shape, how to place your stars. And then, of course, it will fill in the places that you can&#8217;t place your stars, or you can make it harder on yourself and not give yourself those clues. There are other versions of this game but this one is simple and well-designed and the puzzles are great. It is my current fav phone strategy game and mind refresher and my only non word-based game.</p>

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/song-sleuth-auto-bird-song-id/id968399159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Song Sleuth: Auto Bird Song ID</a><br />
I&#8217;ll give you the background: In these last three months, there&#8217;s not been a lot of noise. And I think there&#8217;s been more birds. Birds have been chattering away, or I&#8217;ve noticed them more. So it&#8217;s pretty exciting to walk outside and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is that? It&#8217;s like the cycling noise or a rat-a-tat-tat, or what&#8217;s going on? A friend of mine turned me on to Song Sleuth, which is if you want to call it Shazam for birds. You have to record it and then you pull down the recording. There&#8217;s a way for you to manipulate the sound recording so that you&#8217;re just isolating, as much as possible, the bird sound. Then it says ID and it runs it against what it knows and gives you some possible matches. Then allows you to hear what those birds are so that you then can determine if the match is correct. This is not a tool for expert birders. There&#8217;s all sorts of complaining going on out there. But for me, I&#8217;m not an expert birder. I don&#8217;t know anything. I&#8217;m just looking at something and going, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; And it surprises me. A lot of times, what I&#8217;ve gotten are like House Finch. So it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m getting back things that are so revelatory. Every once in a while, it&#8217;ll give me something super uncommon, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re just toying with me. I did not hear some super rare bird.” So I think that there&#8217;s room to grow with this app, but it&#8217;s just fun to play with, and hear, and observe, when I think that more wildlife is out there taking up space that humans used to be taking up.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://twitter.com/safecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Safecast</strong></a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> is a way for people and communities to self-publish environmental data. What that amounts to is, how do I know if my air is clean or how do I know what the radiation is around me? The reason why we publish air quality and radiation are that Safecast originally was born out of the Daiichi Fukushima nuclear meltdown. It started almost nine years ago with that event, and people at the time did not know what their radiation exposure was. They got to gather and figured out a way to build small handheld mobile radiation measurement devices and then they went and mapped their environment to find out what their exposure had been. That ended up being a wonderful worldwide project. And so, the newest monitor that we&#8217;re working with is the Airnote, which was put together by Safecast volunteers. It has this great ability to be placed anywhere because it doesn&#8217;t require WiFi, and it doesn&#8217;t require an electricity source. It has a solar cell. It automatically uploads data so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. You can just place it wherever works best for you. One of the things that is really important to me about that is that it makes it really accessible to more people. It will allow people who can&#8217;t afford WiFi, or don&#8217;t have maybe a space next to their home, they&#8217;ll be able to place it somewhere and do some documentation as well.</p>

<p class="">Allison Sheridan and Bart Busschots did a series on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/subscribe-to-the-podcasts/" target="_blank"><span>Allison’s podcast</span></a>&nbsp;about using the Mac Terminal. I remember thinking&nbsp;at the time how brave they were to talk about something so technical in the audio format, but Allison and Bart got it just right. Now they have&nbsp;<a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/taming-the-terminal/id1525625941" target="_blank"><span>released the series as a free eBook on the Apple Book Store</span></a>, or if you’re interested in other formats like PDF, HTML, or Kindle, you can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://podfeet.com/tttbook" target="_blank"><span>podfeet.com/tttbook</span></a>. If you would like some help getting started with Terminal, this is a great resource (and weekend project).</p>

    <p>Let <em>n</em> be a positive integer and <em>x</em> any real number. If you multiply <em>x</em> by <em>n</em>, then divide by <em>n</em>, of course you get <em>x</em> back.</p>
<p>Now suppose you multiply <em>x</em> by <em>n</em>, round down, then divide by <em>n</em>, and round down again. Do you get <em>x</em> back?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. The last step rounds down to an integer, so you couldn&#8217;t possibly get <em>x</em> back unless <em>x</em> was an integer to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you do get back <em>x</em> rounded down to the nearest integer. In symbols,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/mult_div_floor.svg" alt="\left\lfloor \frac{\lfloor nx \rfloor}{n} \right\rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor" width="111" height="43" /></p>
<p>Here ⌊<em>y</em>⌋ is the floor of <em>y</em>, the greatest integer less than or equal to <em>y</em>. I found this via Problem 5 <a href="https://orion.math.iastate.edu/ehjohnst/PoW/Sp2020/Sp2020.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The equation says that, in a limited sense, multiplication and division commute with taking floors. But you do have to assume <em>n</em> is an integer, and it&#8217;s important that you multiply first, then divide. The corresponding equation where you divide first doesn&#8217;t always hold.</p>
<p>The relationship above may not seem so surprising if you haven&#8217;t worked with floors, but generally floors and ceilings don&#8217;t play so nicely with other operations. The most tedious chapter of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RU4rgV">Concrete Mathematics</a> is probably the one devoted to manipulating expressions with floors and ceilings. Once you expect these manipulations to be difficult, which they usually are, you find it remarkable that something would work out so simply.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of an immediate application for this identity, though I vaguely recall wanting to use something like this and concluding that it probably wasn&#8217;t true.</p>

    <p>You’ll forgive the pun, but <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">Epic Games revealed an epic update to Fortnite for iOS today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and
Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct
payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment
processing savings to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What costs $10 through an App Store payment costs only $8 direct from Epic. (That’s not really passing the entirety of the savings to the user — Epic nets $7 from a $10 App Store in-app purchase, but minus credit card fees nets about $7.75 from an $8 direct payment. But, from a user’s perspective, it’s a 20 percent discount.)</p>

<p>Epic shipped this feature via an update that was delivered entirely through the Fortnite app itself, not through a new version of the app submitted through the App Store. And yes, this entire gambit is every bit as against the rules of the App Store as you think it is. Epic did this without any permission from Apple and without giving Apple any notice.</p>

<p>The only question was what Apple would do. If Apple decided to play on Easy mode, their move might have been to keep Fortnite in the App Store but stop accepting updates to the app. (But again, Fortnite shipped this particular feature without submitting a new version of the app itself.) Playing on Medium difficulty, which is what Apple chose, meant removing Fortnite — an immensely popular game — from the App Store.<sup id="fnr1-2020-08-13"><a href="#fn1-2020-08-13">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here’s Apple’s statement, in its entirety, which they sent to multiple publications (including Daring Fireball) hours after Epic’s opening gambit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App
Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and
designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their
Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a
feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple,
and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store
guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer
who sells digital goods or services.</p>

<p>Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have
benefited from the App Store ecosystem — including it’s [<em>sic</em>]
tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all
developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines
freely and we’re glad they’ve built such a successful business on
the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead
them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact
that these guidelines create a level playing field for all
developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make
every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they
can return Fortnite to the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was very clear this morning that Epic knew exactly what it was doing, and how Apple was likely to respond. In very short order after Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store, <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1293994211621167105">Epic filed a lawsuit</a>, which opens guns-a-blazing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1984, the fledgling Apple computer company released the
Macintosh — the first mass-market, consumer-friendly home
computer. The product launch was announced with a breathtaking
advertisement evoking George Orwell’s 1984 that cast Apple as a
beneficial, revolutionary force breaking IBM’s monopoly over the
computing technology market. Apple’s founder Steve Jobs introduced
the first showing of the 1984 advertisement by explaining, “it
appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope
to offer IBM a run for its money…. Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was
George Orwell right about 1984?”</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020, and Apple has become what it once railed
against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block
competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more
powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the
monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion,
Apple’s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology
monopolist in history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic’s filing wastes little time. By page 5 it reaches the point where they accuse Apple of “illegal restraints” that keep Epic from providing its own competing iOS app store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic — and Fortnite’s users — are directly harmed by Apple’s
anti-competitive conduct. But for Apple’s illegal restraints,
Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which
would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated
store and would provide users the choice to use Epic’s or another
third-party’s in-app payment processing tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear, of course, what Epic <em>actually</em> hopes to get from Apple, either voluntarily or forced by the courts, but they’re asking for the whole shebang: they’re claiming it is illegal for iOS not to be as open to native third-party software as the Mac.</p>

<p>Epic also had a new commercial queued up that makes their argument much more artfully — it’s a strident parody of Apple’s iconic “1984” spot, with the obvious but still clever title <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4">Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite</a></em>. You really have to see it — Fortnite has a fun strong brand and they poured that into this. It closes with this title card:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation,
Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight
to stop 2020 from becoming “1984”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a preaching-to-the-choir aspect to Epic’s entire campaign, though. Both the ad and the legal filing seem directed toward an audience that enjoys decals of Calvin pissing on the Apple logo. The ad is in some ways a deft parody, and it is very saucy, but one thing it is not is funny.</p>

<p>Epic, in a very savvy way, is waging this war as much or more in the court of public opinion as they are in any court of law. And, ultimately, Apple stands to lose more in brand equity than in dollars, no matter how this turns out.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1-2020-08-13">
<p>Playing on Hard mode would be Apple flipping the kill switch to disable already-installed copies of Fortnite on iOS devices. I don’t think that was on the table as Apple’s opening move, and even now that Epic has revealed itself to be playing hardball, it would be heavy-handed, to say the least. What makes this a fair fight is that Fortnite is already installed on so many millions of iOS devices. Popularity is power. Removing Fortnite from the App Store (which, again, also blocks existing users from getting app updates) is a big move, but most iOS users who are in Fortnite’s target audience already have it installed. That’s not tenable in the long run, but it gives Epic and Apple time to spar without disrupting existing iOS Fortnite users from continuing to play.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2020-08-13"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

    <p>Similar opening statement to their suit against Apple, substituting “Don’t be evil” for “1984”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a
unique motto: “Don’t Be Evil”. Google’s Code of Conduct explained
that this admonishment was about “how we serve our users” and
“much more than that … it’s also about doing the right thing
more generally”. Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated
its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do
evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew
of markets it has grown to monopolize. This case is about doing
the right thing in one important area, the Android mobile
ecosystem, where Google unlawfully maintains monopolies in
multiple related markets, denying consumers the freedom to enjoy
their mobile devices — freedom that Google always promised
Android users would have.</p>

    <p>A while back I wrote about <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/08/04/continued-fraction-sqrt/">continued fractions of square roots</a>. That post cited a theorem that if <em>d</em> is not a perfect square, then the continued fraction representation of <em>d</em> is periodic. The period consists of a palindrome followed by 2⌊√<em>d</em>⌋. See that post for details and examples.</p>
<p>One thing the post did not address is the length of the period. The post gave the example that the continued fraction for √5 has period 1, i.e. the palindrome part is empty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/continued_fraction_sqrt5.svg" alt="\sqrt{5} = 2 + \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \cfrac{1}{4+ \ddots}}}}" width="228" height="128" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a theorem [1] that says this pattern happens if and only if <em>d</em> = <em>n</em>² + 1. That is, the continued fraction for √<em>d</em> is periodic with period 1 if and only if <em>d</em> is one more than a square. So if we wanted to find the continued fraction expression for √26, we know it would have period 1. And because each period ends in 2⌊√26⌋ = 10, we know all the coefficients after the initial 5 are equal to 10.</p>

    <p>Google’s statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through
multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the
Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to
developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite
remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available
on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the
opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring
Fortnite back to Google Play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can still sideload Fortnite via direct download from Epic, or install it from Samsung’s Galaxy Store (which only works with Samsung devices).</p>

<p>Dieter Bohn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given Epic’s outsized response to Apple’s ban — the lawsuit and
the 1984 ad — it’s a sure bet that the company will have a
response to Google as well. We’ll obviously let you know what that
is when it happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, can’t wait for the slick Google ad parody that I’m sure Epic has already made and has been waiting all day to fire off. Holding my breath here.</p>

    <p>Epic Games, the makers of the popular game Fortnite, doesn’t appreciate that mobile platform owners—we’re talking Apple and Google—demand that if you use their app stores, you have to pay them 30% of digital sales, which in Epic Games’s case, is basically 30% of everything it makes.</p>
<p>It hated Google’s policies so much that it initially released Fortnite for Android <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store">via sideloading only</a>, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software">begrudgingly giving in a year and a half later</a> and agreeing to Google’s terms to get on Google Play.</p>
<p>I’ll say this for them—they’re consistent. On Thursday Epic turned on a new Fortnite feature and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">trumpeted it in a press release</a>—it was bringing direct purchase of digital goods to its iOS and Google Play apps, and at substantial discounts to buying through the purchase methods offered by Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a violation of the terms of both app stores, and Epic knew it would get shut down on both platforms. Which it did. But no worries—it had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4&amp;feature=youtu.be">video mocking Apple for the decision</a> ready to drop, and <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf">a lawsuit ready to be filed</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the usual story of a developer accidentally stepping into a confusing App Store policy, or even of a developer gently pushing the limits of the App store rules only to be rebuked. I doubt Epic Games has any expectation that they’ll be able to use this publicity as leverage to get Apple and Google to agree to different payment terms. That ship has sailed. What Epic Games wants to do is go to war with Apple and Google—in both actual courts and, more importantly, in the court of public opinion.</p>
<p>What Epic Games seems to want is for it to be illegal for platform owners to force software developers through a single commerce engine, from which the platform owners skim a percentage of the take. Epic’s behavior on Android suggests that it’s not <em>really</em> advocating for the freedom to sideload its app on iOS—because it knows that it would likely be an even worse user experience than what it found on Android. Epic wants the freedom to install its own sales engine in its app and keep all the money.</p>
<p>Epic also knows that this is all happening at a time where stories of large tech companies using their power to increase their control and profitability are breaking on a regular basis. Legislators and regulators have threatened to investigate and punish big tech companies, including Apple and Google. This is another log on the fire.</p>
<p>How this will end is anyone’s guess. It will be interesting to see how the tech giants play this. I really do believe that, if left to its own devices, Apple would simply shrug and walk away, leaving Epic unable to reach people who want to play Fortnite on an iPhone or iPad. But surely Apple is also considering the potential threat of government intervention in its business. If I were at Apple, I would rate that threat as one of the top two existential threats to Apple. (The other is Apple’s reliance on China both as a place to sell products and as its manufacturing hub, given the deteriorating relationship between it and the U.S.)</p>
<p>This goes beyond arguing over money. Should Apple be allowed to keep Microsoft’s game-streaming service off its platforms? Should the maker of any computing platform be able to set itself up as the arbiter of what software and services can run on it? Right now, companies have a great deal of latitude in this area—which is why the Mac has a free and open software market and the iPad and iPhone don’t.</p>
<p>My inclination is that Apple should compete on the merits of its features, rather than winning because it’s the only option. Apple’s in-app purchase system will be simpler, more convenient, and more familiar to most users of its platforms. Add in Sign In With Apple and Apple Pay and things could become even more frictionless. If Apple is afraid that video-game-streaming services threaten the future of games in the App Store, I can relate—but if that’s truly the future of gaming, Apple won’t prevent it from coming true by banning the future from its store. It’ll just end up being behind the times.</p>
<p>But this is a complicated, multi-faceted issue. Every time I try to simplify it, it gets more unwieldy. In the end, Apple can do what it wants—but it risks losing control of its platform if governments decide that what it’s doing needs to change.</p><p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/tired-of-paying-fees-to-platform-owners-epic-games-goes-to-court/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>

    <p>Take any positive integer <em>d</em> that is not a multiple of 2 or 5. Then there is some integer <em>k</em> such that <em>d</em> × <em>k</em> has only 1&#8217;s in its decimal representation. For example, take <em>d</em> = 13. We have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">13 × 8457 = 111111.</p>
<p>Or if we take <em>d</em> = 27,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">27 × 4115226337448559670781893 = 111111111111111111111111111.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change our perspective and start with the string of 1&#8217;s. If <em>d</em> is not a multiple of 2 or 5, then there is some number made up of only 1&#8217;s that is divisible by <em>d</em>. And in fact, the number of 1&#8217;s is no more than <em>d</em>.</p>
<p>This theorem generalizes to any integer base <em>b</em> &gt; 1. If <em>d</em> is relatively prime to <em>b</em>, then there is a base <em>b</em> number with <em>d</em> or fewer &#8220;digits&#8221; which is divisible by <em>d </em>[1].</p>
<p>The following Python code allows us to find the number <em>k</em> such that <em>d</em> × <em>k</em> has only 1&#8217;s in its base <em>b</em> representation, provided <em>k</em> is relatively prime to <em>b</em>. It returns the number of 1&#8217;s we need to string together to find a multiple of <em>k</em>. If <em>k</em> shares a factor with <em>b</em>, the code returns 0 because no string of 1&#8217;s will ever be divisible by <em>k</em>.</p>
<pre>    from math import gcd
    
    def all_ones(n, b = 10):
        return sum(b**i for i in range(n))
    
    def find_multiple(k, b = 10):
        if gcd(k, b) &gt; 1:
            return 0
        for n in range(1, k+1):
            if all_ones(n, b) % k == 0:
                return n
</pre>
<p>The two Python functions above default to base 10 if a base isn&#8217;t provided.</p>
<p>We could find a multiple of 5 whose hexadecimal representation is all 1&#8217;s by calling</p>
<pre>    print(find_multiple(5, 16))</pre>
<p>and this tells us that 11111<sub>sixteen</sub> is a multiple of 5, and in fact</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5 × 369d<sub>sixteen</sub> = 11111<sub>sixteen</sub>.</p>

<p id="p5">Shortly after the game was pulled from the App Store by Apple, Epic filed a 62-page lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging violations of the federal Sherman Act and a similar California state statute.</p>
<p id="p6"><a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Epic</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion, Apple&rsquo;s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology monopolist in history.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">The complaint alleges anti-competitive conduct in connection with the distribution of iOS apps and in-app payment processing. According to Epic:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote9"><p>
  But for Apple&rsquo;s illegal restraints, Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices, which would allow iOS users to download apps in an innovative, curated store and would provide users the choice to use Epic&rsquo;s or another third-party&rsquo;s in-app payment processing tool.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p10">The lawsuit concludes with a request that the court issue an injunction prohibiting the behavior, declaring it unlawful, and ordering other equitable relief to prevent Apple&rsquo;s actions and remedy the alleged harm that has been caused.</p>
<p id="p11">The lawsuit was followed by an in-game video parodying Apple&rsquo;s famous 1984 commercial asking Fortnite gamers to &ldquo;Join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming &lsquo;1984.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div12"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></div>
<p id="p13">Based on the timing of events, it appears that Epic intentionally violated Apple&rsquo;s app review guidelines to pick a fight. I would be surprised if backroom negotiations didn&rsquo;t precede the filing of the lawsuit, but regardless, Epic&rsquo;s actions raise another line of attack against the way Apple runs the App Store. What&rsquo;s different about Epic&rsquo;s lawsuit is that it&rsquo;s brought by a well-funded, private company that has hired <a href="https://www.cravath.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest global law firms</a> to fight for it. Barring a quick settlement, this will cost both companies a lot of money and subject Apple to bad publicity over a much longer period of time than a day&rsquo;s testimony in front of Congress ever could.</p>

<p>Of course, this was asking to be removed from the App Store.</p>

<p>Apple, quoted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">Juli Clover</a>, explains this and continues to gaslight us (also: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24146902">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">
<p>Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the  App Store  guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the  App Store  guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic was ready with a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf">lawsuit</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24147486">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf"><p>Mobile computing devices (like smartphones and tablets)&mdash;and the apps that run on those devices&mdash;have become an integral part of people&rsquo;s daily lives; as a primary source for news, a place for entertainment, a tool for business, a means to connect with friends and family, and more. For many consumers, mobile devices are their primary computers to stay connected to the digital world, as they may not even own a personal computer. When these devices are unfairly restricted and extortionately &ldquo;taxed&rdquo; by Apple, the consumers who rely on these mobile devices to stay connected in the digital age are directly harmed.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Epic is not seeking monetary compensation from this Court for the injuries it has suffered. Nor is Epic seeking favorable treatment for itself, a single company. Instead, Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There is no security justification for requiring the use of In-App Purchase for a user&rsquo;s in-app purchase of in-app content.

    <p>Lu Wang and Vildana Hajric, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc.’s planned stock split will diminish its influence on
the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the iPhone maker’s 100%
surge since March lows nearly dragged the price-weighted measure
back to an all-time high.</p>

<p>At its current price of $452 a share, Apple has the biggest
weighting in the index at 11%. A 4-to-1 split now would drop its
price tag to about $113 and send its ranking in the Dow Average
down to 16th. Apple has rallied almost 55% in 2020, adding more
than 1,100 points to a stock measure that’s fallen about 2% during
that time. The split is scheduled to take effect Aug. 31. […]</p>

<p>The split, however, won’t affect Apple’s No. 1 position in the S&amp;P
500, an index that’s weighted by market capitalization, rather
than stock prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg reports this as though the difference in how the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are weighted is equivalent. The S&amp;P 500 makes sense: it values companies by what the companies are worth. The Dow makes no goddamn sense at all: it values companies by their share price.</p>

<p>A high-profile stock split like Apple’s should make the entire finance world snap out of its delusion and just abolish the Dow. A 4-for-1 stock split is exactly the same in principle as exchanging a dollar bill for 4 quarters. You still have one dollar. But according to the Dow, you go from 100 (the dollar bill) to 25 (the value of a single one of the post-split quarters).</p>

<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is that stupid.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/01/04/508261371/episode-443-dont-believe-the-hype">See this classic 2013 episode of NPR’s Planet Money for more</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s no secret that we here at Planet Money think the Dow is a
terrible economic indicator. We don’t like that it only looks at
thirty companies. We don’t like the way it does its math. We think
it does a bad job reflecting the overall economy. Honestly, we’re
not sure why everyone is still talking about it.</p>

    <p>Tripp Mickle wrote a long feature for The Wall Street Journal, “How Tim Cook Made Apple His Own” (<a href="https://apple.news/Azb-hAvJuS4yr89Cy8Pccog">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Steve Jobs’s death, Silicon Valley anticipated Apple Inc.’s
business would falter. Wall Street fretted about the road ahead.
And loyal customers agonized about the future of a beloved product
innovator.</p>

<p>Today, Apple shares are at record highs. The company’s market
valuation is $1.9 trillion — bigger than the GDP of Canada,
Russia or Spain. And Apple, now the world’s largest company,
continues to dominate the smartphone market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good and mostly fair lede. But I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that “loyal customers agonized about the future”. Where’s the evidence of that? I’d say the group that’s missing after Silicon Valley (which believes strongly, justifiably in most cases, in the importance of founders) and Wall Street is <em>business reporters</em>. It wasn’t so much investors as the business media who predicted “can’t innovate without Steve Jobs” doom for Apple.</p>

<p>The feature is largely fair though, and it does read like Mickle tried very hard to get people who know Cook to talk about him. But, well, very few of them did, and those who did don’t seem to know him all that well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Cook is described by colleagues and acquaintances as a humble
workaholic with a singular commitment to Apple. Longtime
colleagues seldom socialized with him, and assistants said he kept
his calendar clear of personal events.</p>

<p>Around Thanksgiving two years ago, guests saw him dining by
himself at the secluded Amangiri Hotel near Zion National Park.
When a guest later bumped into him, he said he came to the hotel
to recharge after a hectic fall punctuated by the rollout of
Apple’s latest iPhone. “They have the best masseuses in the world
here,” he said, the guest recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Mickle’s source is a random guest who recognized Cook at a hotel.</p>

<p>It’s sort of inside baseball, but this paragraph is my favorite from the whole piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple declined to make Mr. Cook or any of its executives
available. Instead, the company helped arrange calls with four
people it said could speak to areas of importance to Mr. Cook such
as environmentalism, education and health. None of the four said
they knew him well. One had never met him, another met him only in
passing, a third spent half an hour with him and a fourth spent a
few hours with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean just savor the passive-aggressive <em>fuck you/fuck you too</em> back-and-forth of Apple making available four useless sources to Mickle, and Mickle pointing out in the article just how useless the four sources Apple made available were.</p>

<p>But this one weird paragraph actually says a lot about the difference between Steve Jobs’s Apple and Cook’s. Jobs wouldn’t have participated in a profile like this, either, but I think Apple’s response would have been nothing more than the two-letter word “no”. With Cook, Apple still didn’t make him available, still didn’t make anyone who works at Apple available, and still didn’t make anyone who actually knows Cook available. But they offered Mickle and the Journal <em>something</em> rather than just telling him to go pound sand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though current and former employees say Mr. Cook has created a
more relaxed workplace than Mr. Jobs, he has been similarly
demanding and detail oriented. He once got irritated that the
company mistakenly shipped 25 computers to South Korea instead of
Japan, said a former colleague, adding that it seemed like a minor
misstep for a company shipping nearly 200 million iPhones
annually. “We’re losing our commitment to excellence,” Mr. Cook
said, this person recalls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>25 computers mistakenly shipped to Korea would not make my list of signs that Apple is losing its commitment to excellence, but this anecdote actually buoys me.</p>

    <p>Catalin Cimpanu, reporting for ZDNet Zero Day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, Mozilla’s contract with Google to include Google as
the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later
this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal
has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla’s
revenue, and without it experts see <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">a dim future for Mozilla past
2021</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s basically the whole story right there. Firefox was very popular, and Google paid Mozilla a small fortune to make Google search the default in Firefox because it was so popular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">But then came Chrome</a>. Why should Google fund Mozilla when Chrome is about 10 times more popular than Firefox, other than out of the goodness of its corporate heart?</p>

<p>It is a very good thing for the world and the web that a truly independent browser exists from a privacy-minded company, but there’s not much of a business model for it unless it’s popular enough to get the dominant search engine to pay for placement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We must learn and expand different ways to support ourselves and
build a business that isn’t what we see today.”</p>

<p>This most likely includes a bigger focus <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-to-launch-vpn-product-in-the-next-few-weeks/">on Mozilla’s VPN
offering</a>, which Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/07/15/mozilla-puts-its-trusted-stamp-on-vpn/">formally launched last month</a>.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps are one of today’s biggest
money-makers in tech, and Mozilla, despite arriving late to the
party, is set to become one of the biggest players on the market,
primarily due to its reputation as a privacy-first organization
and civil and privacy rights advocate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea if a VPN offering can even come close to making up for the money Mozilla was earning from Google for default search placement, but it’s a great idea. If you’re going to use a VPN, you want to use one from a company you can trust, and Mozilla has a fortune of well-earned trust in the bank.</p>

    <p>Speaking of the postal service, why not finish the job of privatizing it? We hear a lot about the pension prefunding requirement that has wrecked its finances, but let&#8217;s face it: the real problem is the absurdly low rates that USPS is required to charge for first class mail. A first class stamp currently costs 55 cents, about half what it costs in Great Britain. Other countries are even higher, some charging $1.50 or more.</p>
<p>We should give the postal service control over their own rates along with control over everything else too. There would be some exceptions, of course: the basic deal in which USPS gets a monopoly on first class mail in return for universal service should remain intact. There are a few other rules that would remain as well. Generally speaking, though, there&#8217;s no special reason that delivering mail shouldn&#8217;t be about 99 percent private these days.</p>

    <p>Lauren Feiner, reporting for CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uber would likely shut down temporarily for several months if a
court does not overturn a recent ruling requiring it to classify
its drivers as full-time employees, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in
an interview with Stephanie Ruhle Wednesday on MSNBC.</p>

<p>“If the court doesn’t reconsider, then in California, it’s hard to
believe we’ll be able to switch our model to full-time employment
quickly,” Khosrowshahi said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1293635588076326912">Justin Wolfers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, an admission that Uber’s key innovation was to skirt
labor law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1293594313926905856">Noah Smith</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever you think of the employee/contractor issue, it seems
clear that if Uber can’t survive except by classifying drivers as
contractors, it was never as valuable of a business as people
thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two things can both be true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Uber saw how terrible traditional U.S. taxi services were, and created a much better alternative that people love to use, entirely based on the key insight that ubiquitous smartphones could and should change the game. Hailing, mapping, location tracking, payment, driver/passenger rating — all of it enabled via phones.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that this business model was worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars was based almost entirely on exploiting a gray area in labor law, and thus the company’s workers.</p></li>
<li><p>The founder was an enormous jackass.</p></li>

<p>OK, that’s three, but they’re still all true.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading more of Anne Applebaum’s <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/red-famine-anne-applebaum/1125686131?ean=9780804170888" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;Red Famine&quot;</a> and getting all sorts of smart. I&#39;ve also been getting all sorts of angry, all sorts of depressed, all sorts of horrified, all sorts of scared out of my mind, and all sorts of confirmation of my standing belief that people are no damned good.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution, when the Bolsheviks were consolidating their power in the nascent Soviet Union, Stalin, under Lenin’s direction, waged a war of attrition against Ukraine using starvation as a weapon of mass destruction. Kulak was a general term for prosperous small landholders and farmers. Shlikhter was Alexander Shikhter, the recently named People’s Commissar of Food Collection in Ukraine, and isn&#39;t that job title pure Soviet-speak?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While attacking the Kulaks, Shlikhter simultaneously created a new class of allies through the institution of “poor peasants” committees…[the committees] would later play a role in the Ukrainian famine, but their origins lay in this immediate, post-revolutionary moment, in Shlikhter’s first grain collection campaign. Under his direction, Red Army Soldiers and Russian agitators moved from village to village, recruiting the least successful, least productive, most opportunistic peasants and offering them power, privileges, and land confiscated from their neighbors. In exchange, these carefully recruited collaborators were expected to find and confiscate the “grain surpluses” of their neighbors. These mandatory grain collections created overwhelming anger and resentment, neither of which ever really went away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump said Thursday that <strong>he does not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are seeking to expand mail-in voting</strong> during the coronavirus pandemic, making explicit the reason he has declined to approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the cash-strapped agency.</p>
<p>“Now, they need that money in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. He added: <strong>“Now, if we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I don&#8217;t think anyone should be surprised that Trump is willing to wreck the postal service in order to gain some minor personal advantage. That&#8217;s our boy. But what still gets me is that he&#8217;s willing to blandly admit it on national TV and nobody seems to care. Does no one in the Republican Party object to this? Are Trump&#8217;s supporters so wildly anti-Democrat that they think this is a great idea?</p>
<p>And has no one ever told Trump that this isn&#8217;t going to hurt Democrats very much anyway? He&#8217;s just ruining the mail for nothing.</p>

I haven’t made one yet, because the last part hasn’t arrived, but I have high hopes.“ Note: This could be employed as a COVID-19 respirator but you’d need to add exhaust filters.</p>

<p>When you’re away from home for a few days, what to do about plants that need regular watering? Here’s a solution I just bumped into and am eager to try. Fill a clean bottle with water, put your fingers over the opening as you stab the bottle into the soil. The water will leach out as the soil gets dry. That’s the theory, anyone. Has anyone here tried this?</p>

<p id="p2">There was no better time than 2020 for my discovery of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal</a>, the immersive ambient noise app I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/portal-review-immersive-ambient-noise-with-philips-hue-integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed at the start of the year</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">Back in January Portal impressed me with its multifaceted approach to providing an escape from your current surroundings. Not only are the app&rsquo;s 3D soundscapes of a high sound quality and perfectly paired with headphones, especially noise-cancelling ones like AirPods Pro, but Portal also engages your other senses to help you focus, sleep, or mentally escape when you can&rsquo;t physically escape. One way the app does this is through its visual scenes, which provide each different sound portal with a location&rsquo;s snapshot that your imagination can lock on to. Another way is via Philips Hue integration, which enables your home lights to automatically sync to different colors and brightness settings that fit best with the portal environment you&rsquo;ve chosen. This combination of immersive sound with visual scenes and real-world correlation via smart lights makes Portal a uniquely holistic experience.</p>
<p id="p4">I&rsquo;ve been using Portal ever since January, but even more since March, when my ability to physically leave home was drastically scaled back. I don&rsquo;t use it when sleeping, but it&rsquo;s certainly helped me both focus and escape, providing the much-needed feeling of being in a new environment even when my physical surroundings are left unchanged. For these reasons, as well as the presence of features like breathing exercises in the app, I find it appropriate to call Portal not just an ambient noise utility, but a wellness app too.</p>
<p id="p5">Today, Portal is launching a big 3.0 update that leans into its core strengths by providing more of what makes the app great: its portals. Previously the app offered a total of 19 portals, and today that number more than doubles as 25 new portals have been added for a total of 44 &ndash; and more are on the way.</p>
<p id="p6"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p7">With any other ambient noise app, a large batch of new sounds would be a nice addition, but not necessarily worth writing a new article about. But with Portal, since each of the 25 additions represents a real location that&rsquo;s been captured and optimized for the app, and paired with a custom Hue preset, adding 25 portals was clearly a huge undertaking. That level of effort shines through with all of the app&rsquo;s portals.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/01f7ebe4-a6a7-4506-a79e-2e47401147ea.png" alt="A few of the new portals in version 3.0."><p class="image-caption">A few of the new portals in version 3.0.</p></div>
<p id="p9">The set of 25 new portals is split into two collections: 14 portals from the Scottish Highlands, which were captured at wintertime, and 11 from the Slovenian Alps in summer. The app&rsquo;s new content library says that a Devon &amp; Cornwall collection will be added soon too.</p>
<p id="p10">Speaking of the content library, the huge expansion of portals offered necessitated a change in how you navigate the app. Previously, all available portals resided in a simple horizontal row you could swipe through. Even with the 19 previous portals, though, this was a bit unwieldy to navigate. Now you start with a limited selection of portals, and browse new ones to add from the content library. There&rsquo;s even editorial content that&rsquo;s been added as you browse, so you can not only see what the location looks like and hear what it sounds like, but also read some additional context about it.</p>
<p id="p11">I&rsquo;ve yet to come across a portal I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, but it&rsquo;s nice that you can now keep only the portals you value most. Another positive change is that all your saved portals can be rearranged in the order you prefer, making the navigation system of swiping between portals function better than before.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9c871268-e75c-4345-aece-cdb8c7e29b74.png" alt="Adding a portal to your collection."><p class="image-caption">Adding a portal to your collection.</p></div>
<p id="p13">Along with the big portal expansion and plans for continued new collections being added, Portal is introducing a membership plan today. You can still download the app for free and enjoy six portals perpetually at no cost; gaining access to the full content library, however, will require a $29.99 annual subscription for new users following a 7-day free trial. Membership revenue is intended to fuel continued creation of new portals as well as enable the app to expand beyond the iPhone and iPad &ndash; Mac and Apple TV versions are in the plans for Portal&rsquo;s team. I hope support for iPad multitasking is on the roadmap too.</p>
<p id="p14">As part of this membership rollout, Portal&rsquo;s developers are providing some of the most generous transition offers I&rsquo;ve seen for existing users of the app. If you&rsquo;ve previously paid for Portal in any way, either through unlocking the app&rsquo;s In-App Purchase or buying it when it was a paid app, you&rsquo;ll receive a lifetime membership entirely free. And if you&rsquo;ve previously downloaded the app at all, even though you&rsquo;ve never paid for it, you can unlock a lifetime membership for a one-time In-App Purchase of $9.99.</p>
<hr id="hr15"><p id="p16">Portal has proven essential to my peace of mind and productivity this year as I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time in a small New York City apartment, trying to work while my wife does the same just a few feet away. Combined with my AirPods Pro and noise cancellation, the app has been a dependable escape and focus tool. Both for work and relaxation, it&rsquo;s hard to beat the uniquely immersive experience Portal provides. If you ever find yourself in situations &ndash; whether at home, at the office, or elsewhere &ndash; when you need to create the feeling of being transported elsewhere, but can&rsquo;t actually leave, I can&rsquo;t recommend Portal highly enough.</p>
<p id="p17">Portal is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/portal-focus-sleep-escape/id1436994560?uo=4" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on the App Store</a> for iPhone and iPad.</p>

    <p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services?srnd=premium">may be ready to unleash a bundle of subscriptions alongside the iPhone this fall</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There will be different tiers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. A basic package will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurman’s careful to note that the bundle plans may change—which should go without saying, given that this is still a few months off. But the proposed structure here is interesting. Layering TV+ and Music at the base makes sense on the face of it: they’re both media services and Apple has a ton of control over how it sells TV+ (witness the free year that it offered along with device purchases starting last fall). Music is also probably one of the company’s strongest both in terms of paid subscribers and in terms of how it structures its deals with content providers.</p>
<p>Arcade makes sense as an add-on. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, its adoption seems to have slowed somewhat, which jibes with recent reports that Apple was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-30/apple-cancels-arcade-games-in-strategy-shift-to-keep-subscribers">reconsidering its strategy</a>. And News+ has been glacial in its pick-up by both consumers and news providers alike.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with iCloud, thrown in there at the end with a shrug. It’s perhaps the least interesting of Apple’s services, but also among the most in demand, thanks in no small part to the measly 5GB of standard storage the company continues to offer for free. By putting that at the high end of the pay list, users who want that storage may be convinced to fork over more money with the philosophy that at least they get a bunch of stuff thrown in (even if it’s stuff they don’t want).</p>
<p>Or, as one of the biggest and catchiest lies in capitalism has always put forth: “the more you spend, the more you save.”<sup id="fnref-12714-themoreyouspend"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-12714-themoreyouspend" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One additional tidbit that Gurman mentions is that Apple is working on a new subscription service focused around fitness, à la offerings from Nike. Given the rebranding of the Activity app to Fitness, and Apple’s continuing interests in health, this seems utterly plausible.</p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be that consumers will save $2-5 a month via bundle pricing. Which isn’t <em>nothing</em>, especially given the amount most consumers are probably paying for their mountain of subscriptions these days, but also may not prove that attractive. The real question will be whether Apple’s services are enticing enough to convince most customers to pay for ones that they might not even want.</p>

    <p>At first glance I thought this was just an exquisitely well-done gag, a recreation of some still frames. But it’s more than that. This short film by Lydia Cambron actually <em>works</em>. It’s magnificent.</p>

<p>If you want my advice, <a href="https://vimeo.com/446927270">watch the movie</a> before you even look at her website for it. And do not skip the credits, they’re truly essential.</p>

    <p>There are like a dozen different points Ritchie makes in this video where I was like, “Yes, that’s exactly what I’ve been trying to say.” The whole “What is a computer?” bit around the 5-minute mark is particularly well-done.</p>

    <p>I was explaining to someone this evening that I&#8217;m in the habit of saying &#8220;bang&#8221; rather than &#8220;exclamation point.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-pronounce.html">list</a> of similar nicknames for symbols.</p>
<p>These nicknames could complement the NATO phonetic alphabet if you needed to read symbols out loud, say over the phone. You might, for example, pronounce &#8220;HL&amp;P&#8221; as &#8220;Hotel Lima Pretzel Papa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you might use them to have one-syllable names for every symbol. This is a different objective than maximizing phonetic distinctiveness. For example, referring to <code>#</code> and <code>$</code> as &#8220;hash&#8221; and &#8220;cash&#8221; is succinct, but could easily be misheard.</p>
<p>You could also optimize for being clever. Along those lines, I like the idea of pronouncing the symbols <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> as &#8220;wane&#8221; and &#8220;wax&#8221;, by analogy with phases of the moon, though this would be a bad choice if you want to be widely and quickly understood.</p>
<p>Even if someone understood the allusion to lunar phases, and they knew which one looks like an opening parenthesis and which one looks like a closing parenthesis, they might get your meaning backward because they don&#8217;t live in the same hemisphere you do! I implicitly assumed the perspective of the northern hemisphere in the paragraph above. Someone from the southern hemisphere would understand &#8220;wane&#8221; to mean <code>)</code> and &#8220;wax&#8221; to mean <code>(</code>.</p>

    <p>Is this the most boring job in the world? I took this picture at 4:30 in the morning on Highway 78 in the middle of nowhere. I was probably the first car this guy had seen in an hour. Still, there&#8217;s something about the actinic glare of the light that&#8217;s oddly attractive. Plus I didn&#8217;t have anything else to do while I waited around for my lane to open up, so I figured I might as well take some pictures.</p>

    <p>A few days ago President Trump held a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/">rambling press conference</a> in which he promised to do something about Social Security taxes. He&#8217;s already signed an executive action that (if it passes muster in the courts) would defer all payroll taxes through December but then require them to be paid back in a lump sum in January. So one thing he wants to do is forgive the repayment. But then there was more. Trump started to blather about &#8220;extending&#8221; the payroll tax deferral. Finally, apparently unable to stop himself, he went further and promised to permanently reduce or even terminate the payroll tax. Later in the day, his campaign made that promise explicit:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">President <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a>: If I am victorious on November 3rd I plan to make permanent cuts to the payroll tax <a href="https://t.co/7N0D0o4A18">pic.twitter.com/7N0D0o4A18</a></p>
<p>— Team Trump (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TeamTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1292200472837795843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As with most things, your best bet in this case is to ignore everything Trump says. It&#8217;s just meaningless chatter that even Trump himself probably doesn&#8217;t understand. But guess what? In this case, he&#8217;s accidentally stumbled onto a great idea.</p>
<p>You see, we <em>should</em> terminate the payroll tax. It&#8217;s regressive, it&#8217;s pointless, and it long ago stopped serving its original purpose. We should get rid of it and simply fund Social Security out of general tax revenues, just like everything else. Why should it have a less reliable funding source than the Pentagon, after all?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that. Get rid of the payroll tax and increase the personal and corporate income taxes to make up the revenue. At the same time, we can make a bonfire out of the bonds in the Social Security trust fund, televised on national TV for everyone to see. There would be no more ridiculous talk about Social Security &#8220;going bankrupt&#8221; or endless arguments about whether the trust fund is &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;fully funded over the 75-year window.&#8221; When it&#8217;s all over, we&#8217;d pay for Social Security (and Medicare) the same way everything else is paid for: through general purpose taxes. This would save Social Security and Medicare and ensure their full funding forever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad this was just Trump blather. If he were serious about it, it would have been a great idea.</p>

    <p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been nine years since Apple introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop">AirDrop</a> as a part of Mac OS X Lion and iOS 7. I consider AirDrop to be one of Apple’s best moves of the past decade. It’s a feature I have used hundreds of times and have come to rely on to quickly exchange files and other information with my own devices and with the devices used by my friends and family.</p>
<p>But just because AirDrop is useful doesn’t mean it couldn’t be better. In fact, I would argue that it’s been largely ignored the last few years, and could stand some major upgrades that would benefit users of iPhones, iPads, and Macs alike.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3570779/airdrop-is-great-for-the-iphone-ipad-and-mac-but-it-can-be-even-better-heres-how.html">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><em><strong>Posted Wednesday morning, August 12, 2020.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><em><strong> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be407ed2a200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Poets and Writers Tom Wolfe circa 1970 Sam Falk NYT - Edited" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451be5969e2026be407ed2a200d img-responsive" src="https://lancemannion.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451be5969e2026be407ed2a200d-640wi" style="width: 640px;" title="Poets and Writers Tom Wolfe circa 1970 Sam Falk NYT - Edited" /></a><br /></strong></em></p>
<h5><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tom Wolfe in New York City circa 1970. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/obituaries/tom-wolfe-pyrotechnic-nonfiction-writer-and-novelist-dies-at-88.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sam Falk/The New York Times.</a></span></h5>
<p>I used to be a Tom Wolfe fan. Back in the day. Then I caught on to his act. After that, he became a bore, and I stopped reading him. When he died two years ago, I felt I owed him some appreciation, so I tried to force my way through <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/back-to-blood-tom-wolfe/1013623898?ean=9780316036337" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Back to Blood”</a>. I liked it---up until I didn’t, which was about a third of a way in. The other day, though, I started to re-read “Radical Chic”. It came up in the book Ken Mannion and I have been listening to, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/days-of-rage-bryan-burrough/1120553118?ean=9780143107972&amp;aug=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Days of Rage”</a> by Bryan Burrough. So I decided to give it a re-read. It’s not boring. It’s annoying. But, you know, when he stopped posing, the man could write. And he could always get off a snappy line…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...by 1965---as in 1935, as in 1926, as in 1866, as in 1820---New York has had two societies, “Old New York” and “New Society”. In every era, “Old New York” has taken a horrified look at “New Society” and expressed the devout conviction that a genuine aristocracy, good blood, good bone---themselves---was being defiled by a horde of climbers...In the 1960’s, this quaint belief was magnified by the fact that many members of “New Society,” for the first time, were not Protestant. The names and addresses of “Old New York” were to be found in the Social Register...It was and still is, an almost exclusively a roster of Protestant families. Today, however, the Social Register’s annual shuffle, in which errant socialites...are dropped from [that roster], hardly even rates a yawn. The fact is that “Old New York”---except for those members who figure in “New Society”, e.g. [New York State’s Governor] Nelson Rockefeller...is no longer good copy, and without publicity it has <em>never</em> been easy to rank as a fashionable person in New York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well,<em> I</em> thought it was snappy.</p>

<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been less than a year since Apple launched <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-web-based-music-app-as-public-beta/" rel="noopener noreferrer">its first public beta of the Apple Music web player</a>, which after several months came out of beta earlier this year and resides at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>. On the heels of an updated Music app in this fall&rsquo;s releases of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and more, the company isn&rsquo;t delaying keeping its web player in-sync with the app versions. A new public beta of Apple Music for web can be accessed now at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, sporting a design to match the changes seen in the forthcoming macOS 11 and iPadOS 14, and a new Listen Now page that replaces the prior For You option.</p>
<p id="p3">The design refresh doesn&rsquo;t bring major changes, just aesthetic tweaks to elements like the sidebar. Listen Now represents the most substantial update, but it still works similarly to the former For You page. It contains collections of recommended albums and playlists based on your listening activity, alongside Apple Music&rsquo;s algorithmic playlists like New Music Mix and Chill Mix. You&rsquo;ll also find Recently Played, New Releases from artists in your Library, and a new prominent section called Top Picks. After using Listen Now in the OS betas for the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve grown to prefer it over For You, despite there being relatively few differences between the two. Having Top Picks front and center, for example, is a better choice for me than For You&rsquo;s placement of the algorithmic playlists up top, since I rarely listen to those.</p>
<p id="p4">It&rsquo;s great to see that Apple Music&rsquo;s web player will be updated on the same cycle as its apps. Apple&rsquo;s history with iterating its web apps isn&rsquo;t great (iCloud.com, anyone?), but to better compete against Spotify, which has a first-class web player, a more intentional approach for Apple Music is needed.</p>
<p id="p5">Anyone can access the beta version of Apple Music&rsquo;s web player at <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta.music.apple.com</a>, while the previous version is still accessible at <a href="https://music.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">music.apple.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Justin Kroll and Mike Fleming Jr., reporting for Deadline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two and one-half months after it stepped up to become the
producers of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, Apple has inked a
first-look deal with its director, Martin Scorsese. The master
filmmaker will base his Sikelia Productions banner at Apple in a
multi-year deal for film and television projects Scorsese will
produce and direct for Apple TV +.</p>

<p>The relationship kicks off with <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, the
Eric Roth-scripted adaptation of the David Grann non-fiction book
which will star Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro will star in.
Apple won an auction with the $180 million+ film originally
optioned by Paramount came back on the market. Deadline revealed
on May 27 that Apple won a deal that has Paramount releasing the
film theatrically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to apply Apple’s “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">the best, not the most</a>” mantra to Hollywood would be signing more deals like this. Apple TV+ will never have the most exclusive movies and TV shows, but it can have a large share of the <em>best</em> ones.</p>

    <p>Literally the last sentence in <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-lays-off-250-employees-while-it-refocuses-on-commercial-products/">this article</a> about Mozilla laying off a quarter of its employees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Google deal has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla’s revenue, and without it experts see a dim future for Mozilla past 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First: I thought news articles were supposed to be “inverted pyramid,” not “pyramid.”</p>
<p>Second: Nothing gets past those experts, does it?</p>

    <p>David Sparks <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/8/blogging-from-space">wrote an article in VR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I recently tried out a new Oculus app that is intriguing. <a href="https://immersedvr.com/">The app is called <em>Immersed</em></a>, and it is quite a trip. With the app on your Oculus Quest and the host software loaded on your Mac, you can have your Mac’s monitor appear in virtual space. They have a lot of options ranging from an alpine cabin, to a “productivity cave”, to a starship. I am currently orbiting the planet Earth on a starship while I compose this blog post. We just flew over Mexico.

<p>This is weird and I’m not sure it makes any sense, but it sure is an interesting application of VR tech.</p><p><a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/8/blogging-from-space">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/blogging-from-space/">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>
