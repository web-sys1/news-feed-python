    <p>Regarding the Unreal Engine part of the Epic v. Apple legal battle, Microsoft Xbox executive Kevin Gammill filed a declaration for Epic over the weekend. I’m a little surprised Microsoft waded into this at all, but read Gammill’s declaration — it’s only three pages and very cogent. All his declaration states is that Apple revoking Epic’s license to develop Unreal Engine for Apple platforms would be bad for Epic and bad for all games that use Unreal Engine to target iOS or MacOS. Basically: duh. It doesn’t even contain the terms “Fortnite” or “App Store”.</p>

<p>This doesn’t contradict <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/08/sweeney_hand_waving_game_consoles_app_stores">my prediction</a> that you won’t see Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo file amicus briefs on Epic’s behalf about the App Store’s control over software and mandatory use of Apple’s payment system. If Apple hadn’t threatened to revoke the developer program license for Unreal Engine, Microsoft wouldn’t have piped in here.</p>

    <p>Just a quick reminder: presidential candidates often get poll bounces after their conventions. Sometimes it&#8217;s small, sometimes it&#8217;s a little better than that. But in virtually every case, the bounces go away a couple of weeks after both conventions have been held. So don&#8217;t get either excited or worried if either Trump or Biden go either up or down by the end of this week. By September it will all be gone.</p>

    <p>Ezra Klein, writing for Vox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have covered American politics for two decades and never have I
seen a party more ferociously committed to supporting whatever it
is their leader tells them to support.</p>

<p>The problem for Republicans is that the main thing Trump has told
them to support is himself. There are no detailed policy
proposals, much less a coherent ideology or set of governing
principles. And so speech after speech followed the same template:
How was America going to stop the coronavirus? By reelecting
Donald Trump. How was it going to revive its economy? By
reelecting Donald Trump. How was it going to ensure domestic
harmony? By reelecting Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The contradiction at the heart of the convention, of course, is
that Donald Trump is currently president. I’m dead serious. How
would reelecting Trump resolve these crises that Trump has proven
unable to resolve — and has, in many cases, worsened — in
office? No one even took a shot at that Rubik’s cube. Instead, the
speakers awkwardly talked around the fact of Trump’s incumbency.
He was presented, strangely, as both incumbent and challenger; the
man who had fixed America’s problems, but also the man needed to
fix an America beset by more problems than ever.</p>

    <p>If you watched day one of the Republican National Convention last night, you surely remember Kimberly Guilfoyle’s speech. If you didn’t watch but read about the convention, you probably heard about it. But you really should watch it. It is… something. It’s worth noting that Guilfoyle’s speech wasn’t live — they recorded this and either this was the <em>good</em> take or it was one and done and they thought this was good to go.</p>

<p>Angry, screaming, jingoistic speeches are not new to Republican conventions. Proto-Trump white nationalist <a href="https://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148">Pat Buchanan delivered a speech in 1992</a> about which the late <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Molly_Ivins_Letters_to_The_Nation/dlGDAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=molly+ivins+pat+buchanan+original+german&amp;pg=PT48&amp;printsec=frontcover">Molly Ivins famously quipped</a>, “it probably sounded better in the original German”. But at least Buchanan’s speech was coherent. One needn’t agree with the style or the substance to agree that it at least <em>had</em> substance. Guilfoyle’s speech, removed from her histrionic delivery, was pure authoritarian pablum. <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kimberly-guilfoyle-2020-rnc-speech-transcript">Just read the transcript</a>. Mother Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/MotherJones/status/1298089911954714624">set Guilfoyle’s speech to North Korean propaganda music</a> and it works perfectly. This isn’t preaching to the choir; it’s screaming at one’s fellow fundamentalists.</p>

<p>You really have to see it.</p>

<p>If you are an iOS developer and you see copies of your app in the App Store, it is now your job to monitor the store for such copies and alert Apple, otherwise your entire developer account is at risk.</p>
<p>Ironically, I know of at least one case where the developer rightfully pointed out copyright violations of their app in the App Store, but in the end Apple banned their account because they couldn&rsquo;t figure out who was the developer of the original app. &#x1F643;</p></blockquote>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s iOS rules would not have allowed for the invention of the web browser. Let that sink in. They would have rejected one of the most important technical innovations in the history of computing. Microsoft&lsquo;s bully tactic of making IE free seems quaint in comparison.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker: think of all the other amazing ideas that haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to be invented because they aren&rsquo;t allowed on mobile devices. Mosaic happened less than 10 years after the Macintosh. We very well might have already had a browser-caliber invention by now.</p>
<p>Just for people asking: the flagrant violations of AppStore policy that web browsers would be rejected for in this hypothetical are:</p>
<p>1) Running outside code<br />
2) Allowing payments that circumvent Apple&rsquo;s IAP<br />
3) Allowing access to NSFW content</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s part of adding high-friction UX for methods that malware authors would use in the past to gather massive amounts of user/confidential information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tradeoff because these features meant to protect users also add friction that make the products harder to use, which makes them harder to sell and more expensive to support. That, plus the delay and uncertainty of being able to get an entitlement, mean that fewer such products will be developed. We&rsquo;ve come a long way from the early days of Mac OS X where the developer tools were included on the disc, and anyone could start writing code and sharing their work with people.</p>

<p>Various Mac operations get <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/05/22/macos-10-15-slow-by-design/">slower</a>, and now I often see UI freezes and high CPU use caused by the security subsystems. There&rsquo;s more potential for bugs, both because of the more complicated interaction between apps and the OS and because of problems with the OS itself. The steps Wardle describes seem obscure but straightforward enough, once you know them. But that&rsquo;s the happy path. I&rsquo;ve seen countless cases where a security-related file or database got messed up, and it was difficult for the user to fix it because of System Integrity Protection. Sometimes the cause of the wedging remains a mystery, and the only solution seems to be to reinstall macOS.</p>

<p>Development is more complicated because the security stuff is always changing and is often undocumented. New requirements are added in late August, months after the first WWDC build. One of the changes in Big Sur makes it much slower to develop <a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/">my Mail plug-in</a>. Previously, notarization was only necessary when shipping software to customers. Now, I need to notarize the plug-in each time I make a new build to test on my own Mac. In the best case, after writing some scripts to automate the process, this adds a few minutes to each build cycle. Yesterday and this morning, something was wonky with the notarization server, and notarization took almost an hour.</p>

<p>U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Apple can&rsquo;t retaliate against Epic Games by blocking the gaming firm&rsquo;s developer accounts or restrict developers on Apple platforms from accessing the widely used Unreal Engine tools.</p>

Therefore, even if Epic obtained a TRO now, Apple could still try to prevail with respect to Unreal Engine a couple of weeks later--and this goes both ways, so whatever Epic doesn&rsquo;t win immediately, it could still pursue in the next round. The PI hearing has been scheduled for September 28, so the TRO decision will be in effect for about a month.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>With respect to Fortnite, however, the case appears clear to the judge.

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting how bizarre Apple&rsquo;s argument was. They demand their contracts be dealt with as absolutes, but when asked why they are terminating the dev tools contract that isn&rsquo;t breached, they go &ldquo;well we break routinely break contracts when we feel like it&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote cite="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">
<p>The problem for Epic &mdash; and, I suppose, for me &mdash; is that to this observer it seems exceedingly likely that Apple is going to win this case, last night&rsquo;s decision notwithstanding. Current Supreme Court jurisprudence is very clear that businesses &mdash; including monopolies &mdash; have no duty to deal with third parties, and if they do choose to deal with them (or are even compelled to), that they can choose the terms on which to do so. The only exceptions are if the monopoly in question changes the rules in an unprofitable way with the express purpose of driving out a competitor, or if any company &mdash; not even a monopoly &mdash; changes access to after-market parts and services.</p>
<p>In short, what is needed are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">new laws</a> built for the Internet, which is why <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">it was encouraging</a> that Congress is holding hearings about these issues, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">also frustrating</a> that Apple received relatively little attention.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Here is what I believe the App Store has fundamentally wrong: its current organizing principle is digital versus analog; anything that is digital has to have in-app purchase, while anything that is analog &mdash; i.e. connected to the real world &mdash; can monetize however it pleases. [&#8230;] The better organizing principle is whether or not the app developer has marginal costs.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.cerebralgardens.com/blog/entry/2020/08/25/app-store-2"><p>The obvious answer is just to move iOS to a macOS like system but it&rsquo;s just as obvious Apple isn&rsquo;t willing to do that. My proposal is a compromise that I believe offers a fair direction forward for all parties involved.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>More than that, my biggest complaint with Apple is the power they have to decide if another company should be allowed to provide their product/service. They are able to block any app that competes with them (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-apple-rejected-google-voice/">now</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html">in the future</a>), is <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1153337/cameraplus_pulled.html">innovative in any way</a> Apple hadn&rsquo;t considered, or that goes against their <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/apple-rejected-drone-tracker-app-because-could-165357031.html">values</a>. Apple shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to project their values onto their customers.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>The key difference being that Apple accepts anything that isn&rsquo;t illegal or a valid security issue, but not every accepted app gets listed in the App Store. An app that has been accepted, but excluded from the store can be installed by a user that has a direct link provided by Apple upon approval. Side note: this gives Apple a great opportunity to optimize the App Store since they can remove the millions of junk/neglected apps and only present the best apps to users.</p></blockquote>

    </p></div>
    <p>With the Democratic virtual convention now finished, I feel like sharing a mini-essay on American politics in the Trump era. Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll keep it short and the navel gazing to a minimum.</p>
<p>One of the key questions raised by Donald Trump&#8217;s 2016 victory has been whether he represents a new turn in American politics or merely a blip who will be quickly forgotten if he loses in 2020. Over the past four years I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time reviewing the evidence about this, and the conclusion I&#8217;ve come to is pretty simple: Trump is a blip.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s back up a bit. For a very long time Democrats have believed that demographics were on their side. Republicans are acutely dependent on white voters, and every election cycle the share of white voters declines by a percent or two. Since voters of color largely support Democrats, this would someday make it all but impossible for Republicans to win the presidency.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_860979"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 450px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-860979" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_pew_white_voters-1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="1138"></figure>
<p>But when would that day come? The Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-tps16.html">projects</a> that white voters won&#8217;t lose their absolute majority until 2044, but the Republican day of reckoning will come long before that. In fact, my take is that it&#8217;s already happened. It came in 2008, and ever since then it&#8217;s been close to hopeless for a Republican to win the presidency. This makes Donald Trump not a harbinger of things to come, but a final, feral howl of white reactionary politics as a ticket to the White House. He eked out one last victory for the Fox News set not because racism was broadly on the rise, but because of a string of remarkable happenstances: Russian interference; a backlash against eight years of a Black man as president; a woman as his opponent; a last-minute FBI letter; and an unexpected blurp in the Electoral College that placed him in the Oval Office even though he lost the popular vote by millions of votes.</p>
<p>This was a 100:1 shot, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to be duplicated in the near future, regardless of who the Republican and Democratic candidates are. Trump managed to win an improbable victory by squeezing out the very last dregs of white voters in America, but if anything, he&#8217;s made it harder than ever for Republicans to pull this off again. It may be difficult to see this through the Trumpian muck right now, but decent people outnumber racists in America in virtually every demographic group. Trump obviously depends on the support of conservative white voters, but even among this group he&#8217;ll have a hard time winning because there are simply too many conservative white people who have become disgusted by Trump&#8217;s obviously racist appeals.</p>
<p>Two years ago I <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/10/make-democrats-great-again-without-pandering-to-trumps-angry-base/">wrote a piece for the magazine</a> that presented the evidence of a white backlash against eight years of Obama in the White House. It wasn&#8217;t a huge backlash, but it was enough to change the course of the 2016 election when you added it to all the other things that happened in that strangest of all years. And it couldn&#8217;t survive forever once Obama was out of office, which is good news for both Democrats in particular and racial justice more generally. As I wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There’s every reason to think [Democrats] can take aggressive positions on Trump’s odious racial pronouncements and cruel policies.</strong> At the same time, they can take aggressive positions against his widely disliked economic programs and in support of their own increasingly popular ideas—which appeal equally to the working class of all races.</p>

<p>I would say that the events of this year have been the strongest possible test of this thesis. In the wake of the George Floyd killing and the Black Lives Matter protests, Democrats have taken a far more aggressive stand on racial justice issues than anyone would have predicted two years ago. And guess what? It hasn&#8217;t hurt them at the polls. It&#8217;s too early to tell if it&#8217;s actively <em>helped</em> them, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it has. In the same way that 2016 featured a white backlash against a Black man in the White House, 2020 is almost certain to feature a white backlash against an open racist in the White House.¹ Add that to the usual increase in voters of color that we see every four years and American politics will leave Donald Trump in the ashcan of history within days of the November election.</p>
<p>This is an optimistic view of America, and I understand that a lot of people will have a hard time accepting it after the events of the past few years. Hell, there are whole months at a time when I have a hard time accepting it. But America is truly not the cesspool that Donald Trump makes it look like. It&#8217;s fundamentally a decent country with an appalling racial history—but a racial history that we&#8217;ve been slowly overcoming for decades. Trump represents the worst of that history, not the future of our country. The arc of American culture may be slow, but it does bend toward racial justice. Donald Trump is only a few weeks from discovering that.</p>
<p>¹This is, needless to say, a different segment of white voters than the ones who were triggered by the Obama presidency to vote for Trump.</p>

<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/final-cut-pro-x-updated-with-significant-workflow-improvements/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a press release</a> today, Apple announced that it has updated its video editing app Final Cut Pro X to version 10.4.9 as well as Motion and Compressor.</p>
<p id="p3">The update to Final Cut adds several features designed to improve the editing process including:</p>
<ul id="ul4"><li>New tools for cropping video to fit with popular social media formats such as square and vertical video</li>
<li>Improvements to proxy workflows with support for ProRes Proxy and H.264 formats which Apple says can be as small as 12.5% of their original size</li>
<li>Linking to proxies generated by apps like Frame.io via XML</li>
<li>Exposure of ProRes RAW camera settings in Final Cut Pro&rsquo;s inspector</li>
<li>Metal-based plug-ins for RED RAW and Canon Cinema RAW Light, which improve performance</li>
<li>Improvements to 360-degree video workflows</li>
</ul><p id="p5">With Motion, third-party 3D models are now available when creating effects and graphics. The app also adds a new customizable Stroke Filter that can automatically outline an object or text using its alpha channel. Compressor has been updated too with custom LUT effects and the ability to convert log-encoded video to SDR or HDR footage using Camera LUTs.</p>
<p id="p6">I&rsquo;m a fairly light user of Final Cut Pro X, but one of the things that I found most frustrating about it in the past was the app&rsquo;s lack of support for popular social media formats, so I&rsquo;m glad to see that creating square and vertical video will be easier now. I expect that many video creators will be equally happy with the improvements to proxy workflows and integration with cloud-based apps like Frame.io, which has become very popular.</p>
<p id="p7">The updates are free for existing users. New users can purchase Final Cut Pro X for $299.99 and Motion and Compressor for $49.99 each on the Mac App Store. The three apps are also available as a bundle to education users for $199.99. More information about the updates is available on <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s Final Cut Pro X webpage</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other piece of hardware you can put in the “upgrade”-with-scare-quotes category is the Pixel 5’s Snapdragon 765G SoC. The Pixel 4 has a Snapdragon 855 SoC, and since Qualcomm chips perform similarly no matter what phone is built around them, we don’t need device-specific benchmarks to know the Pixel 5 will be slower than the Pixel 4. […] With the Pixel 5, Google is making a transition from a flagship device to a midrange phone, which leads to awkward comparisons like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plastic back too, supposedly. If all of this is true, what phone is someone supposed to buy if they want top-shelf hardware and the pure no-junk Android experience?</p>

<p>It seems appropriate that <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.48.0.pdf">the first ruling</a> in Epic v. Apple was a split decision: Fortnite remains out of the App Store,<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/#footnote_0_5238" id="identifier_0_5238" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Fortnite still works if you have previously downloaded it; the judge&rsquo;s order does suggest that Apple could render Fortnite (and only Fortnite) completely unplayable if it chose to">1</a> but Epic may continue to use Apple&#8217;s developer tools <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-follow-up-a-brief-history-of-epic-games-apples-hammer/">in order to support Unreal Engine</a>.</p>
<h4>Apple v. Epic</h4>
<p>The truth is that, from a philosophical perspective, both Epic and Apple make valid points. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/7/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">an email to Apple</a> announcing that Epic was offering its own payment processor in Fortnite, that this case was about the freedom to use your smartphone in whatever way you wished:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We choose to follow this path in the firm belief that history and law are on our side. Smartphones are essential computing devices that people use to live their lives and conduct their business. Apple&#8217;s position that its manufacture of a device gives it free rein to control, restrict, and tax commerce by consumers and creative expression by developers is repugnant to the principles of a free society. Ending these restrictions will benefit consumers in the form of lower prices, increased product selection, and business model innovation…</p>
<p>  We hope that Apple will reflect on its platform restrictions and begin to make historic changes that bring to the world’s billion iOS consumers the rights and freedoms enjoyed on the world&#8217;s leading open computing platforms including Windows and macOS.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, in a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">declaration to the court</a>, argued Apple&#8217;s approach gave users a different sort of freedom, that of having entrusted Apple to deliver an excellent user experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The App Store’s monetization model is rooted in Apple’s overall philosophy of putting the user and user experience first. This focus on user experience is reflected in Apple’s overall business model and offerings to consumers, which prioritize quality (e.g., distinctive design, innovative technology), security (e.g., protection from malware), and privacy (e.g., safeguarding of personal and payment data). This philosophy can also be seen in Apple’s strategy of integrating its proprietary hardware, software, and services across the range of its products to ensure a high quality user experience, in contrast to many of its competitors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiller&#8217;s declaration included <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/37/5/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">a letter from Apple&#8217;s Associate General Counsel</a> that explained how this approach benefited developers, including Epic:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Because of Apple’s rules and efforts, iOS and the App Store are widely recognized as providing the most secure consumer technology on the planet. And as a result, consumers can download and pay for an app and in-app content without worrying that it might break their device, steal their information, or rip them off. This level of security benefits developers by providing them with an active and engaged marketplace for their apps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">I noted last week</a>, there is a lot of credence to Apple&#8217;s claims, particularly when it comes to the size of the app market; while the convenience and accessibility of smartphones are the more important reason why iOS and Android are far larger markets than the Windows and macOS platforms Sweeney wishes iOS would emulate, the confidence users have in installing smartphone apps far exceeds the confidence they have doing the same on traditional PCs. That confidence, it should be noted, is well placed: the likelihood of installing malware or performance-destroying applications on your smartphone is far less than on even modern Windows and macOS computers, much less those back in the 2000s when the App Store first launched.</p>
<p>This was something that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs was very focused on; he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/technology/12apple.html">New York Times</a> in 2007:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We define everything that is on the phone,” he said. “You don’t want your phone to be like a PC. The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore. These are more like iPods than they are like computers”…</p>
<p>  “These are devices that need to work, and you can’t do that if you load any software on them,” he said. “That doesn’t mean there’s not going to be software to buy that you can load on them coming from us. It doesn’t mean we have to write it all, but it means it has to be more of a controlled environment.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, everything is a trade-off, and the fact that iOS is so much more important in 2020 than it was in 2008 raises the costs inherent in Apple&#8217;s model. Smartphones are not adjuncts to computers, like iPods were; they are the primary computer for nearly everyone, including those that might invent the future. Francisco Tolmasky, who was on the original iPhone team, noted <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1297199788316692480">on Twitter</a>:</p>
<div align="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">But here’s the kicker: think of all the other amazing ideas that haven’t gotten a chance to be invented because they aren’t allowed on mobile devices. Mosaic happened less than 10 years after the Macintosh. We very well might have already had a browser-caliber invention by now.</p>
<p>&mdash; Francisco Tolmasky (@tolmasky) <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1297200613403459586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This is the chief reason why, if I had to choose a victor in this case, I would choose Epic; Apple is a brilliant company, but they hardly have a monopoly on invention and innovation. My overriding concern is that their monopoly on iOS (and duopoly with Google, which copies many of their App Store practices) will prevent the invention and innovation of others.</p>
<p>The problem for Epic — and, I suppose, for me — is that to this observer it seems exceedingly likely that Apple is going to win this case, last night&#8217;s decision notwithstanding. Current Supreme Court jurisprudence is very clear that businesses — including monopolies — have no duty to deal with third parties,<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/#footnote_1_5238" id="identifier_1_5238" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP.">2</a> and if they do choose to deal with them (or are even compelled to), that they can choose the terms on which to do so.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/#footnote_2_5238" id="identifier_2_5238" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc..">3</a> The only exceptions are if the monopoly in question changes the rules in an unprofitable way with the express purpose of driving out a competitor<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/#footnote_3_5238" id="identifier_3_5238" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Aspen Skiing v. Aspen Highlands Skiing; this case may apply to Apple&rsquo;s removal of parental control apps that leveraged mobile device management capabilities.">4</a>, or if any company — not even a monopoly — changes access to after-market parts and services<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/#footnote_4_5238" id="identifier_4_5238" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., of which the dissent is the de facto controlling precedent.">5</a></p>
<p>In short, what is needed are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">new laws</a> built for the Internet, which is why <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">it was encouraging</a> that Congress is holding hearings about these issues, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">also frustrating</a> that Apple received relatively little attention.</p>
<h4>WordPress and Hey</h4>
<p>The nature of the limited exceptions above are one reason Apple is at pains to emphasize that the App Store rules have been the same from the beginning; this is mostly correct, although the company has certainly tightened the limits around in-app purchasing over the years, to the extent that companies with cross-platform offerings can&#8217;t even tell users that they can subscribe on the web. It also seems that the App Store is going further than that; consider last weekend&#8217;s kerfuffle with the WordPress app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088">tweeted</a> that Apple was refusing to allow updates to the WordPress app until it implemented in-app purchase for WordPress.com.</li>
<li>The problem for Automattic is that the WordPress app is designed for not only WordPress.com, but also all open source WordPress sites (the app itself is distributed with the non-App-Store-compatible <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">General Public License</a>; Automattic has a special license from the <a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>, which owns the WordPress copyrights, to submit a version compatible with the App Store). This meant that Apple was demanding that an app meant to service all WordPress sites, including those on WordPress.com, add in-app purchases for just one of those sites.</li>
<li>After 24 hours of confusion and outcry (including from <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1296889185190596608">me</a>), Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app">reversed its decision</a> and &#8220;apologized for any confusion that [they] caused&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems likely that the dual nature of the WordPress app — both adjunct to the for-profit WordPress.com and tool for the open-source WordPress.org project — was the reason Apple reversed its decision (that or bad press); said reasoning, though, means that Apple very much intended to make Automattic add in-app purchase functionality because it felt entitled to the company&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p>This certainly appeared to be the case for Hey.com; while Apple&#8217;s official position in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/interview-apples-schiller-says-position-on-hey-app-is-unchanged-and-no-rules-changes-are-imminent/">written communication to Basecamp</a> was that the app had to add in-app purchase if it did not have free functionality, the final paragraph suggested the company felt it deserved a cut:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thank you for being an iOS app developer. We understand that Basecamp has developed a number of apps and many subsequent versions for the App Store for many years, and that the App Store has distributed millions of these apps to iOS users. These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years. We are happy to continue to support you in your app business and offer you the solutions to provide your services for free — so long as you follow and respect the same App Store Review Guidelines and terms that all developers must follow.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately Basecamp added free functionality (an email address that is only good for two weeks) and didn&#8217;t add in-app purchase, and Apple approved the app; like the WordPress case, though, the question remained: how much did the massive amount of publicity around the case, particularly given the fact this blew up right before Apple&#8217;s annual developer conference, matter?</p>
<h4>App Store Anecdotes</h4>
<p>From what I have seen, quite a bit. When the Hey.com rejection happened, <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1273079296618201093">I wondered on Twitter</a> if Apple was blocking other developers from updating their apps unless they added in-app purchase, and was surprised at the response: twenty-one app developers who contacted me had added in-app purchase in the last twelve months, and all of the developers in that list with regular update schedules had significant gaps in their history of updates (for example, one app updated every two weeks, with a four-month interruption in the middle of 2019). Nine more had either committed to adding in-app purchase, still had their app in limbo, or had simply given up on the App Store.</p>
<p>What was striking about all of these apps is that only three of them functioned primarily on an iPhone; in the vast majority of cases Apple was demanding in-app purchase offerings for functionality that was largely <em>not</em> dependent on an iPhone:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 of the apps were &#8220;Companion Apps&#8221;, many of them in the business-to-business category. Imagine, for example, there was a service that allowed you to track inventory, and that service had a mobile app that let you look up your inventory numbers from your phone; Apple held up updates until the iPhone app had an in-app purchase option for the entire service (this is a fake example, but is representative). There were also some apps that looked a lot like the WordPress app: easier access to a web service (like a blog) that could just as easily have used a web page.</li>
<li>6 of the apps were &#8220;Cross-platform Web Services&#8221;; in this case iPhone access was certainly essential, but only because said service had to work everywhere. Think Hey&#8217;s email service, but, well, <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/apple-app-store-antitrust/">other email services</a>, none of whom appear to have achieved Hey&#8217;s favorable outcome.</li>
<li>4 of the apps offered marketplace-type of functionality for things like classes, coaching, therapists, etc. Two examples are Airbnb and ClassPass, which the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/apple-app-store-airbnb-classpass.html">New York Times</a> wrote about last month.</li>
<li>3 of the apps were purely digital goods, 1 was a niche streaming video app (that for whatever reason did not fall under the &#8220;reader&#8221; exemption), and 1 was a hardware app.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have sat on these anecdotes for several months now, in part because this is all I can say: none of the developers were willing to go on the record for fear of angering Apple. What I think the WordPress and Hey episodes show, though, is that these are the exact sort of apps where Apple is getting things wrong, at least as far as popular opinion is concerned. Epic, what with its costumes and emotes that have zero marginal costs and only ever exist within the virtual world that Fornite created, is in many respects the worst possible agent for App Store change.</p>
<h4>Organizing Principles</h4>
<p>Here is what I believe the App Store has fundamentally wrong: its current organizing principle is digital versus analog; anything that is digital has to have in-app purchase, while anything that is analog — i.e. connected to the real world — can monetize however it pleases. That is why Amazon or Uber can ask for your credit card, and Airbnb can do the same for rooms but not for digital experiences (according to Apple).</p>
<p>The problem with this organizing principle is found in &#8220;Reader&#8221; app exception; from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>3.1.3(a) “Reader” Apps:</strong> Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as classroom management apps), provided that you agree not to directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods are not designed to discourage use of in-app purchase.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how you end up with Netflix or Spotify or Kindle having apps that open to a login screen with zero indication about how to sign up for an account; most users probably figure out to go to their websites, but it is hardly a good experience from anyone&#8217;s perspective, and lesser known apps are likely to simply lose potential customers. At the same time, though, you can understand why &#8220;Reader&#8221; apps don&#8217;t really have a choice: Kindle has to pay publishers for books, and Spotify music labels; layering on 30% simply isn&#8217;t feasible.</p>
<p>The better organizing principle is whether or not the app developer has marginal costs. If every incremental sale costs the developer money, then Apple should not only not charge 30%, but should in fact compete for that purchase. Consider, for example, the ClassPass example in that New York Times article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ClassPass built its business on helping people book exercise classes at local gyms. So when the pandemic forced gyms across the United States to close, the company shifted to virtual classes. Then ClassPass received a concerning message from Apple. Because the classes it sold on its iPhone app were now virtual, Apple said it was entitled to 30 percent of the sales, up from no fee previously, according to a person close to ClassPass who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting Apple. The iPhone maker said it was merely enforcing a decade-old rule…</p>
<p>  With gyms shut down, ClassPass dropped its typical commission on virtual classes, passing along 100 percent of sales to gyms, the person close to the company said. That meant Apple would have taken its cut from hundreds of struggling independent fitness centers, yoga studios and boxing gyms.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, Apple should both allow ClassPass to sell its classes via a webview (i.e. loading a webpage within its app), and also offer in-app purchases for, say, 10%; yes, that&#8217;s more expensive than credit card processing fees (which are ~$0.30+2.5%~2.9%, or around 6% of a $10 purchase), but the superiority of the user experience may convert enough customers that ClassPass would consider it worth the expense. This should also apply to all of the apps in the &#8220;Reader&#8221; category.</p>
<p>Fortnite, on the other hand, like most games, is selling purely virtual goods that have zero marginal cost; a costume or emote are bits in a database. Epic may be right that Apple&#8217;s 30% take is higher than it would be if the App Store had competition, but ultimately the cost of Fortnite&#8217;s V-Bucks is a completely arbitrary one (that is why, for example, Fortnite was willing to cut the price of V-Bucks on consoles to make their App Store point, even though they were still paying 30% to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo). To the extent that the App Store tax must exist — and to be clear, this is all predicated on the assumption that it isn&#8217;t going anywhere — purely digital goods, particularly those that are only usable on Apple&#8217;s platform, are the least objectionable.</p>
<p>This does, I should note, apply to more categories of apps than games. Many productivity apps are zero marginal cost — they are simply infinitely replicable software — and Apple&#8217;s take is reducing profitability, as opposed to making individual sales unviable. Indeed, I have always been less concerned about the 30% take for productivity apps and more focused on <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">the lack of traditional trials and paid updates</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a distinction worth drawing between experiences that primarily happen on an iPhone, and those that are primarily on the web, or cross-platform. The latter should be allowed the current &#8220;Reader&#8221; exception: simply present a login, because, by definition, the user is already using the application in question elsewhere. It is absolutely bizarre that Apple is going after these apps to demand in-app purchase; the fact these developers bothered to make an iPhone app as an add-on is the real win, and punishing them is counter-productive.</p>
<p>Distinguishing apps according to their iPhone-centricity and marginal costs results in a landscape that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1-1024x767.png" alt="A new App Store framework" width="640" height="479" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5239" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1-1024x767.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1-300x225.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1-768x575.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1-841x630.png 841w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/appstore-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>iPhone-focused experiences with zero marginal cost goods pay the full in-app purchase tax, while cross-platform experiences are allowed only a login. Apps with marginal costs, meanwhile, can either offer their own payment solution via a webview, or take advantage of the App Store&#8217;s superior in-app purchase experience at a competitive rate.</p>
<h4>A New App Store Approach</h4>
<p>I know this Article has been wide-ranging, but there is a reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, while I recognize there are good reasons for Apple&#8217;s approach to the App Store, in a vacuum I would prefer far more openness and freedom, primarily for the sake of increased innovation.</li>
<li>Second, under current law, I expect Apple to retain total control of the App Store.</li>
<li>Third, I believe that Apple&#8217;s current approach to the App Store is bad for developers, bad for innovation, and ultimately bad for Apple.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points are important; it is tempting to write a screed about the App Store that ignores point two, for example, which means the screed doesn&#8217;t matter; at the same time, I am concerned that Apple itself will ignore point three, and miss an opportunity to rethink its approach.</p>
<p>That, then, is the spirit of my proposals: if we accept the fact that Apple is determined to make a significant amount of money off of the App Store, and that they have the right to do so, what is a better approach? For this I will incorporate all of the above, and also draw on the distinctions I made to discrete App Store functionality <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">last week</a> (and again, let me be very clear: this isn&#8217;t my preferred outcome, but rather one that I hope is plausible).</p>
<p><strong>App Installation:</strong> Apple should stop using App Installation to stifle new business models like Google Stadia or Xbox Game Pass. This is, admittedly, one of my weaker arguments in terms of getting Apple&#8217;s buy-in: I believe Apple should allow these because innovation is important, and cloud gaming is exactly that. At the same time, cloud gaming is a direct challenge to Apple&#8217;s App Store control, so I understand why 30% is not enough from Apple&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> This is where the marginal cost/cross-platform distinction comes into play:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your app experience is contained to the iPhone and has zero marginal costs, you can only use in-app purchase at Apple&#8217;s rate (30% currently).</li>
<li>If your app experience is cross-platform and has zero marginal costs, your app can simply be a login page at launch, with the assumption you are paying elsewhere; if you wish to offer payments, you have to offer in-app purchase at Apple&#8217;s rate.</li>
<li>If your app experience has marginal costs, then you can offer either a webview for purchase or an in-app purchase at a new Apple rate (~10%) (keep in mind that marginal costs means something discrete; simply needing some indeterminate amount of more server capacity doesn&#8217;t suffice).</li>
</ul>
<p>There will still be edge cases here, particularly when it comes to determining what is an iPhone-only experience, as opposed to a cross-platform one; Fortnite, for example, can be played cross-platform, but I would still classify it as an iPhone-only experience (I would be ok with simply assuming that all games are iPhone-only experiences). What makes these edge cases far more tolerable, though, is that they are arguing about who gets what share of zero marginal cost goods, as opposed to driving folks who need to pay for what they provide out of business.</p>
<p>In addition, I will never rest in my call for traditional trials and upgrade pricing (and go ahead Apple, take your 30%); it&#8217;s a better model for productivity apps than subscriptions, particularly small-scale apps, and it genuinely bums me out that this doesn&#8217;t yet exist. Indeed, this is the strongest possible argument as to why one company having a monopoly over payment processing is such a terrible idea.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Here Apple both gives and takes. The taking is clear: by virtue of controlling payment, Apple controls the customer relationship. That is a reason for a developer to try and consummate the payment on their own.</p>
<p>At the same time, the App Store is itself a marketing channel. I do believe that Apple massively overstates its importance — sure, it is nice to for an app to be featured, but you can&#8217;t build a business model around that like you can <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/">targeted advertising</a> — but it is a potential value-add. What Apple should do is make discovery in the App Store contingent on using in-app purchase. If you want to be featured or show up in charts use in-app purchase; if you don&#8217;t, then customers have to search for your app directly.</p>
<hr />
<p>The odds are that Apple isn&#8217;t going to change anything; the App Store is extremely profitable, and Apple is probably going to win its court case. Why give up a single dime? At the same time, the constant wave of controversies have to be wearing on the company, from a morale perspective if nothing else. Apple can be legitimately accused of profiteering off of COVID-19!</p>
<p>To that end, I hope the company will at least consider the possibility that this isn&#8217;t the 1990s, they&#8217;re not about to go out of business, and that being perceived as an asset to developers and not a tax opens up the possibility of growing the pie, not simply taking their slice. If that is the outcome of this summer of App Store turmoil, it will be a win for everyone: developers, Apple, and the users that want both security and innovation.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Last night a friend from Vanderbilt, Father John Rickert, sent me a curious math problem. (John was a PhD student in the math department while I was a postdoc. He went on to be a Catholic priest after graduating.) He said that if you look at iterates of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = exp( sin(<em>x</em>) )</p>
<p>the plots become square.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a plot to start the discussion, looking at <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>), <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)), <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>))), and <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)))).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_sin_iter_1.png" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>One thing that is apparent is that there&#8217;s a big difference between applying <em>f</em> once and applying it at least two times. The former can range between 1/<em>e</em> and <em>e</em>, but the latter must be between exp(1/<em>e</em>) and <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>The plots overlap in a way that&#8217;s hard to understand, so let&#8217;s spread them out, plotting one iteration at a time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_sin_iter_2.png" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>Now we can see the plots becoming flatter as the number of iterations increases. We can also see that even and odd iterations are roughly mirror images of each other. This suggests we should make a plot of at just even or just odd iterates. Here we go:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_sin_iter_3.png" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>This shows more clearly how the plots are squaring off pretty quickly as the number of iterations increases.</p>
<p>My first thought when John showed me his plot was that it must have something to do with the contraction mapping theorem. And I suppose it does, but not in a simple way. The function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is not a contraction mapping for any <em>x</em>. But <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)) is a contraction mapping for some <em>x</em>, and further iterates are contractions for more values of <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>My second thought was that it would be interesting to look at the Fourier transform of these iterates. For any finite number of iterations, the result is a periodic, analytic function, and so eventually the Fourier coefficients must go to zero rapidly. But I suspect they initially go to zero slowly, like those of a square wave would. I intend to update this post after I&#8217;ve had a chance to look at the Fourier coefficients.</p>
<p>Update: As expected, the Fourier coefficients decay slowly. I plotted the Fourier sine coefficients for <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)))) using Mathematica.</p>
<pre>
    f[x_] := Exp[Sin[x]]
    g[x_] := f[f[f[f[x]]]]
    ListPlot[ Table[
        NFourierSinCoefficient[g[x], x, i], 
        {i, 30}]
    ]
</pre>
<p>This produced the plot below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.johndcook.com/exp_sin_iter_4.png" width="480" height="294" class="aligncenter size-medium" /></p>
<p>The even-numbered coefficients are zero, but the odd-numbered coefficients are going to zero very slowly. Since the function <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) is infinitely differentiable, for any <em>k</em> you can go far enough out in the Fourier series that the coefficients go to zero faster than <em>n</em><sup>&#8211;<em>k</em></sup>. But initially the Fourier coefficients decay like 1/<em>n</em>, which is typical of a discontinuous function, like a square wave, rather than an infinitely differentiable function.</p>
<p>By the way, if you replace sine with cosine, you get similar plots, but with half as many flat spots per period.</p>

    <p>Russell Brandom, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday, Epic Games and Apple faced off in the first hearing of
their ongoing legal fight, held in a public Zoom call because of
the ongoing quarantine restrictions. The hearing sought to
determine whether Epic’s developer privileges should be legally
protected — initially by a temporary restraining order, setting
the stage for a more powerful preliminary injunction that would
remain in force for the duration of the trial.</p>

<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not issue an immediate ruling on
the issue, but said she would be issuing a written order after the
fact “and I will issue it quickly.”</p>

<p>However, Judge Rogers opened the hearing by indicating she was
likely to take action to protect the Unreal Engine, but let the
Fortnite ban stand. “I am not inclined to grant relief with
respect to the games,” the judge said, “but I am inclined to grant
relief with respect to the Unreal Engine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effectively, Apple’s threat to revoke all of Epic’s Apple Developer Program memberships — not just the account for the subsidiary behind Fortnite but also that of the subsidiary behind Unreal Engine — has made this into two cases: the main part regarding Fortnite and the iOS App Store, and a second part regarding Unreal Engine and all Apple platforms.</p>

<p>Judge Rogers’s take sounds right for now: in Apple’s favor regarding Fortnite, and in Epic’s favor regarding Unreal Engine.</p>

<p>For good play-by-play livestream coverage of the hearing, I suggest reading <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/1298020443182440449">Sarah Jeong’s thread on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/48/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">Judge Rogers ruled exactly as she was inclined</a>. Seems fair, and the ruling’s “background” section is an excellent, accurate, and fair assessment of the saga to date.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Henrique Prange, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop using 6-digit iPhone passcodes! Do you think I am overly
paranoid? Keep reading.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of mine had his iPhone stolen. What follows
is the sequence of events that started as an unfortunate event
and ended up with $30,000 in unauthorized wire transfers, $2,500
spent on the AppStore, and accounts of multiple services
compromised. […]</p>

<p>So, how could the wrongdoers do all of that in less than 5 hours?
After considering many options, the only reasonable explanation is
they cracked the 6-digit passcode on the stolen iPhone using some
kind of device like the GrayKey.</p>

<p>The passcode gave them access to the keychain. They searched for
the iCloud credentials, disabled the Lost Mode, and turned off the
Find My.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting but alarming story. Did the thieves crack his 6-digit passcode with a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/graykey">GrayKey</a> or GrayKey-like device? Impossible to say. But it’s worth thinking about it. We know GrayKey exists, and if it exists, thieves could have it. It’s also easier for a would-be thief to snoop a target entering a 6-digit passcode than an alphanumeric passphrase.</p>

<p>I mention this in the wake of the aforelinked piece on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/24/face-id-vs-face-masks">Face ID vs. face masks</a> because months ago, when I first started grocery shopping while wearing a mask, I switched my iPhone from an alphanumeric passphrase back to a 6-digit passcode for convenience. I did so thinking, basically, that even though a 6-digit passcode is less secure, anything truly dangerous like disabling Find My iPhone requires my iCloud password as well.</p>

<p>It simply never occurred to me that if a thief (or law enforcement, or any adversary) has the device passcode, and your iCloud password is in your keychain, they can get your iCloud password from your keychain. All you need is the device passcode to access <em>all</em> of the passwords in iCloud keychain. Try it — you can.</p>

<p>So I’m back on an alphanumeric passphrase, inconvenience while wearing a mask be damned. Remember too: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/20/how-modern-iphone-encryption-works">you don’t need to make an alphanumeric device passphrase long or complicated to make it very secure</a> — a 6-character alphanumeric passphrase would take on average 72 years to crack by brute force because it takes 80-milliseconds for the secure enclave to process each guess.</p>

<p>Republican convention starts tonight.</p>
<p><em>Tell us something we don’t know, Lance.</em></p>
<p>Ok. Let me tell you this...</p>
<p>Don’t watch.</p>
<p>Unless you’re being paid to, give the whole four nights the skip.</p>
<p>Don’t follow it on Twitter either. There’s no point. And it won’t do you any good. Republicans don’t care what we think. They like it when we sputter in outrage and dismay. And you’ll only be helping him. You’ll be telling the networks there’s money in covering him as if he’s a regular Presidential candidate with your impressions, clicks, and eyeballs. You’ll be adding to his ratings, and you know important those are to him. He’ll lie and brag no matter what, but at least you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you didn’t contribute. And he wins by getting into your head and poisoning your soul. If all you’re going to do is tweet your anger and fear, paranoia and despair, you’re doing his work for him.</p>
<p>Watch a movie. Watch basketball. Binge watch a TV show. Read a book. Write some letters. Talk to friends and relations in person, if you can, by phone or on whatever device that’s handiest for you. Take a long walk, if you can. If you can, sit outside and look at the stars. If you have any left, shoot off some fireworks, although I and your neighbors really wish you wouldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>If romance is a possibility, make it a night of romance. Throw yourself a party, even if it has to be a party of one.</p>
<p>If you can’t resist the lure of social media, remember that most people online aren’t here to obsess over politics and there’s lots going on that’s interesting, informative, and fun. Like on my blog. I don&#39;t write just about politics, you know. <a href="https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fer inskinks.</a></p>
<p>If you can&#39;t help yourself, whatever you do, don&#39;t watch it on one of the major networks or follow it via their newsfeeds. They&#39;re going to &quot;report&quot; on it and &quot;analyze&quot; it as if it&#39;s not all lies in service of re-electing a criminal lunatic , proven incompetent, and unabashed racist president. C-SPAN, MSNBC, and Amazon Prime are showing it whole without cutting away to give it over to the bobbleheads so they can blather. But better for your heart, soul, and sanity not to bother at all.</p>
<p>With that said, however, if you have to, absolutely have to, watch a convention, re-watch ours. All four days along with selected highlights are still <a href="https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available for streaming at the DNC’s website.</a> We had a good one, a joy-filled one, and had a better time than they’re going to have.</p>
<p><em>Photo up top was taken the other day by your faithful correspondent. The big baby&#39;s crib is on a street close to Uncle Merlin&#39;s boyhood home. Up and down the street and up and down most of the steets in town are Black Lives Matter signs and houses with rainbow flags and Biden-Harris signs that have sprung up seemingly overnight, replacing the Biden 2020 signs that had been there since February. What can I tell you. It&#39;s a Democratic town. Except for the house three doors down from Baby Trump. They&#39;re flying a Gadsden flag. A faded one. The neighbors probably do their best to ignore it.</em></p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge two weeks ago (or yesterday, in coronatime):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Microsoft had revealed the design of the Surface Duo back in
October, the company has kept the specs relatively secret. The
device includes two separate 5.6-inch OLED displays (1800 x 1350)
with a 4:3 aspect ratio that connect together to form a 8.1-inch
overall workspace (2700 x 1800) with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Unlike
foldables like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, the Surface Duo is using
real Gorilla Glass, and the displays are designed to work in a
similar way to multiple monitors on a Windows PC.</p>

<p>One big question over the Surface Duo has been the camera.
Microsoft is using an 11-megapixel f/2.0 camera, which will
include auto modes for low light, HDR multi-frame captures, and a
“super zoom” up to 7x. Both 4K and 1080p video recording will be
supported at 30fps and 60fps, with electronic image stabilization.
There’s only a single camera on the Surface Duo, which can be used
both for video calls and as a main camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I’m deeply intrigued by the Surface Duo but at the same time incredibly dubious that anyone wants this. I don’t get the confusion over whether it’s a phone or not. It can make phone calls and act as a phone, but Microsoft never calls it one. My take is it’s a folding tablet that might as well act like a phone if you have a cellular plan, in case that’s what you really want. But I’d guess most people who do get one of these will still carry a dedicated phone — I’ve been skeptical about giant ass phones for a decade now and I’ve been proven largely wrong (no pun intended) about the size of phones many people want to carry, but this is preposterous as something you might want to pocket.</p>

<p>People are dinging it for the broad bezels at the top and bottom but that’s just superficial. My fundamental skepticism is whether Android is actually a good OS for this, and whether there are actual use cases for this form factor regardless of OS and application support for the split screen. At $1,400 it’s clearly a premium product — is there a premium use case?</p>

    <p>Election Day is only a couple of months away, and a friend brings to my attention <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/">a new poll from Pew Research:</a></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861378"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 350px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861378" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_pew_2020_important_issues.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="1752"></figure>
<p>This seems relatively unsurprising except for one thing: violent crime. Why is that #5? A followup chart explains it:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861379"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 450px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861379" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_pew_2020_important_issues_comparison.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="1457"></figure>
<p>Among Trump voters, violent crime is #2 behind perennial favorite &#8220;the economy.&#8221; Why? Because Fox News and the rest of the gang have spent the past few months screaming about cities in flame, BLM &#8220;riots,&#8221; and crime capitals of the world. In fact, though, the best evidence we have suggests that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/upshot/murders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html">overall crime is <em>down</em> so far this year.</a> So is overall violent crime. The only thing that&#8217;s up is homicides. Through the first half of the year, there have been a few hundred more than in 2019.</p>
<p>Now, a spike in murders is no small thing. There&#8217;s something going on there, and we don&#8217;t know what it is. Still, those few hundred additional homicides are dwarfed by a drop in other violent crimes that measures in the thousands. And property crimes are down by tens of thousands. Generally speaking, you&#8217;re likely to be considerably safer in a big city than you were last year.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the broader fact that Democrats and Republicans simply care about different things. Here&#8217;s the Pew data arranged by the issues most important to Democrats and Republicans:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861392"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1264px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861392" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_top_issues_republicans.gif" alt="" width="1264" height="629"></figure>
<figure id="attachment_861393"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1264px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861393" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_top_issues_democrats.gif" alt="" width="1264" height="630"></figure>
<p>Republicans care about crime, immigration, and guns. Democrats barely even notice these issues. Conversely, Dems care about the pandemic, race inequality, and climate change. Republicans could care less about them. We are living in two different worlds.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00962ED2V01Y201910CAC049"><p>Many modern computer systems, including homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures, support shared memory in hardware. In a shared memory system, each of the processor cores may read and write to a single shared address space. For a shared memory machine, the memory consistency model defines the architecturally visible behavior of its memory system. Consistency definitions provide rules about loads and stores (or memory reads and writes) and how they act upon memory. As part of supporting a memory consistency model, many machines also provide cache coherence protocols that ensure that multiple cached copies of data are kept up-to-date. The goal of this primer is to provide readers with a basic understanding of consistency and coherence. This understanding includes both the issues that must be solved as well as a variety of solutions. We present both high-level concepts as well as specific, concrete examples from real-world systems.</p>
<p>This second edition reflects a decade of advancements since the first edition and includes, among other more modest changes, two new chapters: one on consistency and coherence for non-CPU accelerators (with a focus on GPUs) and one that points to formal work and tools on consistency and coherence.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/20/sciadv.abc5961"><p>Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic and that significant viral shedding may occur prior to symptom onset. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities to prevent disease spread. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing which identifies all positive subjects within a large set of samples using a single round of testing. Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing carrier detection. In our current study we pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools providing both an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency, as well as an 8-fold reduction in test costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like error correction codes and has similar limitations based on the frequency of errors/infections:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/20/sciadv.abc5961">
<p>Our current implementation of P-BEST was designed for a carrier rate of ~1%. To allow higher testing efficiency, i.e., to minimize the number of pools required to screen a given population, designs should vary according to the carrier rate. Pooling designs can differ by the number of pools, and by the number of samples per pool. Specifically, as the carrier rate in the population rises more pools are required to correctly identify all positive carriers in a single testing round. Moreover, the required number of samples per pool decreases with increasing the carrier rate. Conversely, when carrier rates are low, more efficient pooling designs can be used, i.e., less pools are required to test the same number of individuals, while the number of samples per pool should be increased.</p></blockquote>

<p>And restoring an iCloud backup is problematic because you can&rsquo;t just restore one app. Restoring your Lightroom data would also revert newer data from other apps. Maybe you could restore to a different iOS device and let Lightroom sync the restored photos to the cloud, hoping that none of you other apps upload old data to the cloud.</p>

<p>On the developer side, <em>moving</em> to subscriptions can be a gate to hell. They usually make <em>less</em> at first. Incidentally the first year you pay the higher fee. Over time they <em>can</em> make more&mdash;if you manage to keep your users. That is not a given. The switch from paid to subscription can cost you a fortune. Not technically. The technology is there. It will cost you: users. And angry users don&rsquo;t just leave, they rate you angrily and write angry comments. They feel harmed and they try to harm you as much as possible. Anonymous ratings, upvoting, and reviews make revenge fast, easy, and cheap.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>You might have noticed that there are no subscriptions for Apple&rsquo;s own productivity apps. They are either free, like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, or very expensive and paid, like Logic, FinalCut, Motion.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple is more likely to help, feature, and support a popular app if it has a subscription. Apple will still show interest in your future if you sell a lot of apps. If there is no subscription planned, Apple&rsquo;s interest vanishes in circles. They come back, showing interest in a featuring here and there, asking questions about your future, and if your response is &ldquo;no subscriptions&rdquo; or &ldquo;no subscriptions only&rdquo; their interest evaporates. Until they don&rsquo;t ask anymore.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We tried high prices, mid-range prices, low prices, free, and freemium. Getting Android users to pay for software is not for the feeble-hearted. So far, offering a free basic version with a choice between paid and subscription seems to be the only thing that works. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean we buy yachts, it means that we might be sustainable in one or two years.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re charging $5/year or $30 to buy the app.</p>

    <p>Last week featured a lovely sunrise to mark the start of the Democratic convention. Fair is fair, so this week features another one. This is &#8220;Sunrise Over the Swamp,&#8221; which seems appropriate for the GOP convention, I think.</p>

    <p>Hey, remember the poolboy who somehow got an investment from Jerry Falwell Jr. a few years ago for a vaguely defined venture involving a youth hostel? His name is Giancarlo Granda and he now says that ever since he was 20 years old he&#8217;s been having an affair with Falwell&#8217;s wife, Becki. But was it really an &#8220;affair&#8221;? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/08/24/us/politics/24reuters-usa-falwell-relationship-exclusive.html?searchResultPosition=1">According to Granda,</a> “Becki and I developed an intimate relationship and Jerry enjoyed watching from the corner of the room.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the Bible doesn&#8217;t condone this sort of thing, but I don&#8217;t really care. This isn&#8217;t a porn blog, it&#8217;s a politics blog.¹ So I&#8217;m mostly curious about what Republicans think of all this. Here&#8217;s Ari Fleischer, formerly one of George Bush&#8217;s press secretaries:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Prediction: The MSM, including NYT reporters on Twitter, will give this story more coverage than Tara Reade’s accusations against Joe Biden. Because that’s the way it works. Accuse a conservative: Get media attention. Accuse a Democrat: The press needs to think about it. <a href="https://t.co/bhYz6k16aC">https://t.co/bhYz6k16aC</a></p>
<p>— Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/1297939913103548417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Huh. My recollection is that Tara Reade got a mountain of coverage even though her accusations were pretty thin. To find the Falwell story, on the other hand, I had to search the <em>New York Times</em> site because it was nowhere on the front page.</p>
<p>That may change, of course, but my best guess is that the <em>Times</em> and other outlets will give this pretty low-key coverage, though everyone will inevitably finish things up with a 10,000 word, multiple-reporter, graphic-filled feature explaining the entire history of the Falwell clan. (The <em>New Yorker</em> will do 20,000 words.)</p>
<p>That said, how about some actual denunciation of Falwell? I may not care much if Jerry Jr. likes to watch, but supposedly conservatives do. So let&#8217;s hear it. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/24/21348295/rnc-2020-trump-stuart-stevens-it-was-all-a-lie">Or is Stuart Stevens right?</a></p>
<p>¹Yes, yes, I know: that&#8217;s a thin distinction sometimes.</p>

&#8220;One thing about a lot of pocket tools and multi tools is they often have a pretty crappy Phillips head screwdriver. The titanium pocket bit from Big Idea really solves that. It is a key chain based pocket bit or screwdriver bit that has a Phillips head on one side and a regular flathead on the other side. You can take the entire set of your keys and hold it almost like a handle, use the screwdriver, and have a lot of leverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other nice thing is that it comes in to two different packages a round and a hex. If you have the hex bit you can actually use it within some kind of a driver loop and have a lot of torque. I love it. Again, totally titanium so adds no extra weight really to my keys are nothing noticeable and it&#8217;s really a great bit of kit.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From a CBS News survey of over 2,000 registered voters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number of U.S. deaths from coronavirus has been been acceptable /
unacceptable:</p>

<p>Republicans: 57% / 43% <br />
Democrats: 10% / 90% <br />
Independents: 33% / 67%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. has over 176,000 deaths, and that number is growing by around 1,000 per day. According to the same poll, 73 percent of Republicans think the U.S. response to coronavirus is “going well”. This isn’t cult<em>ish</em> — it’s a cult. Either a majority of Republicans are sociopaths or they’re so ignorant they have no idea how much worse the U.S. has handled COVID-19 than other industrialized nations. <a href="https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/1297580905851236354">Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas, on COVID-19 deaths reported yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Italy: 3 <br />
France: 9 <br />
Japan: 14 <br />
Canada: 7 <br />
UK: 18 <br />
Germany: 3  </p>

<p>United States: 974</p>

<p>Population of countries above: 439 million <br />
Population of United States: 328 million</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s almost <em>over</em> for other nations. Here in the U.S. COVID-19 is rampaging.</p>

    <p>This is one of my pet peeves, so I beg your indulgence. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-economy-is-bouncing-backand-gaining-ground-on-the-u-s-11598280917?mod=hp_lead_pos10">This is from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> today:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the rest of the world struggles to contain the coronavirus, China’s recovery is gaining momentum, positioning it to further close its gap with the U.S. economy&#8230;.That bounceback, while far from China’s heady expansions of past years, <strong>should nonetheless help the world’s No. 2 economy move faster in catching up with the U.S.,</strong> which could shrink by as much as 8.0% in 2020.</p>
<p>It is also buttressing Beijing’s belief that China’s state-led model, which helped the country navigate the 2008-09 financial crisis with minimal pain, <strong>is better than the U.S.’s market system,</strong> emboldening Chinese leaders at a time of rising geopolitical competition with the U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s common practice to say that China&#8217;s economy is #2 in the world, or perhaps even #1 depending on how you do your currency conversions. And it&#8217;s true that China&#8217;s GDP is about $15 trillion compared to America&#8217;s $20 trillion. That&#8217;s pretty close, and China is growing faster. Eventually they&#8217;ll catch up.</p>
<p>But who cares? It&#8217;s like bragging that California has more hospitals than Oregon. Of course it does. California has ten times as many people. In the case of China, what matters is GDP per person, and on that score China is light years behind the US. Here&#8217;s the chart you knew was coming:</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_861291"  class="inline-image alignnone" style="max-width: 1270px;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-861291" src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog_china_gdp_per_capita.gif" alt="" width="1270" height="634"></figure>
<p>China&#8217;s GDP per person is about $10,000, compared to $65,000 in the United States. They aren&#8217;t even in the same ballpark, and it will be decades before they catch up to us—if they ever do.</p>
<p>There are obviously some legitimate reasons to look at overall GDP since it affects things like trade volume and military capacity, but most of the time it seems to be little more than an attempt at drama. For some reason we&#8217;re supposed to be afraid that China is going to take over the world, but that looks pretty ridiculous if you look at living standards and GDP per capita. So instead we&#8217;re spoon-fed total GDP, even though we almost never do that for any other country. Do you have any idea how Germany&#8217;s GDP compares to ours? Or Spain&#8217;s? Or Denmark&#8217;s? Here&#8217;s a hint: they&#8217;re a lot lower because they have a fraction of our population.¹ Everyone knows it would be a ridiculous comparison, which is why you never see it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to China, we hear about it all the time. We should knock it off.</p>
<p>¹For the record, roughly $4 trillion, $1 trillion, and $0.3 trillion. Does this tell you anything interesting at all?</p>

    <p>25 years ago, Windows 95 was released to great fanfare.</p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/win95-rotated.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="Windows 95 MacUser cover" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The magazine I worked at back then, <em>MacUser</em>, decided to offer up as a rejoinder a cover that said “Windows 95: So What?” It was originally intended to feature the Windows logo instead of “Windows 95” in type inside a big yellow circle, but the corporate lawyers intervened and said we couldn’t use the logo on our cover. (I always figured that the lawyers were just an excuse, and that our owner didn’t want to overly antagonize Microsoft, since Ziff-Davis also published both PC Magazine and PC/Computing magazine.)</p>
<p>Here’s the truth about Windows 95, though: it was devastating to the Mac. Before Windows 95, PCs were spectacularly bad. (Sorry, fans of Windows 3.1, but it was garbage.) Windows 95, on the other hand, lifted an enormous amount of features from the Mac and drastically improved usability. Long filenames, trash can, aliases, a desktop, easy app switching, the promise of plug-and-play peripherals—these are all things the Mac had and that PCs didn’t, and with the release of Windows 95, the gap between the operating systems closed substantially.</p>
<p>Was Windows 95 better than the Mac? Any Mac user at the time will tell you it absolutely wasn’t. But Windows just being <em>decent</em> made it that much harder to justify buying a Mac in an increasingly Windows-centric environment. Windows 95 didn’t make Windows good, but it made it <em>good enough</em>.</p>
<p>And the technical underpinnings of Windows 95, most notably its support for pre-emptive multitasking, was a shot to the heart of Mac OS. This is a feature that every operating system today has, where the system arbitrates between different processes and doles out processor time. But the classic Mac OS did no such thing. Once an app grabbed control of the processor, it kept it until it relinquished control. If you were downloading a file in the background and then did something in the foreground, that download would just… stop. It was very bad.</p>
<p>At the time Apple was desperately trying to create a re-archictected Mac OS called Copland, which would offer <em>limited</em> preemptive multitasking, with the promise to follow it up with a more robust OS version called Gershwin. A Copland developer preview appeared at WWDC one year—I got the t-shirt!—but was ultimately scrapped. Apple had to turn to outsiders to find a solution to its operating system problems, auditioning BeOS before finally purchasing NeXt Inc. and getting both the foundations of Mac OS X and Steve Jobs at once.</p>
<p>Mac OS X helped Apple build back up the Mac, but in the intervening years, the dominance of Windows accelerated, to the point where Microsoft essentially needed to prop up Apple with investment and promises of future Microsoft Office development in order to prevent the Mac from fading away entirely and giving Microsoft a complete PC monopoly.</p>
<p>Windows 95: So what? It made a huge impact on the Mac, driving Apple to the edge of oblivion. It’s kind of a miracle that the Mac survived it. So there.</p>

    <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports today that experts are having second thoughts about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-lockdowns-economy-pandemic-recession-business-shutdown-sweden-coronavirus-11598281419?mod=hp_lead_pos5">blunt lockdowns in response to a pandemic like COVID-19:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to Covid-19, lockdowns weren’t part of the standard epidemic tool kit, which was primarily designed with flu in mind&#8230;.<strong>By late March, [epidemiologists] had changed their minds.</strong> The sight of hospitals in Italy overwhelmed with dying patients shocked people in other countries. Covid-19 was much deadlier than flu, it was able to spread asymptomatically, and it had no vaccine or effective therapy.</p>
<p>&#8230;.Sweden took a different approach. <strong>Instead of lockdowns, it imposed only modest restrictions to keep cases at levels its hospitals could handle.</strong> Sweden has suffered more deaths per capita than neighboring Denmark but fewer than Britain, and it has paid less of an economic price than either, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Sweden’s current infection and death rates are as low as the rest of Europe’s, suggesting to some experts the country may be close to herd immunity. That is the point at which enough of the population is immune, due to prior exposure or vaccination, so that person-to-person transmission declines and the epidemic dies out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conventional wisdom these days is that Sweden&#8217;s moderate approach didn&#8217;t work. And it&#8217;s certainly true that their death rate from COVID-19 has been pretty high. At the same time, part of their strategy has always been to impose restrictions that people can tolerate for a very long time. This might produce higher than average death rates at first, but it might produce <em>lower</em> than average death rates over a full cycle of the infection, including the second COVID-19 wave expected to come in winter. So the big question is how Sweden will compare to other countries once we&#8217;ve been through that second wave.</p>
<p>For this reason, I remain extremely interested in the Swedish approach. It might be a failure, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll know for sure until next year.</p>

Apple introduced <a href="https://lowendmac.com/1994/blackbird-the-powerbook-500-series/">the PowerBook 500 series</a> to replace the original PowerBooks, and the original laptops proved to be a tough act to follow.

<p>The PowerBook 500 series was code-named Blackbird, and while they look boxy by today’s standards, they were much curvier than the original PowerBooks, made of lighter-weight plastics and with a redesigned keyboard that added a row of function keys (and a properly placed escape key). They were also, unfortunately, a lot heavier.</p>

It’s so easy to point and laugh now, like watching cave people discover fire, but at the time the little spinning trackball of the PowerBook was one of the device’s most iconic features. Explaining what was replacing it took a little bit of effort.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trackpad.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Someone had to popularize the trackpad.</figcaption></figure><p>It was “what Apple calls a <em>trackpad</em>, a slightly recessed rectangle of black composite material,” according to <em>MacUser</em>. Most MacUser editors who tried it preferred it to the trackball.</p>
<p>MacWEEK referred to it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A rectangular, high-resolution touch pad that controls the pointer. Called Midas TouchPad, it reportedly uses special tracking software to increase the distance the mouse travels across the screen the faster a user’s finger moves on the touch pad’s glass. Sources said Midas takes some getting used to, but it is both more reliable and accurate than a trackball.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Trackpad? TouchPad? Midas? I dunno. Whatever you call it, it’s still going strong 25 years later.</p>
<p>Blackbird was modular, too: it had two battery bays, but you could remove one of the batteries and instead replace it with other accessories that could be directly plugged into the PowerBook’s processor. The $199 PowerBook Expansion Module let you use PCMCIA expansion cards, which were becoming common on PC laptops. But the module was wonky and Mac support for PC Cards was almost nonexistent and the module didn’t even quite meet the actual PCMCIA standard so some stuff just… didn’t work.</p>
<p>Blackbird also rolled out just after the Mac had begun its transition to using PowerPC processors, but they were built with older-generation Motorola 68LC040 processors instead. To make Blackbird not seem instantly outdated (although it sort of was!), Apple promoted all the 500-series PowerBooks as “PowerPC upgradeable” via an add-on daughtercard that would be available in 1995. But at launch Apple had no price estimates or spec details for those upgrades.</p>
<p>Turns out, Apple was really slow to offer those upgrades. So slow, in fact, that they were beaten to the punch by Newer Technology, which offered the NUpowr upgrade card for 500-series PowerBooks. Not only did Newer beat Apple’s single upgrade to market, but the Newer upgrade cards ran a faster processor than the one in Apple’s kit.</p>

But about that battery…</figcaption></figure><p>It was a bumpy ride, but a year later, it got bumpier. In 1995, the PowerBook finally entered the PowerPC world, with the PowerBook 5300. (So named because Power PowerBook would’ve been a <em>really</em> dumb name.) The 5300 was a boxier design—in the articles from the time, the disappointment over the design is palpable (“The industrial design is still PC wannabe!” raved MacWEEK’s Andrew Gore)—and it made a bad first impression.</p>
<p>This is a laptop that shipped too soon, with buggy software—and it was savaged in early reviews. MacWEEK gave it “one of the worst [reviews the publication had] ever given an Apple product,” citing frequent system crashes that rendered two of their review models unusable. A software update <em>five months</em> after release fixed some of these problems, but many early 5300 logic boards were lemons, and needed to be completely replaced. Repairs could take as much as a month.</p>
<p>There was a built-in PC card slot that actually met the standard, which was good… because you’d need to use it if you wanted to connect the PowerBook to Ethernet or use a modem, since Apple removed both of those networking ports from the 5300. (That’s okay, I’m sure networking isn’t important to a laptop.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5300-side.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The floppy drive was removable, but it wasn’t a space large enough to hold a CD-ROM drive.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the Blackbird, the PowerBook 5300 also had two expansion bays. One was reserved for a swappable battery, and the other came with a floppy drive that could be swapped out for other devices—though very few of them every really came to fruition. The real tragedy here is that this was the heyday of the CD-ROM—people were playing Myst and reading Cinemania and watching a tiny, tiny QuickTime movie of A Hard Day’s Night on their desktop Macs—and Apple somehow designed the PowerBook 5300 with a removable storage bay that was too small to fit a CD-ROM disc.</p>
<p>It gets worse. The PowerBook 5300 shipped with a cool new battery technology, a Sony-supplied Lithium Ion battery. You can probably guess what happened next—this was the Galaxy Note of its era. A few of the Lithium Ion batteries caught fire, although fortunately not while in the hands of consumers. Regardless, Apple had to recall the 5300’s batteries and replace them with less efficient Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.</p>
<p>Talk about a messy roll-out: Here’s our new laptop! It caught on fire, wait, we’ll be right back! Now here’s our new laptop, now with 70 percent less battery!</p>

And for most of the summer of 1995, I’d read about the latest scandal involving Apple’s PowerBook 5300 roll-out disaster as I walked to buy my lunch at the sandwich shop across a large lawn from our office building. It’s a strong sense memory of mine: Lawn, sun, brown paper bag from Togo’s, and a copy of <em>MacWEEK</em> detailing just how terrible Apple’s laptops were doing.</p>
<p>The PowerBook 5300 series was star crossed from beginning to end. It survived for about a year before Apple had to kill it. It’s one of the greatest product failures in the company’s history, even if nobody remembers it today.</p>
<p>The cover of the December 1996 issue of MacUser has this line: “Has Apple fixed the PowerBook?”</p>
<p>Yeah, they did—by releasing the PowerBook 1400, a laptop that I dearly loved. But it really wouldn’t be until Steve Jobs returned and the “Wall Street” PowerBooks were released that Apple would regain its footing and start making truly great laptops once more.</p>

<h5><span style="color: #5b5b5b;">American G.I.’s with German children at the end of World War II. The soldier on the right, in the shadows where he always liked to operate, is Private Henry Kissinger.</span></h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In contrast to so many Americans, Kissinger has lived without hope, without expectations, and certainly without confidence in either the workings of democracy or the inevitability of progress. Policy, he has argued, must start from this grim vantage point. This is not a heartwarming perspective, but is there anyone looking out at the world today who would say that his pessimism is not a more sensible foundation for foreign policy than...optimism? That is why, given the current state of international relations, it is foolish, even dangerous, to ignore him. The lessons he has been trying to teach may not be to the liking of most people, but they are more important than ever before. ---from the introduction of <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-inevitability-of-tragedy-barry-gewen/1132051254?ean=9781324004059" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Inevitability of Tragedy: Henry Kissinger and His World”</a> by Barry Gwenn.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger?</p>
<p>I don’t mean “Why <em>would</em> I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger” as if I’m responding to a publisher’s come on or an overly enthusiastic headline on a review. I mean, plainly, why <em>do</em> I want to read a biography of Henry Kissinger, because I do---specifically, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-inevitability-of-tragedy-barry-gewen/1132051254?ean=9781324004059" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Inevitability of Tragedy”</a> by Barry Gwenn. It’s not just that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-myth-of-henry-kissinger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this review by Thomas Meaney in the New Yorker</a> makes it sound like an interesting and well-written book. Meaney’s review made me realize I don’t really know much about Kissinger.</p>
<p>Of course I know who he was and what he did. But I don’t know what made him the person he was. He seemed to have sprung, a fully formed monster, onto the national stage when I was in junior high, and stayed there until I graduated from college, despicable until the end. And all I cared to know about him and needed to know was that he was directly and purposefully responsible for the deaths of hundreds and hundreds and <em>hundreds</em> of thousands of human beings. I knew, or, actually learned as time went on, that he was a Harvard professor, an expert on foreign policy, with a reputation for the brilliance of his scholarship and thinking. And I got a kick out of it when a friend who knew about this stuff told me that he was the model for Peter Sellers’ portrayal of Doctor Strangelove, even though Kissinger was not a former Nazi, just the opposite, in fact, a Jew who served in the U.S. Army in Europe in World War II and took part in the liberation of a concentration camp. But I don’t think I ever seriously thought about how he thought and wrote his way into becoming a monster and the architect and chief henchman of Nixon’s policy of mass murder in Southeast Asia and South America. How that happened, how Kissinger became Kissinger is something I want to know----something I <em>should</em> know. Something I think we all need to know, particularly political journalists.</p>
<p>I think he’s worth knowing as a villain and not simply a monster because villains are interesting in their villainy and because this one got away with it. He not only got away with it. He’s still celebrated for it. Hillary Clinton bragged about her friendship with him when she was running for President, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>I’ve written and tweeted many times that the wonder isn’t that we elected a Donald Trump president; the wonder is we didn’t do it sooner. I think the trouble the political media had---and to a degree still has--covering Trump as the villain and monster he is, is they couldn’t get their collective heads around the fact that a villain and monster like him could get himself elected to any office, let alone the presidency, despite the many examples of villains and monsters who have risen to the top in any and every industry, including journalism. It’s as if they believe that Nixon was a one-off in the whole of American history. Kissinger is just one of the most egregious specimens.</p>
<p>So I just checked “The Inevitability of Tragedy” out of the library, and it’s gone right on top of the stack of the fifty-four books I’m convinced I’m going to read by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But as much as I’m looking forward to reading Gwenn’s biography, I’m eager to read the as yet unwritten novel by whoever out there is the contemporary equivalent of Gore Vidal and who would limit their story to Kissinger’s experience as a young soldier and build it around his friendship with this character...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1942, Kissinger was drafted into the U.S. Army. At Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, he befriended Fritz Kraemer, a German-American private fifteen years his senior, whom Kissinger would call “the greatest single influence on my formative years.” A Nietzschean firebrand to the point of self-parody—he wore a monocle in his good eye to make his weak eye work harder—Kraemer claimed to have spent the late Weimar years fighting both Communists and Nazi Brown Shirts in the streets. He had doctorates in political science and international law, and pursued a promising career at the League of Nations before fleeing to the U.S., in 1939. He warned Kissinger not to emulate “cleverling” intellectuals and their bloodless cost-benefit analyses. Believing Kissinger to be “musically attuned to history,” he told him, “Only if you do not ‘calculate’ will you really have the freedom which distinguishes you from the little people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kraemer sounds like a real-life Baron Munchusaen who may have embellished here and there but didn’t exaggerate to the point of telling fantastical lies, just enough to make him an unreliable narrator. Which would make him an interesting choice for narrator of young Kissinger’s story, although, probably because I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/burr-gore-vidal/1100012768?ean=9780375708732" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Burr”</a>, I imagine Kissinger doing the narrating.</p>
<p>But the model doesn’t have to be Vidal. Conrad, Dostoevsky, Graham Greene---all good models. It’s just that, like I said, I have Vidal on my mind. And now that I think of it, I’m surprised Vidal didn’t write the novel himself and I’m irrationally disappointed he didn’t. It would have made a perfect cap to the “Narratives of Empire”.</p>
<p>Maybe I should write it myself?</p>
<p>First I have to do the research and get a lot smarter.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s more from Gwenn’s introduction to “The Inevitability of Tragedy”...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 40 years since left government service, Kissinger has devoted himself largely to two goals: the burnishing of his reputation and instructing the American people in the principles of Realpolitik. The first of these has provoked intense controversy with detractors and admirers lining up on either side...The second, while it has not been ignored, has hardly elicited the kind of thoughtful discussion it deserve, and the reason for this, I would say, is that Kissingers’s thinking runs counter to what Americans believe or wish to believe. He challenges people to rethink their assumptions. Kissinger’s lessons about history, power, and democracy can be discomfiting, even painful, for those who insist that freedom and democracy are the aspirations of people everywhere or that America is some kind of moral beacon. To argue otherwise is to be, well, un-American.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Kissinger...learned from his personal experience, but the lessons he drew are [dark]...As an eyewitness to the rise of the Nazis to whom he lost many members of his family, he saw that democracy was not a universal desire and that, under certain circumstances, it woulc lead to the worst tyranny imaginable. Sometimes, when people “seize their rights,” they do so in order to deprive other people of their rights. Whereas [Condoleeza Rice, for example, as she writes in her book <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/democracy-condoleezza-rice/1125246256?ean=9781455540174" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Democracy”</a>], understands human history as moving in a forward direction with transcendent meaning, for Kissinger history is more like one damned thing after another, unpredictable and uncontrollable; the basis of foreign policy has to be a pursuit of the national interest because, in an uncertain world, that is the anchor of stability. When correctly conceived, it contributes to rational relations among nations, giving them a shared foundation for working out their antagonisms; everyone understands where everyone else is coming from. World order is an end in its own right, and those Americans who insist on trying to impose their democratic values on others are likely to be disrupters of the peace, hegemonists by another name, or in Kissinger’s language, “crusaders.” One can’t expect too much in foreign affairs. The task for policymakers in his view is a modest, essentially negative one---namely, not to steer the world along some preordained path to universal justice but to pit power against power to rein in the assorted aggressions of human beings and to try, as best they can, to avert disaster. This is a perspective shaped by pessimism and a dim view of humanity.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed something new in <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/08/bitbar-superduper-and-library-books/">yesterday’s scripts</a>: the shebang lines were</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve been using Python 3 for quite a while, but it’s been a version installed through <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, not one that came from Apple. The reasons are</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple didn’t provide a Python 3 until Catalina; and</li>
<li>I didn’t install Catalina on either of my Macs until this past month.</li>

<p>I intend to keep using the Anaconda-installed version as my regular Python because its environment has all the tools I regularly use in my work: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. But the BitBar scripts were a good way to try out Apple’s Python 3; they needed Python 3’s UTF-8 support<sup id="fnref:utf8"><a href="#fn:utf8" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and didn’t need any of those math/science libraries.</p>
<p>While I said above that Apple provides Python 3 in Catalina, that may be stretching the definition of “provide.” If you look in <code>/usr/bin</code>, you’ll find something called <code>python3</code>, but that something may be just a placeholder. If you haven’t installed the Command Line Developer Tools, trying to execute a script via <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> will get you an error message about an “invalid active developer path.” This happened to me on one of my Macs; presumably, the CLDTs had already been installed on the other Mac and were updated when I switched to Catalina.</p>
<p>If you need to install the CLDTs, <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/">this explanation by Flavio Copes</a> of how to do so via the <code>xcode-select</code> command is clear and concise. Once you’ve done so, you can test your new Python 3 by running</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3 --version
</code></pre>
<p>at the command line. You should get <code>Python 3.7.3</code> as the response. This was the version released over a year ago, which means its remarkably fresh for an Apple-supplied command-line tool.</p>
<p>If you need to install third-party libraries, as I did with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mechanize/">Mechanize</a> and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> libraries used in my library BitBar script, you’ll have to run the Python 3 version of <code>pip</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/pip3 install mechanize
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll probably get a warning that your version of <code>pip</code> isn’t up to date. As with Python 3 itself, the <code>pip</code> that comes from Apple is over a year old. It’ll still work.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I don’t expect to be using Apple’s Python 3 in the future, but it’s nice to see that Mac users can use a modern Python without resort to third-party systems like Homebrew or Anaconda.</p>

<p>Sometimes you feel like you&#8217;re running around in circles, not making any progress, when you&#8217;re on the verge of a breakthrough. An illustration of this comes from integration by parts.</p>
<p>A common example in calculus classes is to integrate <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> sin(<em>x</em>) using integration by parts (IBP). After using IBP once, you get an integral similar to the one you started with. And if you apply IBP again, you get exactly the integral you started with.</p>
<p>At this point you believe all is lost. Apparently IBP isn&#8217;t going to work and you&#8217;ll need to try another approach.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/ibp_expsin3.svg" alt="\begin{align*} \int e^x \sin x \, dx &amp;= -e^x \cos x + \int e^x \cos x \, dx \\ &amp;= e^x(\sin x - \cos x) - \int e^x \sin x \, dx\end{align*}" width="362" height="87" /></p>
<p>But then the professor pulls a rabbit out of a hat. By moving the integral on the right side to the left, you can solve for the unknown integral in terms of the debris IBP left along the way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" style="background-color: white;" src="https://www.johndcook.com/ibp_expsin2.svg" alt="\int e^x \sin x \, dx = \frac{e^x}{2}(\sin x - \cos x)" width="247" height="40" /></p>
<p>So you weren&#8217;t going in circles after all. You were making progress when it didn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that gathering unknowns to one side is a new idea; you would have seen that countless times before you get to calculus. But that&#8217;s not how integration usually works. You typically start with the assigned integral and steadily chip away at it, progressing in a straight line toward the result. The trick is seeing that a simple idea from another context can be applied in this context.</p>
<p>In the calculation above we first let <em>u</em> = <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> and <em>v&#8217;</em> = sin(<em>x</em>) on the left. Then when we come to the first integral on the right, we again set <em>u</em> = <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> and this time <em>v&#8217;</em> = cos(<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>But suppose you come to the second integral and think &#8220;This is starting to look futile. Maybe I should try something different. This time I&#8217;ll let <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup> be the <em>v</em>&#8216; term rather than the <em>u</em> term.&#8221; In that case you really will run in circles. You&#8217;ll get exactly the same expression on both sides.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say in calculus, or in life in general, whether persistence or creativity is called for. But in this instance, persistence pays off. If you set <em>u</em> to the exponential term both times, you win; if you switch horses mid stream, you lose.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the problem is that the winning strategy is to be persistent in your approach to IBP, but use your creativity at the end to realize that you&#8217;re nearly done, just when it may seem you need to start over.</p>

<p id="p4">The app, which packs unparalleled power for analyzing, visualizing, and understanding your notes, is beloved by researchers, writers, investigators, product managers, and teachers. That&rsquo;s because Tinderbox acts as a personal content assistant giving you the tools you need to discover connections and relationships between your notes that you might otherwise miss.</p>
<p id="p5">It&rsquo;s easy to get started by dragging out lines connecting your notes or use Tinderbox&rsquo;s wiki-like Ziplinks to link notes and ideas together. Best of all, Tinderbox adapts to the way you work. You can use mind maps with shapes, colors, and links to surface connections, or one of many other tools like outlines, word clouds, timelines, and dashboards. Each is a powerful way to gain new perspectives on your ideas, while adding as little or as much structure as you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p id="p6">Tinderbox also has agents and rules, and employs powerful AI tools to automatically identify names and places, look up addresses, and even suggest links. Of course the app integrates neatly with other apps too. Connect the app to Apple&rsquo;s Notes app, and notes you enter on your iOS devices or Mac can be automatically categorized in Tinderbox. Of course, the app works with apps like DEVONthink, Scrivener, Bookends, and others, plus there&rsquo;s <a href="https://forum.eastgate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a vibrant community</a>.</p>

    <p><p><img src="https://kk.org/cooltools/files/2020/08/ice-halo.jpg" /></p><p>I bought this <a href="https://geni.us/headache-hat">Headache Hat Ice Halo</a> &#8212; essentially an ice pack in the form of a headband &#8212; a year ago and it has been pretty life-changing for managing severe and prolonged migraines. I find the design of this headband helpful because it can deliver site-specific ice treatment for migraines. The headband is essentially a strip of ice cubes encased in a cloth cover with which you can shift around to target your worst pain.</p>
<p>For me, this more effective than the peppermint rollers which would try for a similar effect (at times the smell of these products is too much for me).</p>
<p>I like this version which is a headband versus a hat because it is space-efficient (there are full hat versions which would take up more freezer space). So long as I remember to leave it in the freezer, it is always available and can be reused over and over. I find the headband freezes quickly because the linked cubes are fairly small. Though I haven&#8217;t worn it in public, I think you could.</p>

    <p>My thanks to Wifi Dabba for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. I’ve never had a sponsor quite like Wifi Dabba — they’re looking for investors in the DF audience, not customers.</p>

<p>India is a huge battleground — maybe <em>the</em> battleground — for the soul of the open internet. Remember Facebook Basics from a few years ago, where Facebook tried to effectively own “the internet” in India with an offering that pretty much just offered Facebook’s own services? It didn’t work, but they’re back, having <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494033-facebook-to-invest-57-billion-in-indian-telecom-company">recently purchased a nearly $6 billion stake in India’s largest telco</a>. The root problem is the extreme expense required to deploy broadband. High costs naturally favor nation-states and existing telecom monopolies.</p>

<p>Wifi Dabba is attempting to solve India’s broadband problem from the bottom up. They’ve spent the last three years reinventing the network stack to lower the cost of broadband internet access. They use lasers instead of expensive underground fiber, and commodity components across the stack. This results in a network that is 100 times cheaper to deploy and 10 times cheaper for customers.</p>

<p>Right now they primarily serve their hometown of Bangalore, but are looking to expand nationwide. Their investors include YCombinator, VY Capital, and others — and they are looking for additional investors.</p>
